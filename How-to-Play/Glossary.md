## Glossary

**Game master (GM)**: The player who doesn’t run a character, but instead
guides the flow of the story and runs all the NPCs.

**Nonplayer character (NPC)**: Characters run by the GM. Think of them as
the minor characters in the story, or the villains or opponents. This
includes any kind of creature as well as people.

**Party**: A group of player characters (and perhaps some NPC allies).

**Player character (PC)**: A character run by a player rather than the GM.
Think of the PCs as the main characters in the story.

**Player**: The players who run characters in the game.

**Session**: A single play experience. Usually lasts a few hours. Sometimes
one adventure can be accomplished in a session. More often, one
adventure is multiple sessions.

**Adventure**: A single portion of the campaign with a beginning and an end.
Usually defined at the beginning by a goal put forth by the PCs and at
the end by whether or not they achieve that goal.

**Campaign**: A series of sessions strung together with an overarching story
(or linked stories) with the same player characters. Often, but not
always, a campaign involves a number of adventures.

**Character**: Anything that can act in the game. Although this includes PCs
and human NPCs, it also technically includes creatures, aliens, mutants,
automatons, animate plants, and so on. The word “creature” is usually
synonymous.
