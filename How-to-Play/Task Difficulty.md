## Task Difficulty

| **Task Difficulty** | **Description** | **Target No.** | **Guidance**                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | --------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0                   | Routine         | 0              | Anyone can do this basically every time.                                                      |
| 1                   | Simple          | 3              | Most people can do this most of the time.                                                     |
| 2                   | Standard        | 6              | Typical task requiring focus, but most people can usually do this.                            |
| 3                   | Demanding       | 9              | Requires full attention; most people have a 50/50 chance to succeed.                          |
| 4                   | Difficult       | 12             | Trained people have a 50/50 chance to succeed.                                                |
| 5                   | Challenging     | 15             | Even trained people often fail.                                                               |
| 6                   | Intimidating    | 18             | Normal people almost never succeed.                                                           |
| 7                   | Formidable      | 21             | Impossible without skills or great effort.                                                    |
| 8                   | Heroic          | 24             | A task worthy of tales told for years afterward.                                              |
| 9                   | Immortal        | 27             | A task worthy of legends that last lifetimes.                                                 |
| 10                  | Impossible      | 30             | A task that normal humans couldn’t consider (but one that doesn’t break the laws of physics). |
