## POOL, EDGE, AND EFFORT

Each of the three stats has two components: Pool and Edge. Your Pool
represents your raw, innate ability, and your Edge represents knowing
how to use what you have. A third element ties into this concept:
Effort. When your character really needs to accomplish a task, you apply
Effort.

(Your stat Pools, as well as your Effort and Edge, are determined by the
character type, descriptor, and focus that you choose. Within those
guidelines, however, you have a lot of flexibility in how you develop
your character.)

### POOL

Your Pool is the most basic measurement of a stat. Comparing the Pools
of two creatures will give you a general sense of which creature is
superior in that stat. For example, a character who has a Might Pool of
16 is stronger (in a basic sense) than a character who has a Might Pool
of 12. Most characters start with a Pool of 9 to 12 in most stats—that’s
the average range.

When your character is injured, sickened, or attacked, you temporarily
lose points from one of your stat Pools. The nature of the attack
determines which Pool loses points. For example, physical damage from a
sword reduces your Might Pool, a poison that makes you clumsy reduces
your Speed Pool, and a psionic blast reduces your Intellect Pool. You
can also spend points from one of your stat Pools to decrease a task’s
difficulty (see Effort, below). You can rest to recover lost points from
a stat Pool, and some special abilities or cyphers might allow you to
recover lost points quickly.

### EDGE

Although your Pool is the basic measurement of a stat, your Edge is also
important. When something requires you to spend points from a stat Pool,
your Edge for that stat reduces the cost. It also reduces the cost of
applying Effort to a roll.

For example, let’s say you have a mental blast ability, and activating
it costs 1 point from your Intellect Pool. Subtract your Intellect Edge
from the activation cost, and the result is how many points you must
spend to use the mental blast. If using your Edge reduces the cost to 0,
you can use the ability for free.

Your Edge can be different for each stat. For example, you could have a
Might Edge of 1, a Speed Edge of 1, and an Intellect Edge of 0. You’ll
always have an Edge of at least 1 in one stat. Your Edge for a stat
reduces the cost of spending points from that stat Pool, but not from
other Pools. Your Might Edge reduces the cost of spending points from
your Might Pool, but it doesn’t affect your Speed Pool or Intellect
Pool. Once a stat’s Edge reaches 3, you can apply one level of Effort
for free.

A character who has a low Might Pool but a high Might Edge has the
potential to perform Might actions consistently better than a character
who has a Might Edge of 0. The high Edge will let them reduce the cost
of spending points from the Pool, which means they’ll have more points
available to spend on applying Effort.

### EFFORT

When your character really needs to accomplish a task, you can apply
Effort. For a beginning character, applying Effort requires spending 3
points from the stat Pool appropriate to the action. Thus, if your
character tries to dodge an attack (a Speed roll) and wants to increase
the chance for success, you can apply Effort by spending 3 points from
your Speed Pool. Effort eases the task by one step. This is called
applying one level of Effort.

You don’t have to apply Effort if you don’t want to. If you choose to
apply Effort to a task, you must do it before you attempt the roll—you
can’t roll first and then decide to apply Effort if you rolled poorly.

Applying more Effort can lower a task’s difficulty further: each
additional level of Effort eases the task by another step. Applying one
level of Effort eases the task by one step, applying two levels eases
the task by two steps, and so on. However, each level of Effort after
the first costs only 2 points from the stat Pool instead of 3. So
applying two levels of Effort costs 5 points (3 for the first level plus
2 for the second level), applying three levels costs 7 points (3 plus 2
plus 2), and so on.

Every character has an Effort score, which indicates the maximum number
of levels of Effort that can be applied to a roll. A beginning
(first-tier) character has an Effort of 1, meaning you can apply only
one level of Effort to a roll. A more experienced character has a higher
Effort score and can apply more levels of Effort to a roll. For example,
a character who has an Effort of 3 can apply up to three levels of
Effort to reduce a task’s difficulty.

When you apply Effort, subtract your relevant Edge from the total cost
of applying Effort. For example, let’s say you need to make a Speed
roll. To increase your chance for success, you decide to apply one level
of Effort, which will ease the task. Normally, that would cost 3 points
from your Speed Pool. However, you have a Speed Edge of 2, so you
subtract that from the cost. Thus, applying Effort to the roll costs
only 1 point from your Speed Pool.

What if you applied two levels of Effort to the Speed roll instead of
just one? That would ease the task by two steps. Normally, it would cost
5 points from your Speed Pool, but after subtracting your Speed Edge of
2, it costs only 3 points.

Once a stat’s Edge reaches 3, you can apply one level of Effort for
free. For example, if you have a Speed Edge of 3 and you apply one level
of Effort to a Speed roll, it costs you 0 points from your Speed Pool.
(Normally, applying one level of Effort would cost 3 points, but you
subtract your Speed Edge from that cost, reducing it to 0.)

Skills and other advantages also ease a task, and you can use them in
conjunction with Effort. In addition, your character might have special
abilities or equipment that allow you to apply Effort to accomplish a
special effect, such as knocking down a foe with an attack or affecting
multiple targets with a power that normally affects only one.

(When applying Effort to melee attacks, you have the option of spending
points from either your Might Pool or your Speed Pool. When making
ranged attacks, you may spend points only from your Speed Pool. This
reflects that with melee you sometimes use brute force and sometimes use
finesse, but with ranged attacks, it’s always about careful targeting.)

## EFFORT AND DAMAGE

Instead of applying Effort to ease your attack, you can apply Effort to
increase the amount of damage you inflict with an attack. For each level
of Effort you apply in this way, you inflict 3 additional points of
damage. This works for any kind of attack that inflicts damage, whether
a sword, a crossbow, a mind blast, or something else.

When using Effort to increase the damage of an area attack, such as the
explosion created by an Adept’s Concussion ability, you inflict 2
additional points of damage instead of 3 points. However, the additional
points are dealt to all targets in the area. Further, even if one or
more of the targets resist the attack, they still take 1 point of
damage.

MULTIPLE USES OF EFFORT AND EDGE

If your Effort is 2 or higher, you can apply Effort to multiple aspects
of a single action. For example, if you make an attack, you can apply
Effort to your attack roll and apply Effort to increase the damage.

The total amount of Effort you apply can’t be higher than your Effort
score. For example, if your Effort is 2, you can apply up to two levels
of Effort. You could apply one level to an attack roll and one level to
its damage, two levels to the attack and no levels to the damage, or no
levels to the attack and two levels to the damage.

You can use Edge for a particular stat only once per action. For
example, if you apply Effort to a Might attack roll and to your damage,
you can use your Might Edge to reduce the cost of one of those uses of
Effort, not both. If you spend 1 Intellect point to activate your mind
blast and one level of Effort to ease the attack roll, you can use your
Intellect Edge to reduce the cost of one of those things, not both.

## STAT EXAMPLES

A beginning character is fighting a giant rat. The PC stabs their spear
at the rat, which is a level 2 creature and thus has a target number of
6. The character stands atop a boulder and strikes downward at the
beast, and the GM rules that this helpful tactic is an asset that eases
the attack by one step (to difficulty 1). That lowers the target number
to 3. Attacking with a spear is a Might action; the character has a
Might Pool of 11 and a Might Edge of 0. Before making the roll, they
decide to apply a level of Effort to ease the attack. That costs 3
points from their Might Pool, reducing the Pool to 8. But the points are
well spent. Applying the Effort lowers the difficulty from 1 to 0, so no
roll is needed—the attack automatically succeeds.

Another character is attempting to convince a guard to let them into a
private office to speak to an influential noble. The GM rules that this
is an Intellect action. The character is third tier and has an Effort of
3, an Intellect Pool of 13, and an Intellect Edge of 1. Before making
the roll, they must decide whether to apply Effort. They can choose to
apply one, two, or three levels of Effort, or apply none at all. This
action is important to them, so they decide to apply two levels of
Effort, easing the task by two steps. Thanks to their Intellect Edge,
applying the Effort costs only 4 points from their Intellect Pool (3
points for the first level of Effort plus 2 points for the second level
minus 1 point for their Edge). Spending those points reduces their
Intellect Pool to 9. The GM decides that convincing the guard is a
difficulty 3 (demanding) task with a target number of 9; applying two
levels of Effort reduces the difficulty to 1 (simple) and the target
number to 3. The player rolls a d20 and gets an 8. Because this result
is at least equal to the target number of the task, they succeed.
However, if they had not applied some Effort, they would have failed
because their roll (8) would have been less than the task’s original
target number (9).

## CHARACTER TIERS

Every character starts the game at the first tier. Tier is a measurement
of power, toughness, and ability. Characters can advance up to the sixth
tier. As your character advances to higher tiers, you gain more
abilities, increase your Effort, and can improve a stat’s Edge or
increase a stat. Generally speaking, even first-tier characters are
already quite capable. It’s safe to assume that they’ve already got some
experience under their belt. This is not a “zero to hero” progression,
but rather an instance of competent people refining and honing their
capabilities and knowledge. Advancing to higher tiers is not really the
goal of Cypher System characters, but rather a representation of how
characters progress in a story.

To progress to the next tier, characters earn experience points (XP) by
pursuing character arcs, going on adventures, and discovering new
things—the system is about both discovery and exploration, as well as
achieving personal goals. Experience points have many uses, and one use
is to purchase character benefits. After your character purchases four
character benefits, they advance to the next tier. Each benefit costs 4
XP, and you can purchase them in any order, but you must purchase one of
each kind of benefit (and then advance to the next tier) before you can
purchase the same benefit again. The four character benefits are as
follows.

Increasing Capabilities: You gain 4 points to add to your stat Pools.
You can allocate the points among the Pools however you wish.

Moving Toward Perfection: You add 1 to your Might Edge, your Speed Edge,
or your Intellect Edge (your choice).

Extra Effort: Your Effort score increases by 1.

Skills: You become trained in one skill of your choice, other than
attacks or defense. As described in Rules of the Game, a character
trained in a skill treats the difficulty of a related task as one step
lower than normal. The skill you choose for this benefit can be anything
you wish, such as climbing, jumping, persuading, or sneaking. You can
also choose to be knowledgeable in a certain area of lore, such as
history or geology. You can even choose a skill based on your
character’s special abilities. For example, if your character can make
an Intellect roll to blast an enemy with mental force, you can become
trained in using that ability, easing the task of using it. If you
choose a skill that you are already trained in, you become specialized
in that skill, easing related tasks by two steps instead of one.

(Skills are a broad category of things your character can learn and
accomplish. For a list of sample skills, see below.)

Other Options: Players can also spend 4 XP to purchase other special
options in lieu of gaining a new skill. Selecting any of these options
counts as the skill benefit necessary to advance to the next tier. The
special options are as follows:

Reduce the cost for wearing armor. This option lowers the Speed cost for
wearing armor by 1.

Add 2 to your recovery rolls.

Select a new type-based ability from your tier or a lower tier.

## CHARACTER DESCRIPTOR

To create your character, you build a simple statement that describes
them. The statement takes this form: “I am a \[fill in an adjective
here\] \[fill in a noun here\] who \[fill in a verb here\].”

Thus: “I am an *adjective noun* who *verbs*.” For example, you might
say, “I am a Rugged Warrior who Controls Beasts” or “I am a Charming
Explorer who Focuses Mind Over Matter.”

In this sentence, the adjective is called your descriptor.

The noun is your character type.

The verb is called your focus.

Even though character type is in the middle of the sentence, that’s
where we’ll start this discussion. (Just as in a sentence, the noun
provides the foundation.)

Your character type is the core of your character. In some roleplaying
games, it might be called your character class. Your type helps
determine your character’s place in the world and relationship with
other people in the setting. It’s the noun of the sentence “I am an
*adjective noun* who *verbs*.”

You can choose from four character types: Warriors, Adepts, Explorers,
and Speakers.

Your descriptor defines your character—it colors everything you do. Your
descriptor places your character in the situation (the first adventure,
which starts the campaign) and helps provide motivation. It’s the
adjective of the sentence “I am an *adjective noun* who *verbs*.”

Unless your GM says otherwise, you can choose from any of the character
descriptors.

Focus is what your character does best. Focus gives your character
specificity and provides interesting new abilities that might come in
handy. Your focus also helps you understand how you relate with the
other player characters in your group. It’s the verb of the sentence “I
am an *adjective noun* who *verbs*.”

There are many character foci. The ones you choose from will probably
depend on the setting and genre of your game.

(You can use the Flavors chapter to slightly modify character types to
customize them for different genres.)

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

Character types and foci grant PCs special abilities at each new tier.
Using these abilities usually costs points from your stat Pools; the
cost is listed in parentheses after the ability name. Your Edge in the
appropriate stat can reduce the cost of the ability, but remember that
you can apply Edge only once per action. For example, let’s say an Adept
with an Intellect Edge of 2 wants to use their Onslaught ability to
create a bolt of force, which costs 1 Intellect point. They also want to
increase the damage from the attack by using a level of Effort, which
costs 3 Intellect points. The total cost for their action is 2 points
from their Intellect Pool (1 point for the bolt of force, plus 3 points
for using Effort, minus 2 points from their Edge).

Sometimes the point cost for an ability has a + sign after the number.
For example, the cost might be given as “2+ Intellect points.” That
means you can spend more points or more levels of Effort to improve the
ability further, as explained in the ability description.

Many special abilities grant a character the option to perform an action
that they couldn’t normally do, such as projecting rays of cold or
attacking multiple foes at once. Using one of these abilities is an
action unto itself, and the end of the ability’s description says
“Action” to remind you. It also might provide more information about
when or how you perform the action.

Some special abilities allow you to perform a familiar action—one that
you can already do—in a different way. For example, an ability might let
you wear heavy armor, reduce the difficulty of Speed defense rolls, or
add 2 points of fire damage to your weapon damage. These abilities are
called enablers. Using one of these abilities is not considered an
action. Enablers either function constantly (such as being able to wear
heavy armor, which isn’t an action) or happen as part of another action
(such as adding fire damage to your weapon damage, which happens as part
of your attack action). If a special ability is an enabler, the end of
the ability’s description says “Enabler” to remind you.

Some abilities specify a duration, but you can always end one of your
own abilities anytime you wish.

(Because the Cypher System covers so many genres, not all of the
descriptors, types, and foci might be available for players. The GM will
decide what’s available in their particular game and whether anything is
modified, and they’ll let the players know.)

## SKILLS

Sometimes your character gains training in a specific skill or task. For
example, your focus might mean that you’re trained in sneaking, in
climbing and jumping, or in social interactions. Other times, your
character can choose a skill to become trained in, and you can pick a
skill that relates to any task you think you might face.

The Cypher System has no definitive list of skills. However, the
following list offers ideas:


### Ideas List

| Ideas| Ideas      | Ideas    |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Astronomy     | Climbing       | Geography     |
| Balancing     | Computers      | Geology       |
| Biology       | Deceiving      | Healing       |
| Botany        | Disguise       | History       |

| Sneaking      | Vehicle driving| Intimidation  |
| Woodworking   | Stealth        |               |
^Cypher-Ideas-List

You could choose a skill that incorporates more than one of these areas (interacting might include deceiving, intimidation, and persuasion) or that is a more specific version of one (hiding might be sneaking when you’re not moving). You could also make up more general professional skills, such as baker, sailor, or lumberjack. If you want to choose a skill that’s not on this list, it’s probably best to run it past the GM first, but in general, the most important thing is to choose skills that are appropriate to your character.

Remember that if you gain a skill that you’re already trained in, you become specialized in that skill. Because skill descriptions can be nebulous, determining whether you’re trained or specialized might take some thinking. For example, if you’re trained in lying and later gain an ability that grants you skill with all social interactions, you become specialized in lying and trained in all other types of interactions. Being trained three times in a skill is no better than being trained twice (in other words, specialized is as good as it gets).

Only skills gained through character type abilities or other rare instances allow you to become skilled with attack or defense tasks.

If you gain a special ability through your type, your focus, or some other aspect of your character, you can choose it in place of a skill and become trained or specialized in that ability. For example, if you have a mind blast, when it’s time to choose a skill to be trained in, you can select your mind blast as your skill. That would ease the attack every time you used it. Each ability you have counts as a separate skill for this purpose. You can’t select “all mind powers” or “all spells” as one skill and become trained or specialized in such a broad category.

In most campaigns, fluency in a language is considered a skill. So if you want to speak French, that’s the same as being trained in biology or swimming.

## Type

Character type is the core of your character. Your type helps determine your character’s place in the world and relationship with other people in the setting. It’s the noun of the sentence “I am an *adjective noun* who *verbs*.”

(In some roleplaying games, your character type might be called your character class.)

You can choose from four character types: Warrior, Adept, Explorer, and Speaker. However, you may not want to use these generic names for them. This chapter offers a few more specific names for each type that might be more appropriate to various genres. You’ll find that names like “Warrior” or “Explorer” don’t always feel right, particularly in games set in modern times. As always, you’re free to do as you wish. (Your type is who your character is. You should use whatever name you want for your type, as long as it fits both your character and the setting.)

Since the type is the basis upon which your whole character is built, it’s important to consider how the type relates to the chosen setting. To help with this, types are actually general archetypes. A Warrior, for example, might be anyone from a knight in shining armor to a cop on the streets to a grizzled cybernetic veteran of a thousand futuristic wars.

To further massage the four types for better use in various settings, different methods called flavors are presented in Flavors to help slightly tailor the types toward fantasy, science fiction, or other genres (or to address different character concepts).

Finally, more fundamental options for further customization are provided at the end of this chapter. 

Player Intrusion

A player intrusion is the player choosing to alter something in the campaign, making things easier for a player character. Conceptually, it is the reverse of a GM intrusion: instead of the GM giving the player XP and introducing an unexpected complication for a character, the player spends 1 XP and presents a solution to a problem or complication. What a player intrusion can do usually introduces a change to the world or current circumstances rather than directly changing the character. For instance, an intrusion indicating that the cypher just used still has an additional use would be appropriate, but an intrusion that heals the character would not. If a player has no XP to spend, they can’t use a player intrusion.

A few player intrusion examples are provided under each type. That said, not every player intrusion listed there is appropriate for all situations. The GM may allow players to come up with other player intrusion suggestions, but the GM is the final arbiter of whether the suggested intrusion is appropriate for the character’s type and suitable for the situation. If the GM refuses the intrusion, the player doesn’t spend the 1 XP, and the intrusion doesn’t occur.

Using an intrusion does not require a character to use an action to trigger it. A player intrusion just happens.

(Player intrusions should be limited to no more than one per player per session.)

Defense Tasks

Defense tasks are when a player makes a roll to keep something
undesirable from happening to their PC. The type of defense task matters
when using Effort.

Might defense: Used for resisting poison, disease, and anything else
that can be overcome with strength and health.

Speed defense: Used for dodging attacks and escaping danger. This is by
far the most commonly used defense task.

Intellect defense: Used for fending off mental attacks or anything that
might affect or influence one’s mind.

## Warrior

Fantasy/Fairy tale: Warrior, fighter, swordsman, knight, barbarian,
soldier, myrmidon, valkyrie

Modern/Horror/Romance: police officer, soldier, watchman, detective,
guard, brawler, tough, athlete

Science fiction: security officer, warrior, trooper, soldier, merc

Superhero/Post-Apocalyptic: hero, brick, bruiser

You’re a good ally to have in a fight. You know how to use weapons and
defend yourself. Depending on the genre and setting in question, this
might mean wielding a sword and shield in the gladiatorial arena, an
AK-47 and a bandolier of grenades in a savage firefight, or a blaster
rifle and powered armor when exploring an alien planet.

Individual Role: Warriors are physical,  
action-oriented people. They’re more likely to overcome a challenge
using force than by other means, and they often take the most
straightforward path toward their goals.

Group Role: Warriors usually take and deal the most punishment in a
dangerous situation. Often it falls on them to protect the other group
members from threats. This sometimes means that warriors take on
leadership roles as well, at least in combat and other times of danger.

Societal Role: Warriors aren’t always soldiers or mercenaries. Anyone
who is ready for violence, or even potential violence, might be a
Warrior in the general sense. This includes guards, watchmen, police
officers, sailors, or people in other roles or professions who know how
to defend themselves with skill.

Advanced Warriors: As warriors advance, their skill in battle—whether
defending themselves or dishing out damage—increases to impressive
levels. At higher tiers, they can often take on groups of foes by
themselves or stand toe to toe with anyone.

Warrior Background Connection

Your type helps determine the connection you have to the setting. Roll a
d20 or choose from the following list to determine a specific fact about
your background that provides a connection to the rest of the world. You
can also create your own fact.

| 16  | Your craftsman friend sometimes calls on you for help. However, they pay you well.                                                         |
| 17  | Your mentor wrote a book on martial arts. Sometimes people seek you out to ask about its stranger passages.                                |

WARRIOR PLAYER INTRUSIONS

You can spend 1 XP to use one of the following player intrusions,
provided the situation is appropriate and the GM agrees.

Perfect Setup: You’re fighting at least three foes and each one is
standing in exactly the right spot for you to use a move you trained in
long ago, allowing you to attack all three as a single action. Make a
separate attack roll for each foe. You remain limited by the amount of
Effort you can apply on one action.

Old Friend: A comrade in arms from your past shows up unexpectedly and
provides aid in whatever you’re doing. They are on a mission of their
own and can’t stay longer than it takes to help out, chat for a while
after, and perhaps share a quick meal.

Weapon Break: Your foe’s weapon has a weak spot. In the course of the
combat, it quickly becomes damaged and moves two steps down the object
damage track.

WARRIOR EXAMPLE

Ray wants to create a Warrior character for a modern campaign. He
decides that the character is an ex-military fellow who is fast and
strong. He puts 3 of his additional points into his Might Pool and 3
into his Speed Pool; his stat Pools are now Might 13, Speed 13, and
Intellect 8. As a first-tier character, his Effort is 1, his Might Edge
is 1, and his Speed Edge and Intellect Edge are both 0. His character is
not particularly smart or charismatic.

He wants to use a large combat knife (a medium weapon that inflicts 4
points of damage) and a .357 Magnum (a heavy pistol that inflicts 6
points of damage but requires the use of both hands). Ray decides not to
wear armor, as it’s not really appropriate to the setting, so for his
first ability, he chooses Trained Without Armor so he eases Speed
defense actions. For his second ability, he chooses Combat Prowess so he
can inflict extra damage with his big knife.

Ray wants to be fast as well as tough, so he selects Improved Edge. This
gives him a Speed Edge of 1. He rounds out his character with Physical
Skills and chooses swimming and running.

The Warrior can bear two cyphers. The GM decides that Ray’s first cypher
is a pill that restores 6 points of Might when swallowed, and his second
is a small, easily concealed grenade that explodes like a firebomb when
thrown, inflicting 3 points of damage to all within immediate range.

Ray still needs to choose a descriptor and a focus. Looking ahead to the
descriptor rules, Ray chooses Strong, which increases his Might Pool to
17. He also becomes trained in jumping and breaking inanimate objects.
(If he had chosen jumping as one of his physical skills, the Strong
descriptor would have made him specialized in jumping instead of
trained.) Being Strong also gives Ray an extra medium or heavy weapon.
He chooses a baseball bat that he’ll use in a pinch. He keeps it in the
trunk of his car.

For his focus, Ray chooses Masters Weaponry. This gives him yet another
weapon of high quality. He chooses another combat knife and asks the GM
if he could use it in his left hand—not to make attacks, but as a
shield. This will ease his Speed defense rolls if he has both knives out
(the “shield” counts as an asset). The GM agrees. During the game, Ray’s
Warrior will be hard to hit—he is trained in Speed defense rolls, and
his extra knife eases his defense rolls by another step.

Thanks to his focus, he also inflicts 1 additional point of damage with
his chosen weapon. Now he inflicts 6 points of damage with his blade.
Ray’s character is a deadly combatant, likely starting the game with a
reputation as a knife fighter.

For his character arc, Ray chooses Defeat a Foe. That foe, he decides,
is none other than someone in his company who was once a friend but went
rogue.

ADEPT

Fantasy/Fairy tale: wizard, mage, sorcerer, cleric, druid, seer,
diabolist, fey-touched

Modern/Horror/Romance: psychic, occultist, witch, practitioner, medium,
fringe scientist

Science fiction: psion, psionicist, telepath, seeker, master, scanner,
ESPer, abomination

Superhero/Post-Apocalyptic: mage, sorcerer, power-wielder, master,
psion, telepath

You master powers or abilities outside the experience, understanding,
and sometimes belief of others. They might be magic, psychic powers,
mutant abilities, or just a wide variety of intricate devices, depending
on the setting. (“Magic” here is a term used very loosely. It’s a
catch-all for the kinds of wondrous, possibly supernatural things that
your character can do that others cannot. It might actually be an
expression of technological devices, channeling spirits, mutations,
psionics, nanotechnology, or any number of other sources.)

Individual Role: Adepts are usually thoughtful, intelligent types. They
often think carefully before acting and rely heavily on their
supernatural abilities.

Group Role: Adepts are not powerful in straightforward combat, although
they often wield abilities that provide excellent combat support, both
offensively and defensively. They sometimes possess abilities that
facilitate overcoming challenges. For example, if the group must get
through a locked door, an Adept might be able to destroy it or teleport
everyone to the other side.

Societal Role: In settings where the supernatural is rare, strange, or
feared, Adepts are likely rare and feared as well. They remain hidden,
shadowy figures. When this is not the case, Adepts are more likely to be
common and forthright. They might even take leadership roles.

Advanced Adepts: Even at low tiers, Adept powers are impressive.
Higher-tier Adepts can accomplish amazing deeds that can reshape matter
and the environment around them.

(Adepts are almost always emblematic of the paranormal or superhuman in
some way—wizards, psychics, or something similar. If the game you’re
playing has none of that, an Adept could be a charlatan mimicking such
abilities with tricks and hidden devices, or a gadgeteer character with
a “utility belt” full of oddments. Or a game like that might not have
Adepts. That’s okay too.)

ADEPT PLAYER INTRUSIONS

When playing an Adept, you can spend 1 XP to use one of the following
player intrusions, provided the situation is appropriate and the GM
agrees.

Advantageous Malfunction: A device being used against you malfunctions.
It might harm the user or one of their allies for a round, or activate a
dramatic and distracting side effect for a few rounds.

Convenient Idea: A flash of insight provides you with a clear answer or
suggests a course of action with regard to an urgent question, problem,
or obstacle you’re facing.

Inexplicably Unbroken: An inactive, ruined, or presumed-destroyed device
temporarily activates and performs a useful function relevant to the
situation. This is enough to buy you some time for a better solution,
alleviate a complication that was interfering with your abilities, or
just get you one more use out of a depleted cypher or artifact.

| 1   | You served as an apprentice for an Adept respected and feared by many people. Now you bear their mark.                                                            |
| 2   | You studied in a school infamous for its dark, brooding instructors and graduates.                                                                                |
| 3   | You learned your abilities in the temple of an obscure god. Its priests and worshippers, although small in number, respect and admire your talents and potential. |
| 4   | While traveling alone, you saved the life of a powerful person. They remain indebted to you.                                                                      |
| 5   | Your mother was a powerful Adept while she lived, helpful to many locals. They look upon you kindly, but they also expect much from you.                          |
| 6   | You owe money to a number of people and don’t have the funds to pay your debts.                                                                                   |
| 7   | You failed disgracefully at your initial studies with your teacher and now proceed on your own.                                                                   |
| 8   | You learned your skills faster than your teachers had ever seen before. The powers that be took notice and are paying close attention.                            |
| 9   | You killed a well-known criminal in self-defense, earning the respect of many and the enmity of a dangerous few.                                                  |
| 10  | You trained as a Warrior, but your Adept predilections eventually led you down a different path. Your former comrades don’t understand you, but they respect you. |
| 11  | While studying to be an Adept, you worked as an assistant for a bank, making friends with the owner and the clientele.                                            |
| 12  | Your family owns a large vineyard nearby known to all for its fine wine and fair business dealings.                                                               |
| 13  | You trained for a time with a group of influential Adepts, and they still look upon you with fondness.                                                            |
| 14  | You worked the gardens in the palace of an influential noble or person of wealth. They wouldn’t remember you, but you made friends with their young daughter.     |
| 15  | An experiment you conducted in the past went horribly awry. The locals remember you as a dangerous and foolhardy individual.                                      |
| 16  | You hail from a distant place where you were well known and regarded, but people here treat you with suspicion.                                                   |
| 17  | People you meet seem put off by the strange birthmark on your face.                                                                                               |
| 18  | Your best friend is also an Adept. You and your friend share discoveries and secrets readily.                                                                     |
| 19  | You know a local merchant very well. Since you give them so much business, they offer you discounts and special treatment.                                        |
| 20  | You belong to a secretive social club that gathers monthly to drink and talk.                                                                                     |

ADEPT EXAMPLE

Jen wants to create an Adept—a sorcerer for a fantasy campaign. She
decides to be somewhat well rounded, so she puts 2 of her additional
points into each stat Pool, giving her a Might Pool of 9, a Speed Pool
of 11, and an Intellect Pool of 14. Her Adept is smart and quick. She
has an Intellect Edge of 1, a Might Edge of 0, and a Speed Edge of 0. As
a first-tier character, her Effort is 1. As her initial abilities, she
chooses Onslaught and Ward, giving her a strong offense and defense. She
also chooses Magic Training and rounds out her character with Scan,
which she hopes will be useful in gaining insight and information. For
this character, Onslaught, Ward, and Scan are all spells she has
mastered through years of training and study.

She can bear three cyphers. The GM gives her a potion that acts as a
short-range teleporter, a small charm that restores 5 points to her
Intellect Pool, and a fluid-filled flask that explodes like a fiery
bomb. Jen’s sorcerer is skilled with light weapons, so she chooses a
dagger.

For her descriptor, Jen chooses Graceful, which adds 2 points to her
Speed Pool, bringing it to 13. That descriptor means she is trained in
balancing and anything requiring careful movements, physical performing
arts, and Speed defense tasks. Perhaps she is a dancer. In fact, she
begins to develop a backstory that involves graceful, lithe movements
that she incorporates into her spells.

For her focus, she chooses Leads. This gives her training in social
interactions, which again helps round her out—she’s good in all kinds of
situations. Moreover, she has the Good Advice ability, which enables her
to be a focal point of her group.

Her spells and focus abilities cost Intellect points to activate, so
she’s glad to have a lot of points in her Intellect Pool. In addition,
her Intellect Edge will help reduce those costs. If she uses her
Onslaught force blast without applying Effort, it costs 0 Intellect
points and deals 4 points of damage. Her Intellect Edge will allow her
to save points to devote toward applying Effort for other purposes,
perhaps to boost the accuracy of Onslaught.

For her character arc, Jen chooses Aid a Friend. She decides that when
her sorcerer character was young, she had a magical mentor. That mentor
was later taken prisoner by a demon, so her character is always looking
for clues on how to find the demon and release her friend from bondage.

(GMs are always free to pre-select a type’s special abilities at a given
tier to reinforce the setting. In the fantasy setting of Jen’s sorcerer,
the GM might have said that all sorcerers (Adepts) start with Magic
Training as one of their tier 1 abilities. This doesn’t make the
character any less powerful or special, but it says something about her
role in the world and expectations in the game.)

EXPLORER

Fantasy/Fairy tale: Explorer, adventurer, delver, mystery seeker

Modern/Horror/Romance: athlete, explorer, adventurer, drifter,
detective, scholar, spelunker, trailblazer, investigative reporter

Science fiction: Explorer, adventurer, wanderer, planetary specialist,
xenobiologist

Superhero/Post-Apocalyptic: adventurer, crimefighter

You are a person of action and physical ability, fearlessly facing the
unknown. You travel to strange, exotic, and dangerous places, and
discover new things. This means you’re physical but also probably
knowledgeable.

Individual Role: Although Explorers can be academics or well studied,
they are first and foremost interested in action. They face grave
dangers and terrible obstacles as a routine part of life.

Group Role: Explorers sometimes work alone, but far more often they
operate in teams with other characters. The Explorer frequently leads
the way, blazing the trail. However, they’re also likely to stop and
investigate anything intriguing they stumble upon.

Societal Role: Not all Explorers are out traipsing through the
wilderness or poking about an old ruin. Sometimes, an Explorer is a
teacher, a scientist, a detective, or an investigative reporter. In any
event, an Explorer bravely faces new challenges and gathers knowledge to
share with others.

Advanced Explorers: Higher-tier Explorers gain more skills, some combat
abilities, and a number of abilities that allow them to deal with
danger. In short, they become more and more well-rounded, able to deal
with any challenge.

EXPLORER PLAYER INTRUSIONS

When playing an Explorer, you can spend 1 XP to use one of the following
player intrusions, provided the situation is appropriate and the GM
agrees.

Fortuitous Malfunction: A trap or a dangerous device malfunctions before
it can affect you.

Serendipitous Landmark: Just when it seems like the path is lost (or you
are), a trail marker, a landmark, or simply the way the terrain or
corridor bends, rises, or falls away suggests to you the best path
forward, at least from this point.

Weak Strain: The poison or disease turns out not to be as debilitating
or deadly as it first seemed, and inflicts only half the damage that it
would have otherwise.

EXPLORER EXAMPLE

Sam decides to create an Explorer character for a science fiction
campaign. This character will be a hardy soul who explores alien worlds.
They put 3 additional points into their Might Pool, 2 into their Speed
Pool, and 1 into their Intellect Pool; their stat Pools are now Might
13, Speed 11, and Intellect 10. As a first-tier character, their Effort
is 1, their Might Edge is 1, and their Speed Edge and Intellect Edge are
0. Their character is fairly well-rounded so far.

Sam immediately leaps in and starts choosing abilities. They pick Danger
Sense and Surging Confidence, thinking those abilities will be generally
useful. They also choose Practiced in Armor, reasoning that the
character wears high-tech medium armor when exploring. Last, they choose
Knowledge Skills and select geology and biology to help during
interplanetary explorations.

Sam’s Explorer can bear two cyphers, which in this setting involve
nanotechnology. The GM decides that one is a nanite injector that grants
a +1 bonus to Might Edge when used, and the other is a device that can
create one simple handheld object the user wishes.

Sam’s Explorer is not really geared toward fighting, but sometimes the
universe is a dangerous place, so they note that they’re carrying a
medium blaster as well.

Sam still needs a descriptor and a focus. Looking to the Descriptor
chapter, they choose Hardy, which increases their Might Pool to 17. They
also heal more quickly and can operate better when injured. They’re
trained in Might defense but have an inability with initiative; however,
it’s effectively canceled out by their Danger Sense (and vice versa).
Sam could go back and select something else instead of Danger Sense, but
they like it and decide to keep it. Overall, the descriptor ends up
making the character tough but a little slow.

For their focus, Sam chooses Explores Dark Places (in this case, weird
ruins of alien civilizations). This gives the character a bunch of
additional skills: searching, listening, climbing, balancing, and
jumping. They’re quite the capable Explorer.

For their character arc, Sam chooses Enterprise. Exploring alien places
sometimes turns up strange relics, and Sam figures they might be able to
set up a service to reliably transport these items to responsible third
parties, rather than allow them to fall into the hands of pirates and
rich private collectors. For a small fee, of course.

SPEAKER

Fantasy/Fairy tale: bard, speaker, skald, emissary, priest, advocate

Modern/Horror/Romance: diplomat, charmer, face, spinner, manipulator,
minister, mediator, lawyer

Science fiction: diplomat, empath, glam, consul, legate

Superhero/Post-Apocalyptic: charmer, mesmerist, puppet master

You’re good with words and good with people. You talk your way past
challenges and out of jams, and you get people to do what you want.

Individual Role: Speakers are smart and charismatic. They like people
and, more important, they understand them. This helps speakers get
others to do what needs to be done.

Group Role: The Speaker is often the face of the group, serving as the
person who speaks for all and negotiates with others. Combat and action
are not a Speaker’s strong suits, so other characters sometimes have to
defend the Speaker in times of danger.

Societal Role: Speakers are frequently political or religious leaders.
Just as often, however, they are con artists or criminals.

Advanced Speakers: Higher-tier speakers use their abilities to control
and manipulate people as well as aid and nurture their friends. They can
talk their way out of danger and even use their words as weapons.

SPEAKER PLAYER INTRUSIONS

When playing a Speaker, you can spend 1 XP to use one of the following
player intrusions, provided the situation is appropriate and the GM
agrees.

Friendly NPC: An NPC you don’t know, someone you don’t know that well,
or someone you know but who hasn’t been particularly friendly in the
past chooses to help you, though doesn’t necessarily explain why. Maybe
they’ll ask you for a favor in return afterward, depending on how much
trouble they go to.

Perfect Suggestion: A follower or other already-friendly NPC suggests a
course of action with regard to an urgent question, problem, or obstacle
you’re facing.

Unexpected Gift: An NPC hands you a physical gift you were not
expecting, one that helps put the situation at ease if things seem
strained, or provides you with a new insight for understanding the
context of the situation if there’s something you’re failing to
understand or grasp.

SPEAKER STAT POOLS

Your type helps determine the connection you have to the setting. Roll a
d20 or choose from the following list to determine a specific fact about
your background that provides a connection to the rest of the world. You
can also create your own fact.

|     |                                                                                                                                                            |

| 1   | One of your parents was a famous entertainer in their early years and hoped you would excel in the same medium.                                            |
| 2   | When you were a teenager, one of your siblings went missing and is presumed dead. The shock rent your family, and it’s something you’ve never gotten over. |
| 3   | You were inducted into a secret society that claims to hold and protect esoteric knowledge opposing the forces of evil.                                    |
| 4   | You lost one of your parents to alcoholism. They may still be alive, but you’d be hard pressed to find forgiveness.                                        |
| 5   | You have no memory of anything that happened to you before the age of 18.                                                                                  |
| 6   | Your grandparents raised you on a farm far from bustling urban centers. You like to think the instruction they gave you prepared you for anything.         |
| 7   | As an orphan, you had a difficult childhood, and your entry into adulthood was challenging.                                                                |
| 8   | You grew up in extreme poverty, among criminals. You still have some connections with the old neighborhood.                                                |
| 9   | You served as an envoy for a powerful and influential person in the past, and they still look upon you with favor.                                         |
| 10  | You have an annoying rival who always seems to get in your way or foil your plans.                                                                         |
| 11  | You’ve worked yourself into the position of spokesperson for an organization or company of some importance.                                                |
| 12  | Your neighbors were murdered, and the mystery remains unsolved.                                                                                            |
| 13  | You have traveled extensively, and during that time you accumulated quite a collection of strange souvenirs.                                               |
| 14  | Your childhood sweetheart ended up with your best friend (now your ex-best friend).                                                                        |
| 15  | You are part of a maligned minority, but you work to bring the injustice of your status to public attention.                                               |
| 16  | You’re part owner of a local bar, where you’re something of a whiz in creating specialty cocktails.                                                        |
| 17  | You once ran a con that cheated important people out of money, and they want revenge.                                                                      |
| 18  | You used to act in a traveling theater, and they remember you fondly (as do people in the places you visited).                                             |
| 19  | You are in a close romantic relationship with someone in local politics.                                                                                   |
| 20  | Someone out there tries to pose as you, using your identity, often for nefarious ends. You’ve never met the culprit, but you’d certainly like to.          |

SPEAKER EXAMPLE

Mary wants to create a Speaker for a Lovecraftian horror campaign. She
puts 3 of her additional stat points into her Intellect Pool and 3 into
her Speed Pool; her stat Pools are now Might 8, Speed 12, and Intellect
14. As a first-tier character, her Effort is 1, her Might Edge and Speed
Edge are 0, and her Intellect Edge is 1. She’s smart and charismatic but
not particularly tough.

Mary chooses Fast Talk and Spin Identity to help get into places and
learn things she wants to know. She’s a bit of a con artist. She’s good
to her friends, however, and chooses Encouragement as well. Mary rounds
out her first-tier abilities with Interaction Skills (deceiving and
persuasion).

A Speaker normally starts with two cyphers, but the GM rules that
characters in this campaign start with only one—something creepy
relating to their background. Mary’s cypher is an odd pocket watch given
to her by her grandfather. She doesn’t know how or why, but when
activated, the watch allows her to take twice as many actions for three
rounds.

Mary’s character carries a small knife hidden in her bag in case of
trouble. As a light weapon, it inflicts 2 points of damage, but attacks
with it are eased.

Mary chooses Resilient for her descriptor and decides that she can
probably learn the truth behind some of the strange things that she’s
heard about without feeling too much trauma if it’s horrible. Resilient
increases her Might Pool to 10 and her Intellect Pool to 16. She’s
trained in Might and Intellect defense actions and gains an extra
recovery roll each day. At first, Mary is sad that her descriptor gives
her an inability in knowledge and puzzle tasks, but then she realizes
that the flaw fits her character well—she’s better at getting people to
tell her what she needs to know than at figuring out the information
herself.

For her focus, Mary chooses Moves Like a Cat, granting her a final Speed
Pool of 18 and training in balance. In the end, she’s graceful and
quick, charismatic, and hardier than she initially thought thanks to her
drive. She’s ready to investigate the weird.

For her character arc, Mary chooses Fall From Grace. She decides she’s
had an obsession with a strange tome that’s been in her family for
generations, and her character is drawn to its strange languages and
rituals.

FANTASY CHARACTER OPTIONS

In some cases, the ideas here require minor changes to the flavor
described in the character options; you should work with your GM to make
sure these changes are suitable for the campaign. Most of the foci in
this section appear in the Cypher System; foci with an asterisk (\*) are
found later in this document. Some of these options recommend swapping
out a type ability for an ability from one of the character flavors such
as combat, magic, or stealth. 

Alchemist: In the sense that an alchemist is someone who makes magical
items or similar types of things, Adept and Explorer are appropriate
type choices for academic alchemists. For a general sort of alchemist
who makes potions of magical effects, choose the Masters Spells focus
(instead of spells, you learn potions). For one who transforms into a
powerful and dangerous creature, choose Howls at the Moon. For one who
loves throwing bombs, choose Bears a Halo of Fire. For a healer, choose
Works Miracles.

Assassin/Spy: Explorer and Warrior are good type choices for an assassin
character. Appropriate foci are Masters Weaponry, Moves Like a Cat,
Murders, and Works the Back Alleys. 

Barbarian: A barbarian character is probably a Warrior or (to focus a
little more on skills than combat) an Explorer. Good foci to choose from
are Lives in the Wilderness, Masters Weaponry, Needs No Weapon, Never
Says Die, Performs Feats of Strength, and Rages. 

Bard: Bards in fantasy fiction and games are troubadours, minstrels, and
storytellers, perhaps with a supernatural element. Bards are usually
Explorers or Speakers. Appropriate foci are Entertains, Helps Their
Friends, Infiltrates, and Masters Spells. 

Cleric or Priest: Academic clerics are usually Adepts or Speakers, but
martial clerics are often Warriors (perhaps with magic flavor). For a
typical cleric with a versatile set of abilities, choose the Channels
Divine Blessings focus. 

Cleric (death): Consorts With the Dead, Shepherds Spirits 

Cleric (knowledge): Learns Quickly, Sees Beyond, Would Rather Be
Reading 

Cleric (life): Defends the Weak, Shepherds the Community, Works Miracles

Cleric (light): Blazes With Radiance, Channels Divine Blessings 

Cleric (storm): Rides the Lightning, Thunders 

Cleric (trickery): Takes Animal Shape\* (also see options for rogues)

Cleric (war): Masters Weaponry (also see options for fighters)

Druid: As a very specific sort of nature priest, a druid character is
usually an Adept or Explorer (in either case probably using the magic
flavor). A typical druid probably has Channels Divine Blessings or Lives
in the Wilderness as a focus, but for more specific options, see the
following foci: 

Druid (animal companion): Controls Beasts, Masters the Swarm 

Druid (elemental): Abides in Stone, Bears a Halo of Fire, Moves Like the
Wind, Rides the Lightning, Wears a Sheen of Ice 

Druid (nature affinity): Speaks for the Land 

Druid (transformation): Abides in Stone, Takes Animal Shape\*, Walks the
Wild Woods\*

Fighter: Fighters almost always have the Warrior type, but some are
Explorers. A typical fighter probably has a direct focus like Masters
Weaponry or Wields an Enchanted Weapon\*. For additional options based
on choosing a specific fighting role, see the following: 

Fighter (guardian): Brandishes an Exotic Shield, Defends the Gate,
Masters Defense, Never Says Die, Stands Like a Bastion. 

Fighter (melee): Fights Dirty, Fights With Panache, Looks For Trouble,
Needs No Weapon, Wields Two Weapons at Once 

Fighter (ranged): Is Licensed to Carry, Throws With Deadly Accuracy

Gunslinger: A gunslinger is probably a Warrior or Explorer, but some are
Speakers with combat flavor. Appropriate foci are Is Licensed to Carry,
Masters Weaponry, Sailed Beneath the Jolly Roger, and Wields an
Enchanted Weapon\*. 

Inquisitor: Inquisitors are usually Explorers, Speakers, or Warriors,
depending on whether their inclinations are for having many skills,
being good at interacting with people, or combat. Appropriate foci are
Infiltrates, Metes Out Justice, and Operates Undercover. 

Merchant: An Explorer with a focus dealing with social interactions,
like Entertains or Leads, would make a good merchant character, but the
more obvious choice would be a Speaker.

Monk or Martial Artist: As masters of unarmed combat, monks are usually
Warriors or Explorers (perhaps with a combat flavor). Appropriate foci
are Fights With Panache, Needs No Weapon, and Throws With Deadly
Accuracy. 

Paladin/Holy Knight/Paragon: As holy warriors who mix martial prowess
and magic, paladins are usually Warriors or Explorers (in either case,
perhaps modified with the magic flavor). Good foci for this type of
character include Defends the Gate, Defends the Weak, Metes Out Justice,
Slays Monsters, and Wields an Enchanted Weapon\*.

Ranger: Rangers mix combat and skills, and therefore are usually
Explorers (perhaps with combat flavor) or Warriors (perhaps with skills
and knowledge flavor). Appropriate foci for a ranger are Controls
Beasts, Hunts, Lives in the Wilderness, Slays Monsters, Throws With
Deadly Accuracy, and Wields Two Weapons at Once. 

Rogue or Thief: Most rogue-type characters are Explorers, but an
interaction-focused rogue could easily be a Speaker (perhaps with
stealth flavor). Good foci for rogues are Explores Dark Places, Fights
Dirty, Hunts, Infiltrates, Is Wanted by the Law, Moves Like a Cat,
Sailed Beneath the Jolly Roger, and Works the Back Alleys. 

Sorcerer: Sorcerers, for our purpose here, are mages who have inherent
magical abilities (as opposed to wizards, who study long and hard to get
their spells). Most sorcerers are Adepts, but some are Explorers or
Speakers. The Masters Spells focus gives a typical sorcerer an effective
set of abilities, and most foci choices provide a themed set of spells.
For sorcerers of various magical bloodlines, see the following: 

Sorcerer (angel): Blazes With Radiance, Channels Divine Blessings, Keeps
a Magic Ally 

Sorcerer (destiny): Descends From Nobility, Was Foretold

Sorcerer (dragon): Bears a Halo of Fire, Rides the Lightning, Wears a
Sheen of Ice

Sorcerer (elemental): Abides in Stone, Bears a Halo of Fire, Employs
Magnetism, Moves Like the Wind, Rides the Lightning, Wears a Sheen of
Ice 

Sorcerer (fey): Takes Animal Shape\* 

Sorcerer (fiend): Bears a Halo of Fire, Keeps a Magic Ally 

Sorcerer (undead): Consorts With the Dead, Shepherds Spirits

Trickster or Con Artist: These clever folks are typically Speakers,
although they could be Adepts if they are very magical (or Explorers if
they aren’t magical at all). Foci choices include Fights Dirty, Works
the Back Alleys, or Entertains. 

War-wizard: For those unusual characters who use a mix of weapon attacks
and spells, play a Warrior with magic flavor or an Expert with combat or
magic flavor. Appropriate foci include Fights With Panache, Masters
Weaponry, and Wields an Enchanted Weapon\*. 

Warlock or Witch: For the purposes of this list, warlocks and witches
are mages who gain magical power from pacts they make with otherworldly
entities. Most warlocks are Adepts, but Explorers and Speakers (perhaps
with magic flavor) can be interesting options. Fun foci for a warlock
include Dances With Dark Matter, Keeps a Magic Ally, Masters the Swarm,
Separates Mind From Body, and Was Foretold, but (depending on the patron
and pact) most sorcerer and wizard foci work just as well. 

Wild Mage: Those who use chaotic magic are usually Adepts, but a dabbler
might be an Explorer or Speaker with the magic flavor. The best focus
that suits this theme is Uses Wild Magic\*.

Wizard: For the purposes of this list, wizards study magical lore at
length to learn the ways of spellcasting (as opposed to sorcerers,
warlocks, and so on). Wizards are usually Adepts, but a person-oriented
wizard might be a Speaker (perhaps with the magic flavor). For a
generalist wizard who has a variety of spells, choose the Masters Spells
focus. For more specific kinds of wizards, see the following: 

Wizard (abjurer): Absorbs Energy, Focuses Mind Over Matter, Wears a
Sheen of Ice 

Wizard (conjurer or summoner): Controls Beasts, Keeps a Magic Ally 

Wizard (diviner): Learns Quickly, Sees Beyond, Separates Mind From Body,
Solves Mysteries Wizard (enchanter): Commands Mental Powers, Leads 

Wizard (evoker): Bears a Halo of Fire, Blazes With Radiance, Rides the
Lightning, Thunders, Wears a Sheen of Ice 

Wizard (illusionist): Awakens Dreams, Crafts Illusions 

Wizard (necromancer): Consorts With the Dead, Shepherds Spirits 

Wizard (transmuter): Controls Gravity, Focuses Mind Over Matter, Takes
Animal Shape\*

PREPARED VS. SPONTANEOUS SPELLCASTING

Magical characters get their abilities (which might be spells, rituals,
or something else) from their type and focus, and they can use these
abilities as they see fit as long as they spend the required Pool
points. This technically makes them more like spontaneous casters. If
you’d like to play something more like a prepared-caster wizard with a
large selection of abilities that you narrow down each day, consider a
spellcasting-oriented focus like Channels Divine Blessings, Masters
Spells, or Speaks for the Land, and consider augmenting it with the
optional spellcasting rule.

FURTHER CUSTOMIZATION

The rules in this section are more advanced and always involve the GM.
They can be used by the GM to tailor a type to better fit the genre or
setting, or by a player and a GM to tweak a character to fit a concept.

MODIFYING TYPE ASPECTS

The following aspects of the four character types can be modified at
character creation. Other abilities should not be changed.

Stat Pools: Each character type has a starting stat Pool value. A player
can exchange points between their Pools on a one-for-one basis. For
example, they can trade 2 points of Might for 2 points of Speed.
However, no starting stat Pool should be higher than 20.

Edge: A player can start with an Edge of 1 in whichever stat they wish.

Cypher Use: If a character gives up the ability to bear one cypher, they
gain an additional skill of their choice.

Weapons: Some types have static first-tier abilities that let them use
light, medium, and/or heavy weapons without a penalty. Warriors can use
all weapons, Explorers can use light and medium weapons, and Adepts and
Speakers can use light weapons. Any one of these weapon abilities can be
sacrificed to gain training in a different skill of the player’s choice.

DRAWBACKS AND PENALTIES

In addition to other customization options, a player can choose to take
drawbacks or penalties to gain further advantages.

Weakness: A weakness is, essentially, the opposite of Edge. If you have
a weakness of 1 in Speed, all Speed actions that require you to spend
points cost 1 additional point from your Pool. At any time, a player can
give their character a weakness in one stat and, in exchange, gain +1 to
their Edge in one of the other two stats. So a PC can take a weakness of
1 in Speed to gain +1 to their Might Edge.

Normally, you can have a weakness only in a stat in which you have an
Edge of 0. Further, you can’t have more than one weakness, and you can’t
have a weakness greater than 1 unless the additional weakness comes from
another source (such as a disease or disability arising from actions or
conditions in the game).

Inabilities: Inabilities are like negative skills. They make one type of
task harder by hindering it. If a character chooses to take an
inability, they gain a skill of their choice. Normally, a character can
have only one inability unless the additional inability comes from
another source (such as a descriptor or a disease or disability arising
from actions or conditions in the game).

Flavor

Flavors are groups of special abilities the GM and players can use to
alter a character type to make it more to their liking or more
appropriate to the genre or setting. For example, if a player wants to
create a magic-using thief character, she could play an Adept with
stealth flavoring. In a science fiction setting, a Warrior might also
have knowledge of machinery, so the character could be flavored with
technology.

At a given tier, abilities from a flavor are traded one for one with
standard abilities from a type. So to add the Danger Sense stealth
flavor ability to a Warrior, something else—perhaps Bash—must be
sacrificed. Now that character can choose Danger Sense as they would any
other first-tier warrior ability, but they can never choose Bash.

The GM should always be involved in flavoring a type. For example, they
might know that for their science fiction game, they want a type called
a “Glam,” which is a Speaker flavored with certain technology
abilities—specifically those that make the character a flamboyant
starship pilot. Thus, they exchange the first-tier abilities Spin
Identity and Inspire Aggression for the technology flavor abilities
Datajack and Tech Skills so the character can plug into the ship
directly and can take piloting and computers as skills.

In the end, flavor is mostly a tool for the GM to easily create
campaign-specific types by making a few slight alterations to the four
base types. Although players may wish to use flavors to get the
characters they want, remember that they can also shape their PCs with
descriptors and foci very nicely.

The flavors available are stealth, technology, magic, combat, and skills
and knowledge.

The full description for each listed ability can be found in the
Abilities chapter, which also contains descriptions for type and focus
abilities in a single vast catalog.

STEALTH FLAVOR

Characters with the stealth flavor are good at sneaking around,
infiltrating places they don’t belong, and deceiving others. They use
these abilities in a variety of ways, including combat. An Explorer with
stealth flavor might be a thief, while a Warrior with stealth flavor
might be an assassin. An Explorer with stealth flavor in a superhero
setting might be a crimefighter who stalks the streets at night.

TECHNOLOGY FLAVOR

Characters with a flavor of technology typically are from science
fiction or at least modern-day  
settings (although anything is possible). They excel at using, dealing
with, and building machines. An Explorer with technology flavor might be
a starship pilot, and a Speaker flavored with technology could be a
techno-priest.

Some of the less computer-oriented abilities might be appropriate for a
steampunk character, while a modern-day character could use some of the
abilities that don’t involve starships or ultratech.

MAGIC FLAVOR

You know a little about magic. You might not be a wizard, but you know
the basics—how it works, and how to accomplish a few wondrous things. Of
course, in your setting, “magic” might actually mean psychic powers,
mutant abilities, weird alien tech, or anything else that produces
interesting and useful effects.

An Explorer flavored with magic might be a wizard-hunter, and a Speaker
with magical flavor might be a sorcerer-bard. Although an Adept flavored
with magic is still an Adept, you might find that swapping some of the
type’s basic abilities with those given here tailors the character in
desirable ways.

Combat flavor makes a character more martial. A Speaker with combat
flavor in a fantasy setting would be a battle bard. An Explorer with
combat flavor in a historical game might be a pirate. An Adept flavored
with combat in a science fiction setting could be a veteran of a
thousand psychic wars.

SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE FLAVOR

This flavor is for characters in roles that call for more knowledge and
more real-world application of talent. It’s less flashy and dramatic
than supernatural powers or the ability to hack apart multiple foes, but
sometimes expertise or  
know-how is the real solution to a problem.

A Warrior flavored with skills and knowledge might be a military
engineer. An Explorer flavored with skills and knowledge could be a
field scientist. A Speaker with this flavor might be a teacher.

Descriptor

Your descriptor defines your character—it flavors everything you do. The
differences between a Charming Explorer and a Vicious Explorer are
considerable. The descriptor changes the way those characters go about
every action. Your descriptor places your character in the situation
(the first adventure, which starts the campaign) and helps provide
motivation. It is the adjective of the sentence “I am an *adjective
noun* who *verbs*.”

Descriptors offer a one-time package of extra abilities, skills, or
modifications to your stat Pools. Not all of a descriptor’s offerings
are positive character modifications. For example, some descriptors have
inabilities—tasks that a character isn’t good at. You can think of
inabilities as negative skills—instead of being one step better at that
kind of task, you’re one step worse. If you become skilled at a task
that you have an inability with, they cancel out. Remember that
characters are defined as much by what they’re *not* good at as by what
they *are* good at.

Descriptors also offer a few brief suggestions for how your character
got involved with the rest of the group on their first adventure. You
can use these, or not, as you wish.

This section details fifty descriptors. Choose one of them for your
character. You can pick any descriptor you wish regardless of your type.
At the end of this chapter, a few options are provided for Customizing
Descriptors, including making a character’s species their descriptor.

(Your descriptor matters most when you are a beginning character. The
benefits (and perhaps drawbacks) that come from your descriptor will
eventually be overshadowed by the growing importance of your type and
focus. However, the influence of your descriptor will remain at least
somewhat important throughout your character’s life.)

APPEALING

You’re attractive to others, but perhaps more important, you are
likeable and charismatic. You’ve got that “special something” that draws
others to you. You often know just the right thing to say to make
someone laugh, put them at ease, or spur them to action. People like
you, want to help you, and want to be your friend.

You gain the following characteristics:

Charismatic: +2 to your Intellect Pool.

Skill: You are trained in pleasant social interactions.

Resistant to Charms: You’re aware of how others can manipulate and charm
people, and you notice when those tactics are used on you. Because of
this awareness, you are trained in resisting any kind of persuasion or
seduction if you wish it.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You met a total stranger (one of the other PCs) and charmed them so
much that they invited you along.

2\. The PCs were looking for someone else, but you convinced them that
you were perfect instead.

3\. Pure happenstance—because you just go along with the flow of things
and everything usually works out.

4\. Your charismatic ways helped get one of the PCs out of a difficult
spot a long time ago, and they always ask you to join them on new
adventures.

BENEFICENT

Helping others is your calling. It’s why you’re here. Others delight in
your outgoing and charitable nature, and you delight in their happiness.
You’re at your best when you’re aiding people, either by explaining how
they can best overcome a challenge or by demonstrating how to do so
yourself.

You gain the following characteristics:

Generous: Allies who have spent the last day with you add +1 to their
recovery rolls.

Altruistic: If you’re standing next to a creature that takes damage, you
can intercede and take 1 point of that damage yourself (reducing the
damage inflicted on the creature by 1 point). If you have Armor, it does
not provide a benefit when you use this ability.

Skill: You’re trained in all tasks related to pleasant social
interaction, putting other people at ease, and gaining trust.

Helpful: Whenever you help another character, that character gains the
benefit as if you were trained even if you are not trained or
specialized in the attempted task.

Inability: While you are alone, all Intellect and Speed tasks are
hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. Even though you didn’t know most of the other PCs beforehand, you
invited yourself along on their quest.

2\. You saw the PCs struggling to overcome a problem and selflessly
joined them to help.

3\. You’re nearly certain the PCs will fail without you.

4\. The choice was between your tattered life and helping others. You
haven’t looked back since.

BRASH

You’re a self-assertive sort, confident in your abilities, energetic,
and perhaps a bit irreverent toward ideas that you don’t agree with.
Some people call you bold and brave, but those you’ve put in their place
might call you puffed up and arrogant. Whatever. It’s not in your nature
to care what other people think about you, unless those people are your
friends or family. Even someone as brash as you knows that friends
sometimes have to come first.

You gain the following characteristics:

Energetic: +2 to your Speed Pool.

Skill: You are trained in initiative.

Bold: You are trained in all actions that involve overcoming or ignoring
the effects of fear or intimidation.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You noticed something weird going on, and without much thought, you
jumped in with both feet.

2\. You showed up when and where you did on a dare because, hey, you
don’t back down from dares.

3\. Someone called you out, but instead of walking into a fight, you
walked into your current situation.

4\. You told your friend that nothing could scare you, and nothing you
saw would change your mind. They brought you to your current point.

CALM

You’ve spent most of your life in sedentary pursuits—books, movies,
hobbies, and so on—rather than active ones. You’re well versed in all
manner of academia or other intellectual pursuits, but nothing physical.
You’re not weak or feeble, necessarily (although this is a good
descriptor for characters who are elderly), but you have no experience
in more physical activities.

(Calm is a great descriptor for characters who never intended to have
adventures but were thrust into them, a trope that occurs often in
modern games and particularly in horror games.)

You gain the following characteristics:

Bookish: +2 to your Intellect Pool.

Skills: You are trained in four nonphysical skills of your choice.

Trivia: You can come up with a random fact pertinent to the current
situation when you wish it. This is always a matter of fact, not
conjecture or supposition, and must be something you could have
logically read or seen in the past. You can do this one time, although
the ability is renewed each time you make a recovery roll.

Inability: You’re just not a fighter. All physical attacks are hindered.

Inability: You’re not the outdoorsy type. All climbing, running,
jumping, and swimming tasks are hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You read about the current situation somewhere and decided to check
it out for yourself.

2\. You were in the right (wrong?) place at the right (wrong?) time.

3\. While avoiding an entirely different situation, you walked into your
current situation.

4\. One of the other PCs dragged you into it.

CHAOTIC

Danger doesn’t mean much to you, mainly because you don’t think much
about repercussions. In fact, you enjoy sowing surprises, just to see
what will happen. The more unexpected the result, the happier you are.
Sometimes you are particularly manic, and for the sake of your
companions, you restrain yourself from taking actions that you know will
lead to disaster.

You gain the following characteristics:

Tumultuous: +4 to your Speed Pool.

Skill: You are trained in Intellect defense actions.

Chaotic: Once after each ten-hour recovery roll, if you don’t like the
first result, you can reroll a die roll of your choice. If you do, and
regardless of the outcome, the GM presents you with a GM intrusion.

Inability: Your body is a bit worn from occasional excesses. Might
defense tasks are hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. Another PC recruited you while you were on your best behavior,
before realizing how chaotic you were.

2\. You have reason to believe that being with the other PCs will help
you gain control over your erratic behavior.

3\. Another PC released you from captivity, and to thank them, you
volunteered to help.

4\. You have no idea how you joined the PCs. You’re just going along
with it for now until answers present themselves.

CHARMING

You’re a smooth talker and a charmer. Whether through seemingly
supernatural means or just a way with words, you can convince others to
do as you wish. Most likely, you’re physically attractive or at least
highly charismatic, and others enjoy listening to your voice. You
probably pay attention to your appearance, keeping yourself well
groomed. You make friends easily. You play up the personality facet of
your Intellect stat; intelligence is not your strong suit. You’re
personable, but not necessarily studious or strong-willed.

You gain the following characteristics:

Personable: +2 to your Intellect Pool.

Skill: You’re trained in all tasks involving positive or pleasant social
interaction.

Skill: You’re trained when using special abilities that influence the
minds of others.

Contact: You have an important contact who is in an influential
position, such as a minor noble, the captain of the town guard/police,
or the head of a large gang of thieves. You and the GM should work out
the details together.

Inability: You were never good at studying or retaining facts. Any task
involving lore, knowledge, or understanding is hindered.

Inability: Your willpower is not one of your strong points. Defense
actions to resist mental attacks are hindered.

Additional Equipment: You’ve managed to talk your way into some decent
discounts and bonuses in recent weeks. As a result, you have enough cash
jangling in your pocket to purchase a moderately priced item.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You convinced one of the other PCs to tell you what they were doing.

2\. You instigated the whole thing and convinced the others to join you.

3\. One of the other PCs did a favor for you, and now you’re repaying
that obligation by helping them with the task at hand.

4\. There is a reward involved, and you need the money.

CLEVER

You’re quick-witted, thinking well on your feet. You understand people,
so you can fool them but are rarely fooled. Because you easily see
things for what they are, you get the lay of the land swiftly, size up
threats and allies, and assess situations with accuracy. Perhaps you’re
physically attractive, or maybe you use your wit to overcome any
physical or mental imperfections.

You gain the following characteristics:

Smart: +2 to your Intellect Pool.

Skill: You’re trained in all interactions involving lies or trickery.

Skill: You’re trained in defense rolls to resist mental effects.

Skill: You’re trained in all tasks involving identifying or assessing
danger, lies, quality, importance, function, or power.

Inability: You were never good at studying or retaining trivial
knowledge. Any task involving lore, knowledge, or understanding is
hindered.

Additional Equipment: You see through the schemes of others and
occasionally convince them to believe you—even when, perhaps, they
should not. Thanks to your clever behavior, you have an additional
expensive item.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You convinced one of the other PCs to tell you what they were doing.

2\. From afar, you observed that something interesting was going on.

3\. You talked your way into the situation because you thought it might
earn some money.

4\. You suspect that the other PCs won’t succeed without you.

CLUMSY

Graceless and awkward, you were told that you’d grow out of it, but you
never did. You often drop things, trip over your own feet, or knock
things (or people) over. Some people get frustrated by this quality, but
most find it funny and even a little charming.

(Some players may not want to be defined by a “negative” quality like
Clumsy, but in truth, even this kind of descriptor has enough advantages
that it makes for capable and talented characters. What negative
descriptors really do is make more interesting and complex characters
that are often great fun to play.)

You gain the following characteristics:

Butterfingers: −2 to your Speed Pool.

Thick-Muscled: +2 to your Might Pool.

Inelegant: You have a certain lovable charm. You are trained in all
pleasant social interactions when you express a lighthearted,
self-deprecating manner.

Dumb Luck: The GM can introduce a GM intrusion on you, based on your
clumsiness, without awarding you any XP (as if you had rolled a 1 on a
d20 roll). However, if this happens, 50% of the time, your clumsiness
works to your advantage. Rather than hurting you (much), it helps you,
or it hurts your enemies. You slip, but it’s just in time to duck an
attack. You fall down, but you trip your enemies as you crash into their
legs. You turn around too quickly, but you end up knocking the weapon
from your foe’s hand. You and the GM should work together to determine
the details. If the GM wishes, they can use GM intrusions based on your
clumsiness normally (awarding XP).

Skill: You’ve got a certain bull-like quality. You are trained in tasks
involving breaking things.

Inability: Any task that involves balance, grace, or hand-to-eye
coordination is hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You were in the right place at the right time.

2\. You had a piece of information that the other PCs needed to make
their plans.

3\. A sibling recommended you to the other PCs.

4\. You stumbled into the PCs as they were discussing their mission, and
they took a liking to you.

CRAVEN

Courage fails you at every turn. You lack the willpower and resolve to
stand fast in the face of danger. Fear gnaws at your heart, chewing away
at your mind, driving you to distraction until you cannot bear it. Most
times, you back down from confrontations. You flee from threats and
vacillate when faced with difficult decisions.

Yet for all that fear dogs you and possibly shames you, your cowardly
nature proves to be a useful ally from time to time. Listening to your
fears has helped you escape danger and avoid taking unnecessary risks.
Others may have suffered in your place, and you might be the first to
admit this fact, but secretly you feel intense relief from having
avoided an unthinkable and terrible fate.

(Descriptors like Craven, Cruel, and Dishonorable might not be
appropriate for every group. These are villainous traits and some people
want their PCs to be entirely heroic. But others don’t mind a little
moral greyness thrown into the mix. Still others see things like Craven
and Cruel as traits to overcome as their characters develop (probably
earning them different descriptors).)

You gain the following characteristics:

Furtive: +2 to your Speed Pool.

Skill: You’re trained in stealth-based tasks.

Skill: You’re trained in running actions.

Skill: You’re trained in any action taken to escape danger, flee from a
dangerous situation, or wheedle your way out of trouble.

Inability: You do not willingly enter dangerous situations. Any
initiative actions (to determine who goes first in combat) are hindered.

Inability: You fall to pieces when you have to undertake a potentially
dangerous task alone. Any such task (such as attacking a creature by
yourself) is hindered.

Additional Equipment: You have a good luck charm or protective device to
keep you out of harm’s way.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You believe that you’re being hunted, and you have hired one of the
other PCs as your protector.

2\. You seek to escape your shame and take up with capable individuals
in the hopes of repairing your reputation.

3\. One of the other PCs bullied you into coming along.

4\. The group answered your cries for help when you were in trouble.

CREATIVE

Maybe you have a notebook where you write down ideas so you can develop
them later. Perhaps you email yourself ideas that strike you out of the
blue so you can sort them in an electronic document. Or maybe you just
sit down, stare at your screen and, by indomitable force of will,
produce something from nothing. However your gift works, you’re
creative—you code, write, compose, sculpt, design, direct, or otherwise
create narratives that enthrall other people with your vision.

You gain the following characteristics:

Inventive: +2 to your Intellect Pool.

Original: You’re always coming up with something new. You’re trained in
any task related to creating a narrative (such as a story, play, or
scenario). This includes deception, if the deception involves a
narrative you’re able to tell.

Skill: You are naturally inventive. You are trained in one specific
creative skill of your choice: writing, computer coding, composing
music, painting, drawing, and so on.

Skill: You love solving riddles and the like. You are trained in
puzzle-solving tasks.

Skill: To be creative requires that you always be learning. You are
trained in any task that involves finding out something new, such as
when you’re digging through a library, data bank, news archive, or
similar collection of knowledge.

Inability: You’re inventive but not charming. All tasks related to
pleasant social interaction are hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You were doing research for a project and convinced the PCs to bring
you along.

2\. You’re looking for new markets for the results of your creative
output.

3\. You fell in with the wrong crowd, but they grew on you.

4\. A creative life is often one beset with financial hurdles. You
joined the PCs because you hoped it would be profitable.

CRUEL

Misfortune and suffering do not move you. When another endures hardship,
you find it hard to care, and you may even enjoy the pain and difficulty
the person experiences if they’ve done you wrong in the past. Your cruel
streak may derive from bitterness brought about by your own struggles
and disappointments. You might be a hard pragmatist, doing what you feel
you must even if others are worse for it. Or you could be a sadist,
delighting in the pain you inflict.

Being cruel does not necessarily make you a villain. Your cruelty may be
reserved for those who cross you or other people useful to you. You
might have become cruel as the result of an intensely awful experience.
Abuse and torture, for example, can strip away compassion for other
living beings.

As well, you need not be cruel in every situation. In fact, others might
see you as personable, friendly, and even helpful. But when angered or
frustrated, your dual nature reveals itself, and those who have earned
your scorn are likely to suffer for it.

You gain the following characteristics:

Cunning: +2 to your Intellect Pool.

Cruelty: When you use force, you can choose to maim or deliver painful
injuries to draw out your foe’s suffering. Whenever you inflict damage,
you can choose to inflict 2 fewer points of damage to ease your next
attack against that foe.

Skill: You’re trained in tasks related to deception, intimidation, and
persuasion when you interact with characters experiencing physical or
emotional pain.

Inability: You have a hard time connecting with others, understanding
their motives, or sharing their feelings. Any task to ascertain another
character’s motives, feelings, or disposition is hindered.

Additional Equipment: You have a valuable memento from the last person
you destroyed. The memento is moderately priced, and you can sell it or
trade it for an item of equal or lesser value.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You suspect that you might gain a long-term  
advantage from helping the other PCs and may be able to use that
advantage against your enemies.

2\. By joining the PCs, you see an opportunity to grow your personal
power and status at the expense of others.

3\. You hope to make another PC’s life more difficult by joining the
group.

4\. Joining the PCs gives you an opportunity to escape justice for a
crime you committed.

DISHONORABLE

There is no honor among thieves—or betrayers, backstabbers, liars, or
cheats. You are all of these things, and either you don’t lose any sleep
over it, or you deny the truth to others or to yourself. Regardless, you
are willing to do whatever it takes to get your own way. Honor, ethics,
and principles are merely words. In your estimation, they have no place
in the real world.

You gain the following characteristics:

Sneaky: +4 to your Speed Pool.

Just Desserts: When the GM gives another player an experience point to
award to someone for a GM intrusion, that player cannot give it to you.

Skill: You are trained in deception.

Skill: You are trained in stealth.

Skill: You are trained in intimidation.

Inability: People don’t like or trust you. Pleasant social interactions
are hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You are interested in what the PCs are doing, so you lied to them to
get into their group.

2\. While skulking about, you overheard the PCs’ plans and realized that
you wanted in.

3\. One of the other PCs invited you, having no idea of what you’re
truly like.

4\. You bullied your way in with intimidation and bluster.

DOOMED

You are quite certain that your fate is leading you, inextricably,
toward a terrible end. This fate might be yours alone, or you might be
dragging along the people closest to you.

You gain the following characteristics:

Jumpy: +2 to your Speed Pool.

Skill: Always on the lookout for danger, you are trained in
perception-related tasks.

Skill: You are defense minded, so you are trained in Speed defense
tasks.

Skill: You are cynical and expect the worst. Thus, you are resistant to
mental shocks. You are trained in Intellect defense tasks having to do
with losing your sanity or equanimity.

Doom: Every other time the GM uses GM intrusion on your character, you
cannot refuse it and do not get an XP for it (you still get an XP to
award to another player). This is because you are doomed. The universe
is a cold, uncaring place, and your efforts are futile at best.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You attempted to avoid it, but events seemed to conspire to draw you
to where you are.

2\. Why not? It doesn’t matter. You’re doomed no matter what you do.

3\. One of the other PCs saved your life, and now you’re repaying that
obligation by helping them with the task at hand.

4\. You suspect that the only hope you have of avoiding your fate might
lie on this path.

EMPATHIC

Other people are open books to you. You may have a knack for reading a
person’s tells, those subtle movements that convey an individual’s mood
and disposition. Or you may receive information in a more direct way,
feeling a person’s emotions as if they were tangible things, sensations
that lightly brush against your mind. Your gift for empathy helps you
navigate social situations and control them to avoid misunderstandings
and prevent useless conflicts from erupting.

The constant bombardment of emotions from those around you likely takes
a toll. You might move with the prevailing mood, swinging from giddy
happiness to bitter sorrow with little warning. Or you might close
yourself off and remain inscrutable to others out of a sense of
self-preservation or an unconscious fear that everyone else might learn
how you truly feel.

You gain the following characteristics:

Open Mind: +4 to your Intellect Pool.

Skill: You’re trained in tasks involving sensing other emotions,
discerning dispositions, and getting a hunch about people around you.

Skill: You’re trained in all tasks involving social interaction,
pleasant or otherwise.

Inability: Being so receptive to others’ thoughts and moods makes you
vulnerable to anything that attacks your mind. Intellect defense rolls
are hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You sensed the commitment to the task the other PCs have and felt
moved to help them.

2\. You established a close bond with another PC and can’t bear to be
parted from them.

3\. You sensed something strange in one of the PCs and decided to join
the group to see if you can sense it again and uncover the truth.

4\. You joined the PCs to escape an unpleasant relationship or negative
environment.

EXILED

You have walked a long and lonely road, leaving your home and your life
behind. You might have committed a heinous crime, something so awful
that your people forced you out, and if you dare return, you face death.
You might have been accused of a crime you didn’t commit and now must
pay the price for someone else’s wicked deed. Your exile might be the
result of a social gaffe—perhaps you shamed your family or a friend, or
you embarrassed yourself in front of your peers, an authority, or
someone you respect. Whatever the reason, you have left your old life
behind and now strive to make a new one.

You gain the following characteristics:

Self-Reliant: +2 to your Might Pool.

Loner: You gain no benefit when you get help with a task from another
character who is trained or specialized in that task.

Skill: You’re trained in all tasks involving sneaking.

Skill: You’re trained in all tasks involving foraging, hunting, and
finding safe places to rest or hide.

Inability: Living on your own for as long as you have makes you slow to
trust others and awkward in social situations. Any task involving social
interaction is hindered.

Additional Equipment: You have a memento from your past—an old picture,
a locket with a few strands of hair inside, or a lighter given to you by
someone important. You keep the object close at hand and pull it out to
help you remember better times.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. The other PCs earned your trust by helping you when you needed it.
You accompany them to repay them.

2\. While exploring on your own, you discovered something strange. When
you traveled to a settlement, the PCs were the only ones who believed
you, and they have accompanied you to help you deal with the problem.

3\. One of the other PCs reminds you of someone you used to know.

4\. You have grown weary of your isolation. Joining the other PCs gives
you a chance to belong.

FAST

You’re fleet of foot. Because you’re quick, you can accomplish tasks
more rapidly than others can. You’re not just quick on your feet,
however—you’re quick with your hands, and you think and react quickly.
You even talk quickly.

You gain the following characteristics:

Energetic: +2 to your Speed Pool.

Skill: You are trained in running.

Fast: You can move a short distance and still take another action in the
same round, or you can move a long distance as your action without
needing to make any kind of roll.

Inability: You’re a sprinter, not a long-distance runner. You don’t have
a lot of stamina. Might defense rolls are hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You jumped in to save one of the other PCs who was in dire need.

2\. One of the other PCs recruited you for your unique talents.

3\. You’re impulsive, and it seemed like a good idea at the time.

4\. This mission ties in with a personal goal of your own.

FOOLISH

Not everyone can be brilliant. Oh, you don’t think of yourself as
stupid, and you’re not. It’s just that others might have a bit
more . . . wisdom. Insight. You prefer to barrel along headfirst through
life and let other people worry about things. Worrying’s never helped
you, so why bother? You take things at face value and don’t fret about
what tomorrow might bring.

People call you “idiot” or “numbskull,” but it doesn’t faze you much.

(It can be liberating and really fun to play a foolish character. In
some ways, the pressure to always do the right, smart thing is off. On
the other hand, if you play such a character as a bumbling moron in
every situation, that can become annoying to everyone else at the table.
As with everything, moderation is the key.)

You gain the following characteristics:

Unwise: –4 to your Intellect Pool.

Carefree: You succeed more on luck than anything. Every time you roll
for a task, roll twice and take the higher result.

Intellect Weakness: Any time you spend points from your Intellect Pool,
it costs you 1 more point than usual.

Inability: Any Intellect defense task is hindered.

Inability: Any task that involves seeing through a deception, an
illusion, or a trap is hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. Who knows? Seemed like a good idea at the time.

2\. Someone asked you to join up with the other PCs. They told you not
to ask too many questions, and that seemed fine to you.

3\. Your parent (or a parental/mentor figure) got you involved to give
you something to do and maybe “teach you some sense.”

4\. The other PCs needed some muscle who wouldn’t overthink things.

GRACEFUL

You have a perfect sense of balance, moving and speaking with grace and
beauty. You’re quick, lithe, flexible, and dexterous. Your body is
perfectly suited to dance, and you use that advantage in combat to dodge
blows. You might wear garments that enhance your agile movement and
sense of style.

You gain the following characteristics:

Agile: +2 to your Speed Pool.

Skill: You’re trained in all tasks involving balance and careful
movement.

Skill: You’re trained in all tasks involving physical performing arts.

Skill: You’re trained in all Speed defense tasks.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. Against your better judgment, you joined the other PCs because you
saw that they were in danger.

2\. One of the other PCs convinced you that joining the group would be
in your best interests.

3\. You’re afraid of what might happen if the other PCs fail.

4\. There is reward involved, and you need the money.

GUARDED

You conceal your true nature behind a mask and are loath to let anyone
see who you really are. Protecting yourself, physically and emotionally,
is what you care about most, and you prefer to keep everyone else at a
safe distance. You may be suspicious of everyone you meet, expecting the
worst from people so you won’t be surprised when they prove you right.
Or you might just be a bit reserved, careful about letting people
through your gruff exterior to the person you really are.

No one can be as reserved as you are and make many friends. Most likely,
you have an abrasive personality and tend to be pessimistic in your
outlook. You probably nurse an old hurt and find that the only way you
can cope is to keep it and your personality locked down.

You gain the following characteristics:

Suspicious: +2 to your Intellect Pool.

Skill: You are trained in all Intellect defense tasks.

Skill: You are trained in all tasks involving discerning the truth,
piercing disguises, and recognizing falsehoods and other deceptions.

Inability: Your suspicious nature makes you unlikeable. Any task
involving deception or persuasion is hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. One of the PCs managed to overcome your defenses and befriend you.

2\. You want to see what the PCs are up to, so you accompany them to
catch them in the act of some wrongdoing.

3\. You have made a few enemies and take up with the PCs for protection.

4\. The PCs are the only people who will put up with you.

HARDY

Your body was built to take abuse. Whether you’re pounding down stiff
drinks while holding up a bar in your favorite watering hole or trading
blows with a thug in a back alley, you keep going, shrugging off hurts
and injuries that might slow or incapacitate a lesser person. Neither
hunger nor thirst, cut flesh nor broken bone can stop you. You just
press on through the pain and continue.

As fit and healthy as you are, the signs of wear show in the myriad
scars crisscrossing your body, your thrice-broken nose, your cauliflower
ears, and any number of other disfigurements you wear with pride.

You gain the following characteristics:

Mighty: +4 to your Might Pool.

Fast Healer: You halve the time it takes to make a recovery roll
(minimum one action).

Almost Unstoppable: While you are impaired on the damage track, you
function as if you were hale. While you are debilitated, you function as
if you were impaired. In other words, you don’t suffer the effects of
being impaired until you become debilitated, and you never suffer the
effects of being debilitated. You still die if all your stat Pools are
0.

Skill: You are trained in Might defense actions.

Inability: Your big, strong body is slow to react. Any task involving
initiative is hindered.

Ponderous: When you apply Effort when making a Speed roll, you must
spend 1 extra point from your Speed Pool.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. The PCs recruited you after learning about your reputation as a
survivor.

2\. You joined the PCs because you want or need the money.

3\. The PCs offered you a challenge equal to your physical power.

4\. You believe the only way the PCs will succeed is if you are along to
protect them.

HIDEOUS

You are physically repugnant by almost any human standard. You might
have had a serious accident, a harmful mutation, or just poor genetic
luck, but you are incontrovertibly ugly.

You’ve more than made up for your appearance in other ways, however.
Because you have to hide your appearance, you excel at sneaking about
unnoticed or disguising yourself. But perhaps most important, being
ostracized while others socialized, you took the time growing up to
develop yourself as you saw fit—you grew strong or quick, or you honed
your mind.

You gain the following characteristics:

Versatile: You get 4 additional points to divide among your stat Pools.

Skill: You are trained in intimidation and any other fear-based
interactions, if you show your true face.

Skill: You are trained in disguise and stealth tasks.

Inability: All tasks relating to pleasant social interaction are
hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. One of the other PCs approached you while you were in disguise,
recruiting you while believing you were someone else.

2\. While skulking about, you overheard the other PCs’ plans and
realized you wanted in.

3\. One of the other PCs invited you, but you wonder if it was out of
pity.

4\. You bullied your way in with intimidation and bluster.

HONORABLE

You are trustworthy, fair, and forthright. You try to do what is right,
to help others, and to treat them well. Lying and cheating are no way to
get ahead—these things are for the weak, the lazy, or the despicable.
You probably spend a lot of time thinking about your personal honor, how
best to maintain it, and how to defend it if challenged. In combat, you
are straightforward and offer quarter to any foe.

You were likely instilled with this sense of honor by a parent or a
mentor. Sometimes the distinction between what is and isn’t honorable
varies with different schools of thought, but in broad strokes,
honorable people can agree on most aspects of what honor means.

You gain the following characteristics:

Stalwart: +2 to your Might Pool.

Skill: You are trained in pleasant social interactions.

Skill: You are trained in discerning people’s true motives or seeing
through lies.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. The PCs’ goals appear to be honorable and commendable.

2\. You see that what the other PCs are about to do is dangerous, and
you’d like to help protect them.

3\. One of the other PCs invited you, hearing of your trustworthiness.

4\. You asked politely if you could join the other PCs in their mission.

IMPULSIVE

You have a hard time tamping down your enthusiasm. Why wait when you can
just do it (whatever it is) and get it done? You deal with problems when
they arise rather than plan ahead. Putting out the small fires now
prevents them from becoming one big fire later. You are the first to
take risks, to jump in and lend a hand, to step into dark passages, and
to find danger.

Your impulsiveness likely gets you into trouble. While others might take
time to study the items they discover, you use such items without
hesitation. After all, the best way to learn what something can do is to
use it. When a cautious explorer might look around and check for danger
nearby, you have to physically stop yourself from bulling on ahead. Why
fuss around when the exciting thing is just ahead?

(Impulsive characters get into trouble. That’s their thing, and that’s
fine. But if you’re constantly dragging your fellow PCs into trouble (or
worse, getting them seriously hurt or killed), that will be annoying, to
say the least. A good rule of thumb is that impulsiveness doesn’t always
mean a predilection for doing the wrong thing. Sometimes it’s the urge
to do the right thing.)

You gain the following characteristics:

Reckless: +2 to your Speed Pool.

Skill: You’re trained in initiative actions (to determine who goes first
in combat).

Skill: You’re trained in Speed defense actions.

Inability: You’ll try anything once, but quickly grow bored after that.
Any task that involves patience, willpower, or discipline is hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You heard what the other PCs were up to and suddenly decided to join
them.

2\. You pulled everyone together after you heard rumors about something
interesting you want to see or do.

3\. You blew all of your money and now find yourself strapped for cash.

4\. You’re in trouble for acting recklessly. You join the other PCs
because they offer a way out of your problem.

INQUISITIVE

The world is vast and mysterious, with wonders and secrets to keep you
amazed for several lifetimes. You feel the tugging on your heart, the
call to explore the wreckage of past civilizations, to discover new
peoples, new places, and whatever bizarre wonders you might find along
the way. However, as strongly as you feel the pull to roam the world,
you know there is danger aplenty, and you take precautions to ensure
that you are prepared for any eventuality. Research, preparation, and
readiness will help you live long enough to see everything you want to
see and do everything you want to do.

You probably have a dozen books and travelogues about the world on you
at any time. When not hitting the road and looking around, you spend
your time with your nose in a book, learning everything you can about
the place you’re going so you know what to expect when you get there.

You gain the following characteristics:

Smart: +4 to your Intellect Pool.

Skill: You are eager to learn. You are trained in any task that involves
learning something new, whether you’re talking to a local to get
information or digging through old books to find lore.

Skill: You have made a study of the world. You are trained in any task
involving geography or history.

Inability: You tend to fixate on the details, making you somewhat
oblivious to what’s going on around you. Any task to hear or notice
dangers around you is hindered.

Inability: When you see something interesting, you hesitate as you take
in all the details. Initiative actions (to determine who goes first in
combat) are hindered.

Additional Equipment: You have three books on whatever subjects you
choose.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. One of the PCs approached you to learn information related to the
mission, having heard you were an expert.

2\. You have always wanted to see the place where the other PCs are
going.

3\. You were interested in what the other PCs were up to and decided to
go along with them.

4\. One of the PCs fascinates you, perhaps due to a special or weird
ability they have.

INTELLIGENT

You’re quite smart. Your memory is sharp, and you easily grasp concepts
that others might struggle with. This aptitude doesn’t necessarily mean
that you’ve had years of formal education, but you have learned a great
deal in your life, primarily because you pick things up quickly and
retain so much.

You gain the following characteristics:

Smart: +2 to your Intellect Pool.

Skill: You’re trained in an area of knowledge of your choice.

Skill: You’re trained in all actions that involve remembering or
memorizing things you experience directly. For example, instead of being
good at recalling details of geography that you read about in a book,
you can remember a path through a set of tunnels that you’ve explored
before.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. One of the other PCs asked your opinion of the mission, knowing that
if you thought it was a good idea, it probably was.

2\. You saw value in what the other PCs were doing.

3\. You believed that the task might lead to important and interesting
discoveries.

4\. A colleague requested that you take part in the mission as a favor.

INTUITIVE

You are often tickled by a sense of knowing what someone will say, how
they will react, or how events might unfold. Maybe you have a mutant
sense, maybe you can see just a few moments ahead through time, or maybe
you’re just good at reading people and extrapolating a situation.
Whatever the case, many who look into your eyes immediately glance away,
as if afraid of what you might see in their expression.

You gain the following characteristics:

Innate: +2 to your Intellect Pool.

Skill: You are trained in perception tasks.

Know What to Do: You can act immediately, even if it’s not your turn.
Afterward, on your next regular turn, any action you take is hindered.
You can do this one time, although the ability is renewed each time you
make a recovery roll.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You just knew you had to come along.

2\. You convinced one of the other PCs that your intuition is
invaluable.

3\. You felt that something terrible would happen if you didn’t go.

4\. You’re confident the reason you arrived at this point will soon
become clear.

JOVIAL

You’re cheerful, friendly, and outgoing. You put others at ease with a
big smile and a joke, possibly one at your own expense, though lightly
ribbing your companions who can take it is also one of your favorite
pastimes. Sometimes people say you never take anything seriously. That’s
not true, of course, but you have learned that to dwell on the bad too
long quickly robs the world of joy. You’ve always got a new joke in your
back pocket because you collect them like some people collect bottles of
wine.

You gain the following characteristics:

Witty: +2 to your Intellect Pool.

Skill: You’re convivial and set most people at ease with your attitude.
You are trained in all tasks related to pleasant social interaction.

Skill: You have an advantage in figuring out the punch lines of jokes
you’ve never heard before. You are trained in all tasks related to
solving puzzles and riddles.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You solved a riddle before realizing that answering it would launch
you into the adventure.

2\. The other PCs thought you’d bring some much-needed levity to the
team.

3\. You decided that all fun and no work was not the best way to get
through life, so you joined up with the PCs.

4\. It was either go with the PCs or face up to a circumstance that was
anything but jovial.

KIND

It’s always been easy for you to see things from the point of view of
other people. That ability has made you sympathetic to what they really
want or need. From your perspective, you’re just applying the old
proverb that “it’s easier to catch flies with honey than with vinegar,”
but others simply see your behavior as kindness. Of course, being kind
takes time, and yours is limited. You’ve learned that a small fraction
of people don’t deserve your time or kindness—true sadists, narcissists,
and similar folk will only waste your energy. So you deal with them
swiftly, saving your kindness for those who deserve it and can benefit
from your attention.

You gain the following characteristics:

Emotionally Intuitive: +2 to your Intellect Pool.

Skill: You know what it’s like to go a mile in someone else’s shoes.
You’re trained in all tasks related to pleasant social interaction and
discerning the dispositions of others.

Karma: Sometimes, strangers just help you out. To gain the aid of a
stranger, you must use a one action, ten-minute, or one-hour recovery
roll (without gaining its healing benefit), and the GM determines the
nature of the aid you gain. Usually, the act of kindness isn’t enough to
turn a bad situation completely around, but it may moderate a bad
situation and lead to new opportunities. For example, if you are
captured, a guard loosens your bonds slightly, brings you water, or
delivers a message.

Inability: Being kind comes with a few risks. All tasks related to
detecting falsehoods are hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. A PC needed your help, and you agreed to come along as a kindness.

2\. You gave the wrong person access to your money, and now you need to
make some back.

3\. You’re ready to take your benevolence on the road and help more
people than you could if you didn’t join the PCs.

4\. Your job, which seemed like it would be personally rewarding, is the
opposite. You join the PCs to escape the drudgery.

LEARNED

You have studied, either on your own or with an instructor. You know
many things and are an expert on a few topics, such as history, biology,
geography, mythology, nature, or any other area of study. Learned
characters typically carry a few books around with them and spend their
spare time reading.

You gain the following characteristics:

Smart: +2 to your Intellect Pool.

Skill: You’re trained in three areas of knowledge of your choice.

Inability: You have few social graces. Any task involving charm,
persuasion, or etiquette is hindered.

Additional Equipment: You have two additional books on topics of your
choice.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. One of the other PCs asked you to come along because of your
knowledge.

2\. You need money to fund your studies.

3\. You believed that the task might lead to important and interesting
discoveries.

4\. A colleague requested that you take part in the mission as a favor.

LUCKY

You rely on chance and timely good luck to get you through many
situations. When people say that someone was born under a lucky star,
they mean you. When you try your hand at something new, no matter how
unfamiliar the task is, as often as not you find a measure of success.
Even when disaster strikes, it’s rarely as bad as it could be. More
often, small things seem to go your way, you win contests, and you’re
often in the right place at the right time.

You gain the following characteristics:

Luck Pool: You have one additional Pool called Luck that begins with 3
points, and it has a maximum value of 3 points. When spending points
from any other Pool, you can take one, some, or all of the points from
your Luck Pool first. When you make a recovery roll to recover points to
any other Pool, your Luck Pool is also refreshed by the same number of
points. When your Luck Pool is at 0 points, it does not count against
your damage track. Enabler.

Advantage: When you use 1 XP to reroll a d20 for any roll that affects
only you, add 3 to the reroll.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. Knowing that lucky people notice and take active advantage of
opportunities, you became involved in your first adventure by choice.

2\. You literally bumped into someone else on this adventure through
sheer luck.

3\. You found a briefcase lying alongside the road. It was battered, but
inside you found a lot of strange documents that led you here.

4\. Your luck saved you when you avoided a speeding vehicle by a
fortuitous fall through an opening in the ground (a manhole, if in a
modern setting). Beneath the ground, you found something you couldn’t
ignore.

MAD

You have delved too deeply into subjects people were not meant to know.
You are knowledgeable in things beyond the scope of most, but this
knowledge has come at a terrible price. You are likely in questionable
physical shape and occasionally shake with nervous tics. You sometimes
mutter to yourself without realizing it.

You gain the following characteristics:

Knowledgeable: +4 to your Intellect Pool.

Fits of Insight: Whenever such knowledge is appropriate, the GM feeds
you information although there is no clear explanation as to how you
could know such a thing. This is up to the GM’s discretion, but it
should happen as often as once each session.

Erratic Behavior: You are prone to acting erratically or irrationally.
When you are in the presence of a major discovery or subjected to great
stress (such as a serious physical threat), the GM can introduce a GM
intrusion that directs your next action without awarding XP. You can
still pay 1 XP to refuse the intrusion. The GM’s influence is the
manifestation of your madness and thus is always something you would not
likely do otherwise, but it is not directly, obviously harmful to you
unless there are extenuating circumstances. (For example, if a foe
suddenly leaps out of the darkness, you might spend the first round
babbling incoherently or screaming the name of your first true love.)

Skill: You are trained in one area of knowledge (probably something
weird or esoteric).

Inability: Your mind is quite fragile. Tasks to resist mental attacks
are hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. Voices in your head told you to go.

2\. You instigated the whole thing and convinced the others to join you.

3\. One of the other PCs obtained a book of knowledge for you, and now
you’re repaying that favor by helping them with the task at hand.

4\. You feel compelled by inexplicable intuition.

MECHANICAL

You have a special talent with machines of all kinds, and you’re adept
at understanding and, if need be, repairing them. Perhaps you’re a bit
of an inventor, creating new machines from time to time. You get called
“techie,” “tech,” “mech,” “gear-head,” “motor-head,” or any of a number
of other nicknames. Mechanics usually wear practical work clothes and
carry around a lot of tools.

You gain the following characteristics:

Smart: +2 to your Intellect Pool.

Skill: You’re trained in all actions involving identifying or
understanding machines.

Skill: You’re trained in all actions involving using, repairing, or
crafting machines.

Additional Equipment: You start with a variety of machine tools.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. While repairing a nearby machine, you overheard the other PCs
talking.

2\. You need money to buy tools and parts.

3\. It was clear that the mission couldn’t succeed without your skills
and knowledge.

4\. Another PC asked you to join them.

MYSTERIOUS

The dark figure lurking silently in the corner? That’s you. No one
really knows where you came from or what your motives are—you play
things close to the vest. Your manner perplexes and confounds others,
but that doesn’t make you a poor friend or ally. You’re just good at
keeping things to yourself, moving about unseen, and concealing your
presence and identity.

You gain the following characteristics:

Skill: You are trained in all stealth tasks.

Skill: You are trained in resisting interrogation or tricks to get you
to talk.

Confounding: You pull talents and abilities seemingly out of nowhere.
You can attempt one task in which you have no training as if you were
trained, attempt a task that you are trained in as if specialized, or
gain a free level of Effort with a task that you are specialized in.
This ability refreshes every time you make a recovery roll, but the uses
never accumulate.

Inability: People never know where they stand with you. Any task
involving getting people to believe or trust you is hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You just showed up one day.

2\. You convinced one of the other PCs that you had invaluable skills.

3\. Some equally mysterious figure told you where to be and when (but
not why) to join the group.

4\. Something—a feeling, a dream—told you where to be and when to join
the group.

MYSTICAL

You think of yourself as mystical, attuned with the mysterious and the
paranormal. Your true talents lie with the supernatural. You likely have
experience with ancient lore, and you can sense and wield the
supernatural—though whether that means “magic,” “psychic phenomena,” or
something else is up to you (and probably up to those around you as
well). Mystical characters often wear jewelry, such as a ring or an
amulet, or have tattoos or other marks that show their interests.

You gain the following characteristics:

Smart: +2 to your Intellect Pool.

Skill: You’re trained in all actions involving identifying or
understanding the supernatural.

Sense Magic: You can sense whether the supernatural is active in
situations where its presence is not obvious. You must study an object
or location closely for a minute to get a feel for whether a mystical
touch is at work.

Spell: You can perform Hedge Magic as a spell when you have a free hand
and can pay the Intellect point cost.

Inability: You have a manner or an aura that others find a bit
unnerving. Any task involving charm, persuasion, or deception is
hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. A dream guided you to this point.

2\. You need money to fund your studies.

3\. You believed the mission would be a great way to learn more about
the supernatural.

4\. Various signs and portents led you here.

NAIVE

You’ve lived a sheltered life. Your childhood was safe and secure, so
you didn’t get a chance to learn much about the world—and even less
chance to experience it. Whether you were training for something, had
your nose in a book, or just were sequestered in a secluded place, you
haven’t done much, met many people, or seen many interesting things so
far. That’s probably going to change soon, but as you go forward into a
larger world, you do so without some of the understanding that others
possess about how it all works.

You gain the following characteristics:

Fresh: You add +1 to your recovery rolls.

Incorruptible: You are trained in Intellect defense tasks and all tasks
that involve resisting temptation.

Skill: You’re wide-eyed. You are trained in perception tasks.

Inability: Any task that involves seeing through deceptions or
determining someone’s secret motive is hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. Someone told you that you should get involved.

2\. You needed money, and this seemed like a good way to earn some.

3\. You believed that you could learn a lot by joining the other PCs.

4\. Sounded like fun.

PERCEPTIVE

You miss little. You pick out the small details in the world around you
and are skilled at making deductions from the information you find. Your
talents make you an exceptional sleuth, a formidable scientist, or a
talented scout.

As adept as you are at finding clues, you have no skill at picking up on
social cues. You overlook an offense that your deductions give or how
uncomfortable your scrutiny can make the people around you. You tend to
dismiss others as being intellectual dwarfs compared to you, which
avails you little when you need a favor.

You gain the following characteristics:

Smart: +2 to your Intellect Pool.

Skill: You have an eye for detail. You are trained in any task that
involves finding or noticing small details.

Skill: You know a little about everything. You are trained in any task
that involves identifying objects or calling to mind a minor detail or
bit of trivia.

Skill: Your skill at making deductions can be imposing. You are trained
in any task that involves intimidating another creature.

Inability: Your confidence comes off as arrogance to people who don’t
know you. Any task involving positive social interactions is hindered.

Additional Equipment: You have a bag of light tools.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You overheard the other PCs discussing their mission and volunteered
your services.

2\. One of the PCs asked you to come along, believing that your talents
would be invaluable to the mission.

3\. You believe that the PCs’ mission is somehow related to one of your
investigations.

4\. A third party recruited you to follow the PCs and see what they were
up to.

RESILIENT

You can take a lot of punishment, both physically and mentally, and
still come back for more. It takes a lot to put you down. Neither
physical nor mental shocks or damage have a lasting effect. You’re tough
to faze. Unflappable. Unstoppable.

You gain the following characteristics:

Resistant: +2 to your Might Pool, and +2 to your Intellect Pool.

Recover: You can make an extra recovery roll each day. This roll is just
one action. So you can make two recovery rolls that each take one
action, one roll that takes ten minutes, a fourth roll that takes one
hour, and a fifth roll that requires ten hours of rest.

Skill: You are trained in Might defense tasks.

Skill: You are trained in Intellect defense tasks.

Inability: You’re hardy but not necessarily strong. Any task involving
moving, bending, or breaking things is hindered.

Inability: You have a lot of willpower and mental fortitude, but you’re
not necessarily smart. Any task involving knowledge or figuring out
problems or puzzles is hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You saw that the PCs clearly need someone like you to help them out.

2\. Someone asked you to watch over one of the PCs in particular, and
you agreed.

3\. You are bored and desperately in need of a challenge.

4\. You lost a bet—unfairly, you think—and had to take someone’s place
on this mission.

RISK-TAKING

It’s part of your nature to question what others think can’t or
shouldn’t be done. You’re not insane, of course—you wouldn’t attempt to
leap across a mile-wide chasm just because you were dared. There’s
impossible and then there’s the just barely possible. You like to push
the latter further than others, because it gives you a rush of
satisfaction and pleasure when you succeed. The more you succeed, the
more you find yourself looking for that next risky challenge to try
yourself against.

You gain the following characteristics:

Nimble: +4 to your Speed Pool.

Skill: You’re adept at leveraging risk, and you are trained in tasks
that involve some element of chance, such as playing games or choosing
between two or three apparently equal options.

Pressing Your Luck: You can choose to automatically succeed on one task
without rolling, as long as the task’s difficulty is no higher than 6.
When you do so, however, you also trigger a GM intrusion as if you had
rolled a 1. The intrusion doesn’t invalidate the success, but it
probably qualifies it in some fashion. You can do this one time,
although the ability renews each time you make a ten-hour recovery roll.

Inability: You may be nimble, but you’re not sneaky. Tasks related to
sneaking and staying quiet are hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. It seemed like there were equal odds that the other PCs wouldn’t
succeed, which sounded good to you.

2\. You think the tasks ahead will present you with unique and
fulfilling challenges.

3\. One of your biggest risks failed to go your way, and you need money
to help pay that debt.

4\. You bragged that you never saw a risk you didn’t like, which is how
you reached your current point.

RUGGED

You’re a nature lover accustomed to living rough, pitting your wits
against the elements. Most likely, you’re a skilled hunter, gatherer, or
naturalist. Years of living in the wild have left their mark with a worn
countenance, wild hair, or scars. Your clothing is probably much less
refined than the garments worn by city dwellers.

You gain the following characteristics:

Skill: You’re trained in all tasks involving climbing, jumping, running,
and swimming.

Skill: You’re trained in all tasks involving training, riding, or
placating natural animals.

Skill: You’re trained in all tasks involving identifying or using
natural plants.

Inability: You have no social graces and prefer animals to people. Any
task involving charm, persuasion, etiquette, or deception is hindered.

Additional Equipment: You carry an explorer’s pack with rope, two days’
rations, a bedroll, and other tools needed for outdoor survival.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. Against your better judgment, you joined the other PCs because you
saw that they were in danger.

2\. One of the other PCs convinced you that joining the group would be
in your best interests.

3\. You’re afraid of what might happen if the other PCs fail.

4\. There is reward involved, and you need the money.

SHARP-EYED

You’re perceptive and well aware of your surroundings. You notice the
little details and remember them. You can be difficult to surprise.

You gain the following characteristics:

Skill: You’re trained in initiative actions.

Skill: You’re trained in perception actions.

Find the Flaw: If an opponent has a straightforward weakness (takes
extra damage from fire, can’t see out of their left eye, and so on), the
GM will tell you what it is.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You heard about what was going on, saw a flaw in the other PCs’
plan, and joined up to help them out.

2\. You noticed that the PCs have a foe (or at least a tail) they
weren’t aware of.

3\. You saw that the other PCs were up to something interesting and got
involved.

4\. You’ve been noticing some strange things going on, and this all
appears related.

SKEPTICAL

You possess a questioning attitude regarding claims that are often taken
for granted by others. You’re not necessarily a “doubting Thomas” (a
skeptic who refuses to believe anything without direct personal
experience), but you’ve often benefited from questioning the statements,
opinions, and received knowledge presented to you by others.

You gain the following characteristics:

Insightful: +2 to your Intellect Pool.

Skill: You’re trained in identifying.

Skill: You’re trained in all actions that involve seeing through a
trick, an illusion, a rhetorical ruse designed to evade the issue, or a
lie. For example, you’re better at keeping your eye on the cup
containing the hidden ball, sensing an illusion, or realizing if someone
is lying to you (but only if you specifically concentrate and use this
skill).

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You overheard other PCs holding forth on a topic with an opinion you
were quite skeptical about, so you decided to approach the group and ask
for proof.

2\. You were following one of the other PCs because you were suspicious
of him, which brought you into the action.

3\. Your theory about the nonexistence of the supernatural can be
invalidated only by your own senses, so you came along.

4\. You need money to fund your research.

STEALTHY

You’re sneaky, slippery, and fast. These talents help you hide, move
quietly, and pull off tricks that require sleight of hand. Most likely,
you’re wiry and small. However, you’re not much of a sprinter—you’re
more dexterous than fleet of foot.

You gain the following characteristics:

Quick: +2 to your Speed Pool.

Skill: You’re trained in all stealth tasks.

Skill: You’re trained in all interactions involving lies or trickery.

Skill: You’re trained in all special abilities involving illusions or
trickery.

Inability: You’re sneaky but not fast. All movement-related tasks are
hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You attempted to steal from one of the other PCs. That character
caught you and forced you to come along with them.

2\. You were tailing one of the other PCs for reasons of your own, which
brought you into the action.

3\. An NPC employer secretly paid you to get involved.

4\. You overheard the other PCs talking about a topic that interested
you, so you decided to approach the group.

STRONG

You’re extremely strong and physically powerful, and you use these
qualities well, whether through violence or feats of prowess. You likely
have a brawny build and impressive muscles.

You gain the following characteristics:

Very Powerful: +4 to your Might Pool.

Skill: You’re trained in all actions involving breaking inanimate
objects.

Skill: You’re trained in all jumping actions.

Additional Equipment: You have an extra medium weapon or heavy weapon.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. Against your better judgment, you joined the other PCs because you
saw that they were in danger.

2\. One of the other PCs convinced you that joining the group would be
in your best interests.

3\. You’re afraid of what might happen if the other PCs fail.

4\. There is reward involved, and you need the money.

STRONG-WILLED

You’re tough-minded, willful, and independent. No one can talk you into
anything or change your mind when you don’t want it changed. This
quality doesn’t necessarily make you smart, but it does make you a
bastion of willpower and resolve. You likely dress and act with unique
style and flair, not caring what others think.

You gain the following characteristics:

Willful: +4 to your Intellect Pool.

Skill: You’re trained in resisting mental effects.

Skill: You’re trained in tasks requiring incredible focus or
concentration.

Inability: Willful doesn’t mean brilliant. Any task that involves
figuring out puzzles or problems, memorizing things, or using lore is
hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. Against your better judgment, you joined the other PCs because you
saw that they were in danger.

2\. One of the other PCs convinced you that joining the group would be
in your best interests.

3\. You’re afraid of what might happen if the other PCs fail.

4\. There is reward involved, and you need the money.

SWIFT

You move quickly, able to sprint in short bursts and work with your
hands with dexterity. You’re great at crossing distances quickly but not
always smoothly. You are likely slim and muscular.

You gain the following characteristics:

Fast: +4 to your Speed Pool.

Skill: You’re trained in initiative actions (to determine who goes first
in combat).

Skill: You’re trained in running actions.

Inability: You’re fast but not necessarily graceful. Any task involving
balance is hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. Against your better judgment, you joined the other PCs because you
saw that they were in danger.

2\. One of the other PCs convinced you that joining the group would be
in your best interests.

3\. You’re afraid of what might happen if the other PCs fail.

4\. There is reward involved, and you need the money.

TONGUE-TIED

You’ve never been much of a talker. When forced to interact with others,
you never think of the right thing to say—words fail you entirely, or
they come out all wrong. You often end up saying precisely the wrong
thing and insult someone unintentionally. Most of the time, you just
keep mum. This makes you a listener instead—a careful observer. It also
means that you’re better at doing things than talking about them. You’re
quick to take action.

You gain the following characteristics:

Actions, Not Words: +2 to your Might Pool, and +2 to your Speed Pool.

Skill: You are trained in perception.

Skill: You are trained in initiative (unless it’s a social situation).

Inability: All tasks relating to social interaction are hindered.

Inability: All tasks involving verbal communication or relaying
information are hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You just tagged along and no one told you to leave.

2\. You saw something important the other PCs did not and (with some
effort) managed to relate it to them.

3\. You intervened to save one of the other PCs when they were in
danger.

4\. One of the other PCs recruited you for your talents.

TOUGH

You’re strong and can take a lot of physical punishment. You might have
a large frame and a square jaw. Tough characters frequently have visible
scars.

You gain the following characteristics:

Resilient: +1 to Armor.

Healthy: Add 1 to the points you regain when you make a recovery roll.

Skill: You’re trained in Might defense actions.

Additional Equipment: You have an extra light weapon.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You’re acting as a bodyguard for one of the other PCs.

2\. One of the PCs is your sibling, and you came along to watch out for
them.

3\. You need money because your family is in debt.

4\. You stepped in to defend one of the PCs when that character was
threatened. While talking to them afterward, you heard about the group’s
task.

VICIOUS

You try to hide what’s inside, fold it into yourself when everything
inside you screams to let go, make them pay, make them hurt, and make
them bleed. Sometimes you succeed for your friends—smiling like they
smile, laughing when they laugh, and sometimes even having other
emotions of your own. But it’s always there, that feeling of frantic
glee mixed with hate that sometimes leaps out of you when you confront a
foe. Violence your friends can tolerate, but you sometimes worry they
will also learn that you are cruel.

You gain the following characteristics:

Skill: You are trained in tracking creatures. If a creature has wronged
you, the tracking task is eased.

Bloodthirsty: Once you begin fighting, you see only red. You inflict 2
additional points of damage with any attack.

Berserk: Once you begin fighting, it’s hard for you to stop. In fact,
it’s a difficulty 2 Intellect task to do so, even if your foe surrenders
or you’ve run out of foes. If the latter occurs and you fail to stop,
you attack the nearest ally within short range.

Additional Equipment: You have a record that you use to list those
who’ve wronged you.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. Another PC saw you take down a mean drunk in a tavern, not realizing
you were the one who started the fight.

2\. You wanted to get away from a bad situation, so you went with the
other PCs.

3\. You want to change, and you hope that being with the other PCs will
help you calm yourself.

4\. One of the other PCs asked you to come along, believing that your
viciousness could be harnessed for the benefit of the mission.

VIRTUOUS

Doing the right thing is a way of life. You live by a code, and that
code is something you attend to every day. Whenever you slip, you
reproach yourself for your weakness and then get right back on track.
Your code probably includes moderation, respect for others, cleanliness,
and other characteristics that most people would agree are virtues,
while you eschew their opposites: sloth, greed, gluttony, and so on.

You gain the following characteristics:

Dauntless: +2 to your Might Pool.

Skill: You are trained in discerning people’s true motives or seeing
through lies.

Skill: Your adherence to a strict moral code has hardened your mind
against fear, doubt, and outside influence. You are trained in Intellect
defense tasks.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. The PCs are doing something virtuous, and you’re all about that.

2\. The PCs are on the road to perdition, and you see it as your task to
set them on the proper moral route.

3\. One of the other PCs invited you, hearing of your virtuous ways.

4\. You put virtue before sense and defended someone’s honor in the face
of an organization or power far greater than you. You joined the PCs
because they offered aid and friendship when, out of fear of reprisals,
no one else would.

WEIRD

You aren’t like anyone else, and that’s fine with you. People don’t seem
to understand you—they even seem put off by you—but who cares? You
understand the world better than they do because you’re weird, and so is
the world you live in. The concept of “the weird” is well known to you.
Strange devices, ancient locales, bizarre creatures, storms that can
transform you, living energy fields, conspiracies, aliens, and things
most people can’t even name populate the world, and you thrive on them.
You have a special attachment to it all, and the more you discover about
the weirdness in the world, the more you might discover about yourself.

Weird characters might be mutants or people born with strange qualities,
but sometimes they started out “normal” and adopted the weird by choice.

You gain the following characteristics:

Inner Light: +2 to your Intellect Pool.

Distinctive Physical Quirk: You have a unique physical aspect that is,
well, bizarre. Depending on the setting, this can vary greatly. You
might have purple hair or metal spikes on your head. Perhaps your hands
don’t connect to your arms, although they move as if they do. Maybe a
third eye stares out from the side of your head, or superfluous tendrils
grow from your back. Whatever it is, your quirk might be a mutation, a
supernatural trait (a blessing or curse), a feature with no explanation,
or just a really wild tattoo that draws a lot of attention.

A Sense for the Weird: Sometimes—at the GM’s discretion—weird things
relating to the supernatural or its effects on the world seem to call
out to you. You can sense them from afar, and if you get within long
range of such a thing, you can sense whether it is overtly dangerous or
not.

Skill: You are trained in supernatural knowledge.

Inability: People find you unnerving. All tasks relating to pleasant
social interaction are hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. It seemed weird, so why not?

2\. Whether the other PCs realize it or not, their mission has to do
with something weird that you know about, so you got involved.

3\. As an expert in the weird, you were specifically recruited by the
other PCs.

4\. You felt drawn to join the other PCs, but you don’t know why.

CUSTOMIZING DESCRIPTORS

Under the normal rules, each descriptor is based on some modification of
the following guidelines:

Some descriptors offer +4 to one stat Pool and either two narrow skills
or one broad skill.

Other descriptors offer +2 to one stat Pool and either three narrow
skills or one narrow skill and one broad skill.

A broad skill covers many areas (such as all interactions). A narrow
skill covers fewer areas (such as deceptive interactions).
Combat-related skills, such as defense or initiative, are considered
broad skills in this sense.

Regardless, you can add an additional skill if it is balanced by an
inability.

You can add other non-skill abilities by eyeballing them and trying to
equate them to the value of a skill, if possible. If the descriptor
seems lacking, add a moderately priced item as additional equipment to
balance things out.

With this general information, you can customize a descriptor, but keep
in mind that a heavily customized descriptor isn’t a descriptor if it no
longer says one thing about a character. It’s better to use this
information to create a new descriptor that fits exactly how the player
wants to portray the character.

SPECIES AS DESCRIPTOR

Sometimes, in settings that have alien or fantasy species, players want
to play a member of that species rather than the default (which is
usually “human”). Most of the time, this choice is one of flavor rather
than game mechanics. If you’re a 7-foot-tall furry Rigellian with three
eyes, that’s great, but it doesn’t change your stats or skills (though
it may have roleplaying challenges).

However, sometimes being a nonhuman results in more substantive changes.
A PC ogre in a fantasy setting might have the Strong or Tough
descriptor, or perhaps it has a descriptor simply called Ogre, which is
similar to Strong or Tough but more pronounced (with greater Might but
even greater drawbacks). This would mean that instead of being a Tough
Warrior who Controls Beasts, the character is an Ogre Warrior who
Controls Beasts.

The Genre chapter offers a few species descriptors, but many GMs will
want to create their own as suits their setting. It can’t be stressed
enough, however, that nine times out of ten, in most genres, species
differences aren’t significant enough to warrant this treatment. The
differences between a Mysterious character and a Virtuous one are
probably greater than those between an Alpha Centauran and an Earthling.

Focus

Focus is what makes a character unique. No two PCs in a group should
have the same focus. A focus gives a character benefits when they create
their character and each time they ascend to the next tier. It’s the
verb of the sentence “I am an *adjective noun* who *verbs*.”

This chapter contains nearly a hundred sample foci, such as Bears a Halo
of Fire, Would Rather Be Reading, and Pilots Starcraft. These foci can
be chosen and used as presented by a player, or by the GM who adds them
to a list of available foci for their players in their next campaign.

In addition, the latter half of this chapter provides tools for the GM
or an enterprising player to create their own custom foci that perfectly
match the needs of a given game or campaign, as presented in Creating
New Foci.

CHOOSING FOCI

Not all foci are appropriate for every genre. The Genre chapter provides
guidance, but this section offers some broad generalizations. Obviously,
the GM can include whatever foci are available in their setting. Foci
end up being an important distinction in this case, because Commands
Mental Powers, for example, makes it clear that psychic abilities exist
in the setting, just as Howls at the Moon implies the existence of
lycanthropes like werewolves, and Pilots Starcraft, of course, requires
starships available to pilot.

When a focus is chosen for a character, they get a special connection to
one or more of their fellow PCs, a first-tier ability, and perhaps
additional starting equipment: one or two pieces of equipment that might
be required for the character to use their ability, or that might pair
well with the focus. For instance, a character that can build things
needs a set of tools. A character that’s constantly on fire needs a set
of clothes that are immune to flame. A character that draws runes to
cast spells needs writing implements. A character that slays monsters
with a sword needs a sword. And so on. That said, many foci don’t
require additional equipment.

Each focus also offers one or more suggestions—GM intrusions—for
possible effects or consequences of really good or really bad die rolls.

A couple of foci presented in this chapter provide a “type swap option”
that allows a player to swap an ability that would otherwise be gained
from their type for the indicated ability instead. A player doesn’t have
to make the swap; they merely have the option. For instance, the focus
Loves the Void provides the option to gain the ability Have Spacesuit,
Will Travel instead of a type ability.

As a character progresses to a new tier, a focus grants more abilities.
Each tier’s benefit is usually labeled Action or Enabler. If an ability
is labeled Action, a character must take an action to use it. If an
ability is labeled Enabler, it makes other actions better or gives some
other benefit, but it’s not an action. An ability that allows a
character to blast foes with lasers is an action. An ability that grants
additional damage when an attack is made is an enabler. An enabler is
used in the same turn as another action, and often as part of another
action.

Each tier’s benefits are independent of and cumulative with benefits
from other tiers (unless indicated otherwise). So if a first-tier
ability grants +1 to Armor and a fourth-tier ability also grants +1 to
Armor, when the character reaches fourth tier, a total of +2 to Armor is
granted.

At tier 3 and tier 6, the character is asked to choose one ability from
the two options provided.

Finally, you can choose whether you want to expand the story behind the
focus (though that’s not mandatory).

FOCUS CONNECTIONS

Choose a connection that goes well with the focus. If you’re a GM
choosing (or creating) one or more foci for your players, choose up to
four of the following connections.

Pick one other PC. For reasons unknown to you, that character is
completely immune to your focus abilities, whether you use them for help
or for harm.

Pick one other PC. You knew of that character years ago, but you don’t
think they knew you.

Pick one other PC. You’re always trying to impress them, but you’re not
sure why.

Pick one other PC. That character has a habit that annoys you, but
you’re otherwise quite impressed with their abilities.

Pick one other PC. That character shows potential in appreciating your
particular paradigm, fighting style, or other  
focus-provided attribute. You would like to train them, but you’re not
necessarily qualified to teach (that’s up to you), and they might not be
interested (that’s up to them).

Pick one other PC. If they are within immediate range when you’re in a
fight, sometimes they provide an asset, and sometimes they accidentally
hinder your attack rolls (FIFTYPERCENT% chance either way, determined
per fight).

Pick one other PC. You once saved their life, and they clearly feel
indebted to you. You wish they didn’t; it’s just part of the job.

Pick one other PC. That character recently mocked you in some fashion
that really hurt your feelings. How you deal with this (if at all) is up
to you.

Pick one other PC. That character knows you have suffered at the hands
of robotic entities in the past. Whether you hate robots now is up to
you, which may affect your relationship with the character if they are
friendly with robots or have robotic parts.

Pick one other PC. That character comes from the same place you do, and
you knew each other as children.

Pick one other PC. In the past, they taught you a few tricks to use in a
fight.

Pick one other PC. That character doesn’t seem to approve of your
methods.

Pick one other PC. Long ago, the two of you were on opposite sides of a
fight. You won, though you “cheated” in their eyes (but from your
perspective, all’s fair in a fight). They may be ready for a rematch,
though that’s up to them.

Pick one other PC. You are always trying  
to impress that character with your skill, wit, appearance, or bravado.
Perhaps they are a rival, perhaps you need their respect, or perhaps
you’re romantically interested  
in them.

Pick one other PC. You fear that character is jealous of your abilities
and worry that it might lead to problems.

Pick one other PC. You accidentally caught them in a trap you set, and
they had to get free on their own.

Pick one other PC. You were once hired to track down someone who was
close to that character.

Pick two PCs (preferably ones who are likely to get in the way of your
attacks). When you miss with an attack and the GM rules that you struck
someone other than your target, you hit one of these two characters.

Pick one other PC. You’re not sure how or from where, but that character
has a line on bottles of rare alcohol and can get them for you for half
price.

Pick one other PC. You recently had a possession go missing, and you’re
becoming convinced that they took it. Whether or not they did is up to
them.

Pick one other PC. They always seem to know where you are, or at least
in what direction you are in relation to them.

Pick one other PC. Seeing you use your focus abilities seems to trigger
an unpleasant memory in that character. That memory is up to the other
PC, although they may not be able to consciously recall it.

Pick one other PC. Something about them interferes with your abilities.
When they stand next to you, your focus abilities cost 1 additional
point.

Pick one other PC. Something about them complements your abilities. When
they stand next to you, the first focus ability you use in any 24-hour
period costs 2 fewer points.

Pick one other PC. You have known that character for a while, and they
helped you gain control of your focus-related abilities.

Pick one other PC. Sometime in that character’s past, they had a
devastating experience while attempting something that you do as a
matter of course thanks to your focus. Whether they choose to tell you
about it is up to them.

Pick one other PC. Their occasional clumsiness and loud behavior
irritate you.

Pick one other PC. In the recent past, while practicing, you
accidentally hit them with an attack, wounding them badly. It is up to
them to decide whether they resent or forgive you.

Pick one other PC. They owe you a significant amount of money.

Pick one other PC. In the recent past, while escaping a threat, you
accidentally left that character to fend for themselves. They survived,
but just barely. It is up to the player of that character to decide
whether they resent you or have decided to forgive you.

Pick one other PC. Recently, they accidentally (or perhaps
intentionally) put you in a position of danger. You’re fine now, but
you’re wary around them.

Pick one other PC. From your perspective, they seem nervous around a
specific idea, person, or situation. You would like to teach them how to
be more comfortable with their fears (if they will let you).

Pick one other PC. They called you a coward once.

Pick one other PC. That character always recognizes you or your
handiwork, whether you’re in disguise or are long gone when they arrive
on the scene.

Pick one other PC. You inadvertently caused an accident that put them
into a sleep so deep they didn’t wake for three days. Whether they
forgive you or not is up to them.

Pick one other PC. You are pretty sure you are related in some fashion.

Pick one other PC. You accidentally learned something they were trying
to keep a secret.

Pick one other PC. They are especially sensitive to the use of your
flashier focus abilities, and occasionally they become dazzled for a few
rounds, which hinders their actions.

Pick one other PC. They appear to have a treasured item that was once
yours, but that you lost in a game of chance years ago.

Pick one other PC. If it wasn’t for you, that character would have
failed a past test of mental achievement.

Pick one other PC. Based on a couple of comments you’ve overheard, you
suspect that they don’t hold your area of training or favorite hobby in
the highest regard.

Pick one other PC whose focus intertwines with yours. This odd
connection affects them in some way. For example, if the character uses
a weapon, your focus ability sometimes improves their attack in some
fashion.

Pick one other PC. They are deathly afraid of heights. You would like to
teach them how to be more comfortable with their feet off the ground.
They must decide whether or not to take you up on your offer.

Pick one other PC. They are skeptical of your claims about something
momentous that happened in your past. They might even attempt to
discredit you or discover the “secret” behind your story, though that’s
up to them.

Pick one other PC. They have a knack for being able to recognize where
your plans or schemes have a weak spot.

Pick one other PC. That character’s face is so intriguing to you in a
way you don’t understand that you sometimes find yourself sketching
their likeness in the dirt or using some other medium you have access
to.

Pick one other PC. That character has an extra item of regular equipment
you gave them, either something you made or an item you just wanted to
give them. (They choose the item.)

Pick one other PC. They commissioned you to do a job for them. You’ve
already been paid but haven’t yet completed the job.

Pick one other PC. You worked together in the past, and the job ended
badly.

Pick one other PC. While they stand next to you and use their action to
concentrate on helping you, one of your focus ability’s ranges is
doubled.

STORY BEHIND THE FOCUS

The foci in this book have been purposely stripped down to basics so
they have the widest possible application across multiple genres. A
single descriptive sentence or two summarizes each one. After you choose
a focus, you have the option to expand its presentation by adding more
story and description relevant to the world or to the character.

For instance, if you choose Operates Undercover, the summarizing
description is “Under the guise of someone else, you seek to find
answers the powerful do not want divulged.” If you choose Conducts Weird
Science, the summary is “Your preternatural insight and ability make you
a scientist capable of amazing feats.” These descriptions provide what
you need to know to use the focus.

However, if you wish (and *only* if you wish; there is no requirement to
do so), you can add more to those descriptions in a fashion that’s
relevant for your game. For example, if you choose both Operates
Undercover and Conducts Weird Science for use in a modern genre such as
horror, urban fantasy, espionage, or something similar, you might expand
the descriptions as shown in the following examples.

Operates Undercover: Espionage is not something you know anything about.
At least, that’s what you want everyone to believe, because in truth,
you’ve been trained as a spy or covert agent. You might work for a
government or for yourself. You might be a police detective or a
criminal. You could even be an investigative reporter.

Regardless, you learn information that others attempt to keep secret.
You collect rumors and whispers, stories and hard-won evidence, and you
use that knowledge to aid your own endeavors and, if appropriate,
provide your employers with the information they desire. Alternatively,
you might sell what you have learned to those willing to pay a premium.

You probably wear dark colors—black, charcoal grey, or midnight blue—to
help blend into the shadows, unless the cover you’ve chosen requires you
to look like someone else.

Conducts Weird Science: You could be a respected scientist, having been
published in several peer-reviewed journals. Or you might be considered
a crank by your contemporaries, pursuing fringe theories on what others
consider to be scant evidence. Truth is, you have a particular gift for
sifting the edges of what’s possible. You can find new insights and
unlock odd phenomena with your experiments. Where others see a crackpot
cornucopia, you sift the conspiracy theories for revelation. Whether you
conduct your enquiries as a government contractor, a university
researcher, a corporate scientist, or an indulger of curiosity in your
own garage lab following your muse, you push the boundaries of what’s
possible.

You probably care more about your work than trivialities such as your
appearance, polite or proper behavior, or social norms, but then again,
an eccentric like you might turn the tables on that stereotype too.

If you want to go even further, you could determine where a character’s
focus abilities come from. Depending on the genre, they could derive
those abilities from advanced and persistent training, via magical
runes, through cybernetic parts, from their genetic heritage, or because
of their access to advanced technology. For instance, a character might
be able to blast targets with lightning because they got zapped by
strange radiation or because they picked up a lightning gun. On the
other hand, it might be because their intense training allowed them to
learn lightning magic. The possibilities are nearly endless, and up to
you to include or forgo. Because however a focus’s abilities were
gained, it’s also enough that they just work.

travel through it.

(Although all character choices are subject to GM approval, Travels
Through Time is a focus that the GM and player should probably have a

CREATING NEW FOCI

This section provides everything you need to create your own foci.

Every focus has an overarching style, whether that’s exploration, energy
manipulation, or simply dealing a lot of damage in combat. These broad
classifications are called focus categories.

Each focus category has an overarching theme, followed by selection
guidelines that describe how to choose abilities for each tier from the
Abilities chapter, from tier 1 to tier 6.

The newly created focus should be named in the form of a verb, like
Controls Beasts or Abides in Stone. For instance, a fire-using focus
created by following the guidelines in the energy manipulation focus
category might be called Bears a Halo of Fire (one of the sample foci in
this chapter). Alternatively, a new fire-using focus should get an
all-new name like Stokes the Flames of the Apocalypse or Lights Fires
With a Thought.

CHOOSING ABILITIES BY RELATIVE POWER

The ability selection guidelines invite you to choose an ability from
one of three ranges: low tier, mid tier, and high tier. These ranges
correspond with the power “grades” given for every ability. These
abilities are further sorted into ability categories based on the kinds
of things they do—abilities that improve physical attacks are in the
attack skill category, abilities that assist allies are in the support
category, and so on. Look for the grades and categories in the Ability
Categories and Relative Power section of the Abilities chapter.

Low-tier abilities are best suited for focus options at tiers 1 and 2.
Mid-tier abilities are best suited for focus options at tiers 3 and 4.
High-tier abilities are best suited for focus options at tiers 5 and 6.

That said, sometimes you’ll find it appropriate to assign a low-tier
ability at tier 3 or 4, or maybe a mid-tier ability at tier 1 or 2. Do
so sparingly, but don’t rule it out. It might be the only way to get all
the abilities you want for the focus you’re building. Higher-tier
abilities usually cost more Pool points to use. So if a mid-tier ability
is made available at tier 1 or 2, or a high-tier ability is made
available at tier 3 or 4, the higher cost will be a balancing factor.

BALANCING ABILITIES

The guidelines within each category go a long way toward ensuring that
the focus you build will be balanced. Sometimes it might be appropriate
to grant a low-power ability along with a regular ability at a given
tier, depending on the needs of the focus. A “low-power ability” is
deliberately open for GM interpretation, but generally speaking, should
be no more potent than a low-tier ability (that is, an ability that is
normally available at tier 1 or 2).

For instance, someone who uses cold might be able to create small snow
sculptures in addition to emitting a cold ray. Someone who uses
electricity might be able to charge a depleted artifact or have an asset
for dealing with electrical systems. And so on.

Often, the focus guidelines note this as a possibility. However, you
have great leeway in deciding if a focus needs an additional ability,
even if the guidelines for that tier don’t indicate one. If you do add
an ability, or there is a  
higher-power ability at a tier that normally shouldn’t have it, it might
mean that the choice given at the next tier, or the previous tier, isn’t
quite as good. Balancing a focus is a bit of an art. Resist the urge to
overpower the focus, but don’t underpower it, either.

ABILITY GUIDELINES ARE NOT PERSCRIPTIVE

Each focus category provides a guideline for what kind of ability you
should select at every tier. But don’t regard the guidelines as
something that you can’t vary. They’re not prescriptive; they’re just a
place to start. You might want to vary the kind of ability at a
particular tier that isn’t indicated in the guidelines. As long as the
chosen ability falls within the expected power curve for that tier, it’s
fine. The guideline isn’t meant to be a straitjacket.

For example, if you’re building a cold-using focus for a game set in a
fantasy genre, you may decide that an ability that calls up a demon is a
better choice at a particular tier than an ability that does damage in
an area, which is what the tier 5 guideline for energy manipulation
calls for. Making the change is probably especially valid if you call
your new focus something like Channels the Ninth Circle.

ABILITY SWAP

If you’re creating a focus and you think it should provide a suite of
abilities at first tier that would mechanically overload it, you have
the option to add one as a “swap” ability. Doing so is as easy as
allowing a character to swap out one of their type abilities for an
indicated low-tier focus ability. The ability is gained instead of one
of the abilities normally granted by the character’s type.

CONCEPT AND CATEGORY

Choosing to create a focus that uses a particular concept—say, creating
illusions—doesn’t lock you into creating a focus within a particular
category—in this case, environment manipulation. A focus can be
constructed in a variety of ways using a particular energy, tool, or
concept, each ultimately leading to a focus that provides different
results. It all depends on your ends. In this case, creating illusions
might be used to sway others, which argues for a focus built using the
influence category guidelines.

In the same way, if a focus grants a character the ability to call some
kind of force or energy, that doesn’t mean the focus should
automatically be built using the energy manipulation category guidelines
(though of course it *could,* if attacking and protecting yourself with
that energy is the point). But a focus could be built that grants
abilities to call energy or force that is primarily focused on
durability, suggesting a tank combat focus (someone who can take a lot
of punishment in a fight); or blasting away with a main concern for
maximizing damage, thus suggesting a striker combat focus; or creating a
follower composed of that energy or force, suggesting an ally use focus
(that is, someone who uses helping creatures, NPCs, or even duplicate
versions of themselves to give them a leg up).

Here’s another example: the focus Controls Gravity could conceivably be
an environment manipulation focus or an energy manipulation focus. It
depends on whether the focus is more concerned with crushing and holding
things in place (environment manipulation) or on blasting things and
protecting yourself with gravity (energy manipulation).

The same malleability of concept holds true in other realms. For
instance, if someone is able to call up and mold raw earth, they might
use it to transform themselves into a being of stone (tank combat), to
batter foes (striker combat), or to create walls, barricades, and
shields to protect their allies (support).

If you’re looking for an ability and can’t seem to find the right one in
the vast catalog in the Abilities chapter, consider reskinning one to
make it seem new (and to accomplish what you need). Reskinning means
that you use the underlying mechanics of an ability as written but
change the flavor in some fashion. For instance, maybe you’re creating a
new earth-moving focus but can’t find enough earth-related abilities to
meet your need. It’s easy enough to change up other abilities so they
use earth instead of fire, cold, or magnetism. For instance, Wings of
Fire might become Wings of Earth, Ice Armor could become Earth Armor,
and so on. These alterations change nothing except the type of damage
and any knock-on effects (for instance, Wings of Earth might generate
clouds of dust in their wake).

Abilities That Reference Other Abilities

Some abilities in the Abilities chapter reference other abilities. If
you select an ability for your focus or type that refers to or modifies
a lower-tier ability, also include that lower-tier ability in your type
or focus as a selection a PC can make at a lower tier.

CREATING BRAND-NEW ABILITIES

You can go further than reskinning and create one or more brand-new
abilities. When doing this, try to find something as close as possible
to the effect you want, then use it as a template. In any case, deciding
how much an ability should cost when it comes to a character’s Pool is
one of the most important aspects of getting an ability right.

You may notice that higher-tier abilities are more expensive. This is
partly because they do more, but it’s also because higher-tier
characters have more Edge than lower-tier characters, which means they
pay fewer points from their relevant Pools. A third-tier character with
3 Edge in a relevant Pool pays no cost for abilities that cost 3 or
fewer points. That’s great for lower-tier abilities, but you’ll usually
want a character to think a little bit about how often to use their most
powerful abilities. That means they should cost at least 1 point more
than the Edge the character is likely to have at that tier. (Often, a
character will have an Edge in their relevant Pool equal to their tier.)

As a good rule of thumb, a typical ability should cost points equal to
its tier.

CHOOSE GM INTRUSIONS

Think about the kinds of things that might surprise, alarm, or go
catastrophically wrong for someone with the new focus being created, and
assign it as a GM intrusion for that focus. Of course, this often is
done on the fly during the game. But giving the topic some thought while
the focus is being constructed and the ideas are fresh in your head is
likely to yield some particularly devilish options.

FOCUS CATEGORIES

ALLY USE

Foci that prioritize providing NPC followers to the character are ally
use foci. The followers give aid to the PC in a variety of ways, but at
base they usually provide an asset to the character’s actions.

Multiple potential themes exist within the ally use category, from
abilities that allow a character to summon or craft allies to those that
allow them to attract allies through fame, magic, or essential authority
or charisma.

Connection: Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections
list.

Additional Equipment: Any object necessary for the character to keep an
ally. For instance, someone with a focus that uses super-science to
create robot allies would require tools to build and repair those
allies. Some foci in this category don’t require anything to gain or
retain their benefits.

Minor Effect Suggestions: The NPC ally’s tasks are eased on its next
turn.

Major Effect Suggestions: The NPC ally gains an immediate extra action.

The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of
all possible foci in this category.

• Builds Robots

• Consorts With the Dead

• Controls Beasts

• Exists in Two Places at Once

• Leads

• Masters the Swarm

• Shepherds Spirits

Ability Selection Guidelines

Tier 1: Choose a low-tier ability that grants a level 2 NPC follower to
the character, or gives a similar benefit provided by an NPC.
Alternatively, lay the groundwork for gaining such NPC allies at higher
tiers by choosing an ability that gives the character influence over
others.

Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on
the focus. Often, this is an ability that grants skill training in a
related area of knowledge or a related skill. For instance, training in
a skill related to the kind of NPC follower the character gains would be
appropriate.

Tier 2: Choose a low-tier ability that grants influence over similar
kinds of NPCs as the follower gained at the previous tier. If no
follower was gained at the previous tier, this ability should provide
that benefit now.

Sometimes a secondary ability might be appropriate in addition to the
ability provided above, perhaps a low-power ability that grants 2 or 3
points to a Pool.

Tier 3: Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for
the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

One option should be a mid-tier ability that improves the NPC follower
previously provided (usually from level 2 to level 3) or grants an
additional follower.

The other option should be something that benefits the character—perhaps
an offensive or defensive ability, or something that broadens their
influence over their followers (or potential followers).

Tier 4: Choose a mid-tier ability that gives the character an offensive
or defensive capability if they haven’t previously gained one,
preferably within the theme of the focus. For instance, if the character
gains followers because of their charisma, this ability might let them
command foes for brief periods. If the character gains followers by
building or calling them, this ability might let them affect entities of
the same type that are not already their followers.

Alternatively, this ability might further improve a previously gained
follower from level 3 to level 4, or grant an additional follower.

Tier 5: Choose an ability that improves the character by providing a
defense, an improved stat Pool, or another kind of protection.

Alternatively, this ability could open a new front in influencing and
calling NPC allies related to the focus’s theme. For instance, someone
who keeps beast allies might gain an ability to call a horde of lesser
beasts. Someone who builds robots might gain an ability to build several
lesser robot helpers. And so on.

Finally, this ability might improve a previously gained follower to
level 5.

Tier 6: Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for
the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

One of the abilities should improve a previously gained follower to
level 5, if that wasn’t already provided at tier 5. If that’s the case,
this ability might be provided *in addition* to two other related
abilities.

Another high-tier option could provide a handful of level 3 followers to
the character.

The last high-tier ability could open a new front in influencing and
calling NPC allies related to the focus’s theme. For instance, someone
who gains followers through high charisma and training might gain an
ability to learn otherwise impossible-to-glean information.

BASIC

Foci that rely mostly on providing skill training, assets to tasks, and
bumps to stat Pools and Edge in order to improve a character fall within
the basic category. An overarching theme is also included, as with most
of the other categories, that makes sense of the various basic abilities
provided.

In addition, because the benefits provided by such foci are mostly
straightforward (usually with a few exceptions), most basic foci would
also be appropriate for non-fantastic campaigns where magic,
super-science, or psychic abilities normally don’t come into play. That
said, just because the abilities granted by basic foci are
straightforward doesn’t mean they are not potent when combined with the
abilities granted by type, descriptor, cyphers, and other character
aspects.

Connection: Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections
list.

Additional Equipment: Any object necessary to fulfill the overarching
theme of the focus. For instance, a focus called Would Rather Be Reading
should grant a handful of books to the character. A focus called Works
for a Living should provide a set of tools.

Minor Effect Suggestions: Next action is eased.

Major Effect Suggestions: Make a free, no-action recovery roll that
doesn’t count against daily recovery rolls.

The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of
all possible foci in this category.

• Doesn’t Do Much

• Interprets the Law

• Learns Quickly

• Works for a Living

• Would Rather Be Reading

Ability Selection Guidelines

Tier 1: Choose an ability that grants training or an asset to skills
associated with the focus’s theme, or that grants 5 or 6 points to a
particular Pool.

Alternatively, choose an ability that grants only 2 or 3 points to a
particular Pool and an ability that provides training or an asset to
just one task.

Tier 2: Choose whichever kind of ability wasn’t chosen at tier 1.

Tier 3: Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for
the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

One option should be a non-fantastic ability that improves the
character’s abilities within the focus’s theme. For instance, if the
theme involves paying attention in some fashion, an
information-gathering ability might be appropriate.

The other option should be something that either improves the
character’s Edge in an appropriate stat or provides the character with
some kind of defense.

Tier 4: Choose another ability that grants additional training or an
asset to skills associated with the focus’s theme, or that grants 5 or 6
points to a particular Pool best suited to the focus. Or choose two
abilities that provide only 2 or 3 points plus another tier 4 ability
that improves a single task or skill.

Alternatively, provide a branch-out ability suggested at tier 5.

Finally, if the focus has yet to grant some kind of defense, a defensive
ability could be provided here.

Tier 5: Choose an ability that allows the character to branch out
slightly—perhaps one like Expert Skill that allows them to automatically
succeed on a task they’re trained in.

Alternatively, if a nonstandard benefit was provided at tier 4, provide
the benefits suggested at tier 4 here.

Tier 6: Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for
the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

One option should be an ability that provides another 5 or 6 points to a
particular Pool best suited to the focus, or that the character can
divide up as they wish. Alternatively, training in offense or defense
would also be appropriate.

The other tier 6 option should give the character a brand-new ability
within their theme, but not one that strays into the realm of the
fantastic. For instance, an ability that allows a character to take two
actions instead of one would be reasonable. Granting additional
training, assets, or Edge would also be fine.

ENERGY MANIPULATION

Energy manipulation foci offer abilities that can call fire,
electricity, force, magnetism, or nonstandard forms of energy such as
cold, stone, or something stranger like “void” or “shadow.” These
abilities usually give a character a way to achieve something of a
balance between attacking enemies and granting themselves or allies
additional protection. The focus usually also offers abilities that
provide other ways to use specific energy for things like
transportation, creating large concentrations of energy that can affect
multiple targets, or creating a temporary object or barrier of energy.

Connection: Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections
list.

Additional Equipment: One or more pieces of equipment immune to the
energy manipulated, which might be a set of clothes. Alternatively,
something related to the energy being generated. Some foci in this
category don’t require additional equipment.

Energy Abilities: If a character type grants special abilities that
normally use some other kind of energy, they now produce the kind used
by this focus. For example, if a character uses this focus to manipulate
electricity, their force blasts become blasts of electricity. These
alterations change nothing except the type of damage and any knock-on
effects (for instance, electricity might temporarily short out
electronic systems).

Minor Effect Suggestions: The target or something near the target is
hindered because of residual energy.

Major Effect Suggestions: An important item on the target’s person is
destroyed.

The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of
all possible foci in this category.

• Absorbs Energy

• Bears a Halo of Fire

• Dances With Dark Matter

• Rides the Lightning

• Thunders

• Wears a Sheen of Ice

Ability Selection Guidelines

Tier 1: Choose a low-tier ability that either inflicts damage or
provides protection using the appropriate energy type in some fashion.

Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on
the energy type. For instance, a focus that manipulates cold might grant
an ability to create snow sculptures. A focus that manipulates
electricity might grant an ability to charge a depleted artifact or have
an asset for dealing with electrical systems. A focus that absorbs
energy might grant an ability to release it as a basic attack. And so
on.

Tier 2: Choose whichever kind of ability wasn’t chosen at tier 1.

Tier 3: Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for
the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

One option should be an ability that inflicts damage using the
appropriate energy type (and possibly a related effect).

The other should grant enhanced movement by use of the appropriate
energy type, give additional protection provided by the preferred
energy, or use the energy in a completely new way, such as by draining
the energy from a machine (if using electricity), entombing a victim in
a layer of ice (if using cold), creating perfect silence (if using
sound), creating a dazzling blast of illumination (if using light), and
so on.

Tier 4: Choose whichever kind of ability wasn’t chosen at tier 3.

Tier 5: Choose a high-tier ability that inflicts damage (and possibly a
related effect) that can affect more than one target using the
appropriate energy type, or an ability that uses the energy in some
fashion not previously used, as described in tiers 3 and 6.

Tier 6: Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for
the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

One of the high-tier abilities should use the preferred energy to
inflict a lot of damage to a single target or to several.

The other option should use the appropriate energy type to accomplish a
task not previously provided by lower-tier abilities, such as fashioning
a fiery follower (if using fire), teleporting a great distance as a
blast of lightning (if using electricity), creating solid objects out of
the energy, and so on.

ENVIRONMENT MANIPULATION

Foci that allow a character to move objects, affect gravity, create
objects (or illusions of objects), and so on are environment
manipulation foci. Given that, in many cases, energy is used as part of
this process, this category and energy manipulation overlap to some
extent. Environment manipulation foci prioritize abilities that
indirectly affect enemies and allies via objects, forces, and
alterations of the surroundings; energy manipulation foci prioritize
directly damaging targets with the chosen energy or force.

For example, rather than blasting a foe with a gravity pulse that does
damage, a character using an environment manipulation focus based on
gravity is more likely to have abilities that hold a target in place,
use gravity to throw heavy objects as an attack, or lower gravity in a
particular area or even on a particular object.

Connection: Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections
list.

Additional Equipment: Any object necessary to manipulate the surrounding
environment. For instance, someone with a focus that grants the ability
to craft objects would require basic tools. Some foci in this category
don’t require anything to gain or retain their benefits.

Environment Manipulation Abilities: Foci themes that involve imagery or
visible energies can affect the look of your type abilities. Such
alterations, if any, do nothing but change the appearance of effects. If
gravity is manipulated, perhaps a telltale bluish glow permeates all
ability uses, including type abilities. If illusion is generated,
perhaps flamboyant visual and auditory qualities accompany type
abilities, such as the appearance of a tentacled beast holding a target
in place when Stasis is used. And so on.

Minor Effect Suggestions: The target gets turned around, and its next
attack is hindered.

Major Effect Suggestions: The character is refreshed and recovers 4
points to one Pool.

The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of
all possible foci in this category.

• Awakens Dreams

• Blazes With Radiance

• Calculates the Incalculable

• Controls Gravity

• Crafts Illusions

• Crafts Unique Objects

• Employs Magnetism

• Focuses Mind Over Matter

Ability Selection Guidelines

Tier 1: Choose a low-tier ability that grants a basic use of an ability
that alters the environment (or predicts it) using the focus’s theme.
For instance, a gravity-affecting focus might provide an ability that
makes a target lighter or heavier. An  
illusion-crafting focus might grant an ability that allows the creation
of an image. An object-making focus might grant a basic proficiency in
creating a particular kind of object. A predictive focus might calculate
outcomes and provide the character with the benefits of that
foreknowledge. And so on.

Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on
the focus. Often, this is an ability that grants skill training in a
related area of knowledge.

Tier 2: Choose a low-tier ability that provides a new defensive or
offensive capability related to the focus’s theme.

Alternatively, this ability might provide an additional or brand-new
capability to manipulate the environment related to the focus’s theme.

Tier 3: Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for
the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

One option should be a mid-tier ability related to the focus’s theme
that provides an additional environment manipulation capacity or further
improves the basic environment manipulation ability previously granted.
This ability isn’t directly offensive or defensive, but provides either
an all-new ability related to the basic ability, or one that increases
the strength, range, or some other extension of the previously unlocked
basic ability.

The other mid-tier option should provide an offensive or defensive
ability related to the specific form of movement the focus provides, if
possible.

Tier 4: Choose a mid-tier ability that is either an offensive or a
defensive use of the ability, whichever one wasn’t chosen as an option
in the previous tier.

Tier 5: Choose a high-tier penultimate use of the
environment-manipulation ability. For instance, if the focus-granted
manipulation is illusory, this ability might haunt a target with
terrifying images. If the focus is gravity based, it might unlock
flight. If magnetic, it might allow the user to reshape metal. If the
focus grants telekinetic powers, this ability could allow a character to
hurl massive objects at foes. And so on.

Tier 6: Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for
the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

One of the abilities should provide either an offensive or a defensive
ability, opposite the ability provided at tier 4 (though high tier
rather than mid tier).

The other option should be something that further explores the use of
the basic environment manipulation capability. If the tier 5 choice was
the penultimate ability, this might be an even better ultimate ability
related to the kind of manipulation offered, or a different way of using
that ability to unlock an as-yet-unexplored facet of the ability.

EXPLORATION

Foci that allow a character to gather information, survive in unfamiliar
environments, and find their way to new locations or track down
particular creatures and foes are exploration foci. Surviving in
unfamiliar environments requires a reasonable selection of defensive
options; however, abilities that allow a character to find and learn are
prioritized.

Exploration foci rely on a variety of methods, though training and
expertise are the mainstays. Some methods require specific tools (such
as a vehicle) to grant the benefits provided, while others might rely on
the supernatural or  
super-science to learn new things and explore strange places from afar.

Connection: Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections
list.

Additional Equipment: Any object necessary to explore. For instance,
starting maps and/or  
a compass would be basic equipment, while someone who uses psychic
abilities might require a mirror or crystal sphere to gaze into.
Equipment might also include access to a vehicle required for
exploration, as previously noted.

Minor Effect Suggestions: You have an asset on any action that involves
using your senses, such as perceiving or attacking, until the end of the
next round.

Major Effect Suggestions: Your Intellect Edge increases by 1 until the
end of the next round.

The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of
all possible foci in this category.

• Explores Dark Places

• Infiltrates

• Operates Undercover

• Pilots Starcraft

• Sees Beyond

• Separates Mind From Body

Ability Selection Guidelines

Tier 1: Choose a low-tier ability that grants the character basic
exploratory, survival, or information-gathering capabilities within the
focus’s theme.

Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on
the focus. Often, this is an ability that grants skill training in a
related area of knowledge or a related skill (though this may already be
covered in the main ability). Alternatively, it might offer a simple
bonus of 2 or 3 points to the Might Pool.

Tier 2: Choose another low-tier ability that grants an additional
capability related to exploration, survival, or information gathering.

For instance, a focus dedicated to surviving savage conditions might
offer an ability (or two) that makes it easier to avoid natural hazards,
poisons, difficult terrain, and so on. A focus dedicated to exploration
of a particular area might grant abilities to gain access to that area,
or a capability that others normally lack (like the ability to see in
the dark).

Tier 3: Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for
the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

One option should further improve the basic exploration ability granted,
or give a new exploratory, survival, or information-gathering ability.

The other option should be something that benefits the character, either
an offensive or defensive ability (especially if this focus hasn’t
already granted that) or something that further broadens the character’s
ability to explore in the focus’s chosen realm.

Tier 4: Choose a mid-tier offensive or defensive ability (whichever
wasn’t offered at tier 3) that benefits the character. Alternatively, if
offensive and defensive abilities are already well represented, choose a
different mid-tier ability that broadens the character’s ability to
explore, survive, or gather information.

Tier 5: Choose a high-tier ability that alleviates some of the penalties
for exploring, surviving, or gathering information in a normally
inhospitable place.

Tier 6: Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for
the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

One option should further improve the basic exploration-themed ability
previously granted, or give a brand-new exploratory, survival, or
information-gathering ability.

The other option should be something that benefits the character, either
an offensive or defensive ability, or yet another ability that further
broadens their capacity to explore in the focus’s chosen realm.

INFLUENCE

Foci that prioritize authority and influence—whether that’s to make
people or machines do as commanded, to help others, or to rise to some
other prestigious and significant position—fall within the influence
category.

These foci grant influence through training and persuasion, by direct
mental manipulation, by using fame to get people’s attention and
influence their actions, or simply by knowing and learning things that
affect later decisions. In this sense, the concept of influence is
broad.

Connection: Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections
list.

Additional Equipment: Any object necessary to achieve the influence
suggested should be granted as additional equipment. Some influence foci
don’t require anything to gain or retain their benefits.

Minor Effect Suggestions: The range or duration of the influencing
ability is doubled.

Major Effect Suggestions: An ally or indicated target can take an
additional action.

The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of
all possible foci in this category.

• Commands Mental Powers

• Conducts Weird Science

• Fuses Mind and Machine

• Is Idolized by Millions

• Solves Mysteries

• Talks to Machines

• Works the System

Ability Selection Guidelines

Tier 1: Choose a low-tier ability that allows the character to learn
something significant enough that they can choose a smart course of
action (or use that knowledge to persuade or intimidate). How the
character learns the information varies by the specifics of the focus.
One character might do experiments to learn answers, another might open
a telepathic link with others to trade information secretly and quickly,
and still another might simply be trained in interaction tasks.

Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on
the focus. Often, this is an ability that grants skill training in a
related area of knowledge.

Tier 2: Choose a low-tier ability that improves the character’s ability
to apply influence. This might open an additional front on the focus’s
basic theme or simply further enhance the basic ability already
provided. For instance, this tier 2 ability could ease influence-related
tasks by a few steps, allow a telepath to read the minds of others who
have secrets they’d otherwise not reveal, or grant influence over
physical objects (either to improve them or to learn more about them).
And so on.

Tier 3: Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for
the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

One option should provide an offensive or defensive capability related
to the focus’s specific kind of influence, if possible. For instance, an
inventor might create a serum that gives them increased abilities (which
could be used for offense or defense), a telepath might have some method
of blasting foes with mental energy, and someone with only the basic
skills of debate and influence through fame might have to rely on weapon
training or their entourage.

The other mid-tier option should provide an additional ability to
influence in the theme of the focus, or further improve the basic
influence ability previously granted. This option isn’t directly
offensive or defensive, but provides either an all-new ability related
to the basic ability, or increases the strength, range, or some other
extension of the previously unlocked basic ability. For instance, a
telepath might have a psychic suggestion ability.

Tier 4: Choose a mid-tier ability that is either an offensive or a
defensive use of the influence ability, whichever one wasn’t chosen as
an option in the previous tier.

Alternatively, this ability could grant an additional capability related
to the kind of influence the focus provides.

Tier 5: Choose a high-tier penultimate use of the specific influence
ability granted at lower tiers.

Alternatively, choose an ability not previously gained at a lower tier,
one that opens a new front on the particular influence capability. For
instance, if the focus-granted influence is telepathic, the tier 5
ability might allow a character to see into the future to gain assets
for dealing with enemies (and allies).

Tier 6: Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for
the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

One of the options should provide either an offensive or a defensive
ability, opposite the ability provided at tier 4 (though high tier
rather than mid tier).

The other option should be something that further explores the use of
the basic influence ability provided by the focus. If the tier 5 choice
was the penultimate ability, this might be an even better ultimate
ability related to the kind of influence used, or a different way of
using that ability to unlock an as-yet-unexplored facet of the ability.

IRREGULAR

Most foci have a basic theme, a “character story” that logically leads
to a series of related abilities. However, certain foci themes are so
wide that they don’t fit into any other category except an irregular one
of their own.

Irregular foci provide a basket of disparate abilities. Usually that’s
because the overarching theme is one that demands variability and access
to several different kinds of abilities. Often, these foci are found in
genres that suggest additional rule tweaks to leverage their use even
further, such as power shifts in the superhero genre and spellcasting in
the fantasy genre. However, other irregular foci are possible.

Connection: Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections
list.

Additional Equipment: Any object necessary to the focus’s theme. For
instance, a  
superhero-themed focus might grant a superhero costume.

Minor Effect Suggestions: The target is also dazed for one round, during
which time all of its tasks are hindered.

Major Effect Suggestions: The target is stunned and loses its next turn.

The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of
all possible foci in this category.

• Channels Divine Blessings

• Descends From Nobility

• Emerged From the Obelisk

• Flies Faster Than a Bullet

• Masters Spells

• Speaks for the Land

Ability Selection Guidelines

Tier 1: Choose a low-tier ability that grants one of the benefits the
focus theme promises, one that a first-tier character should have.

Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on
the focus. Often, this is an ability that grants skill training in a
related area of knowledge or a related skill. Alternatively, it might
offer a simple bonus of 2 or 3 points to a Pool.

Tier 2: Choose a low-tier ability that grants one of the benefits the
focus theme promises, one that’s presumably not immediately related to
the one provided at tier 1. That said, if a defense wasn’t provided at
tier 1, tier 2 is a good place to add it.

Tier 3: Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for
the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

One option should provide one of the benefits the focus theme promises,
one that may not be immediately related to those provided at earlier
tiers.

The other option should include a method of attack if none has
previously been granted. Alternatively, if the lower-tier abilities
don’t quite get the character where they need to be, this option might
further increase a capability unlocked at a lower tier.

Tier 4: Choose a mid-tier ability that grants one of the benefits the
focus theme promises, one that may not be immediately related to those
provided at earlier tiers.

Tier 5: Choose a high-tier ability that grants one of the benefits the
focus theme promises, one that may not be immediately related to those
provided at earlier tiers.

Tier 6: Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for
the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

One option should grant one of the benefits the focus theme promises,
one that may not be immediately related to those provided at earlier
tiers. However, this ability might also provide an ultimate version of a
lower-tier ability if a mid-tier or low-tier option wasn’t quite
sufficient.

The other option should provide an alternate method to round out the
character in a way that doesn’t replicate the first tier 6 option. For
instance, if the first option provided some kind of attack, this one
might be an interaction, information-gathering, or healing ability,
depending on the focus’s overarching theme.

MOVEMENT EXPERTISE

Foci that prioritize novel forms of movement—in order to excel in
combat, escape situations most others can’t, move with stealth for
purposes of theft or escape, or move into locations normally
inaccessible—fall within the movement expertise category. These foci
usually have methods of granting either offense or defense through
movement, though they may provide some means of doing both.

The classic movement expertise focus is one that relies on speed to make
more attacks and avoid being hit, though general agility might also
provide the same benefit. Other foci in this category might fall within
the theme by granting a character the ability to become immaterial, to
change their form into something like water or air, or to instantly move
via teleportation.

Connection: Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections
list.

Additional Equipment: Any object necessary to achieve great speeds,
change state, or otherwise gain the benefit of the focus should be
granted as additional equipment. Some foci in this category don’t
require anything to gain or retain their benefits.

Minor Effect Suggestions: The target is dazed, and their next action is
hindered.

Major Effect Suggestions: The target is stunned and loses their next
action.

The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of
all possible foci in this category.

• Exists Partially Out of Phase

• Moves Like a Cat

• Moves Like the Wind

• Runs Away

• Shreds the Walls of the World

• Travels Through Time

• Works the Back Alleys

Ability Selection Guidelines

Tier 1: Choose a low-tier ability that grants the basic benefit of the
specific movement style, whether that’s enhanced speed, agility,
immateriality, and so on.

Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on
the focus. If the basic benefit of the movement demands some kind of
additional understanding or training, this ability could be that.
Alternatively, if the movement provided seems like it should also unlock
a basic offensive or defensive benefit (relying on the use of the
initial basic ability), append it as well.

Tier 2: Choose a low-tier ability that provides a new offensive or
defensive capability related to the focus’s theme.

Alternatively, this ability might provide some additional capability
related to the form of movement that grants useful information to the
character that would normally be inaccessible to someone without the
focus.

Tier 3: Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for
the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

One option should provide an additional movement capacity or further
improve the basic movement capacity, related to the focus’s theme. This
isn’t directly offensive or defensive, but provides the character with a
new level of ability or an all-new ability related to their basic
movement ability.

The other option should provide either an offensive or a defensive
capability related to the specific form of movement the focus provides.

Tier 4: Choose a mid-tier ability that further enhances the advantages
provided by focus’s movement-enhancing paradigm. This could provide a
new or better form of defense (directly, or indirectly if moving to a
location or time where danger doesn’t threaten), or a new or better form
of offense.

Tier 5: Choose a high-tier penultimate use of the movement-related
ability. For instance, if the focus-provided movement is temporal, this
ability might allow actual (if brief) jaunts of time travel. If the
focus enhances speed, this ability might allow the character to move up
to a very long distance with one action. And so on.

Alternatively, unlock an as-yet-unexplored related ability that could
derive from the basic movement power provided by the focus.

Tier 6: Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for
the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

One of the options should provide either an offensive or a defensive
ability, opposite the ability provided at tier 4 (though high tier
rather than mid tier).

The other option should be something that further explores the use of
the basic  
movement ability. If the tier 5 choice was the penultimate ability, this
might be an even better ultimate ability related to the movement.

STRIKER COMBAT

Striker combat foci prioritize dealing damage in battle over other
concerns. Foci in this category offer defensive abilities as well, but
they emphasize abilities that provide ways to spike damage to heights
that other foci normally don’t reach.

To achieve this end, a striker combat focus might offer mastery of a
particular style of martial combat, which could be training with a
particular weapon or martial art, or the use of a unique tool (or even a
kind of energy). A style might be something as singular as being the
best at fighting a particular kind of enemy, or something much broader,
such as adopting a particularly vicious or unsporting style. A striker
combatant might use fire, force, or magnetism as their preferred method
of spiking damage.

Connection: Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections
list.

Additional Equipment: The weapon, tool, or other special item or
substance (if any) required to engage in the particular style of combat.
For instance, a dose of level 5 poison for Fights Dirty or Murders, a
trophy from a previously defeated foe for Battles Robots, or stylish
clothes for Fights With Panache.

Minor Effect Suggestions: The target is so dazzled by your expertise
that it is dazed for one round, hindering all of its tasks.

Major Effect Suggestions: Make an immediate additional attack using an
attack provided by the focus as part of your turn.

The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of
all possible foci in this category.

• Battles Robots

• Fights Dirty

• Fights With Panache

• Hunts

• Is Licensed to Carry

• Looks for Trouble

• Masters Weaponry

• Murders

• Needs No Weapon

• Performs Feats of Strength

• Rages

• Slays Monsters

• Throws With Deadly Accuracy

• Wields Two Weapons at

Once

Ability Selection Guidelines

Tier 1: Choose a low-tier ability that inflicts additional damage when a
character attacks using the focus’s particular fighting style, energy,
or attitude, or when used against a chosen enemy.

Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on
the focus. For instance, a focus that grants proficiency in a special
weapon might offer training in crafting tasks associated with that
weapon. A focus that grants increased damage against a particular kind
of foe might offer training in skills to recognize, locate, or just have
general knowledge about that foe. A fighting style that involves
fighting in a vicious or dirty manner might provide training in
intimidation. And so on.

If the focus is about fighting a particular enemy, additional secondary
powers (more than might otherwise be offered) may be appropriate. Those
either further enhance effectiveness against the chosen enemy, or offer
broader but related abilities that give the character who takes the
focus some functionality even when not fighting that enemy.

Tier 2: Choose a low-tier ability that provides some form of defense
using the weapon, weapon style, or chosen energy. If the weapon style is
being especially good at fighting a certain kind of foe, the ability
should be a defense against that kind of foe. Alternatively, the focus
might offer another method for increasing damage within the chosen
paradigm.

Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate at tier 2. If
so, choose whichever  
low-power ability wasn’t gained at tier 1.

Tier 3: Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for
the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

One option should inflict additional damage when using the focus’s
fighting style, energy, or attitude, or when used against a chosen
enemy. That could be as simple as an ability that offers an additional
attack of that kind.

The other option should provide a method to temporarily neutralize a foe
by disarming them, dazing or stunning them, slowing or holding them, or
otherwise discombobulating them by using the focus’s fighting style,
energy, or attitude, or when used against a chosen enemy.

Tier 4: Choose a mid-tier ability that further enhances the advantages
provided by the focus’s paradigm. Often, this includes training in a
particular kind of attack. Alternatively, the ability might increase the
advantages provided by achieving a certain combat status, such as
gaining surprise.

Tier 5: Choose a high-tier ability that inflicts damage. Alternatively,
if focused on fighting a particular kind of foe, this ability might give
the character a chance to completely neutralize, destroy, blind, or kill
a singular target of up to level 3 (or higher, if the focus is on a
singular foe).

Tier 6: Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for
the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

One of the options should use the focus paradigm to inflict an
exceptional amount of damage.

The other option could be a different way of inflicting damage, either
using the focus paradigm or just dealing lots of damage in general (and
relying on previous focus tier abilities to improve targeting). This
could be against multiple targets if the first option was for a single
target, to outright kill or neutralize a target (starting with level 4,
but with guidance for using Effort to increase the level of the target),
or to select yet another foe, make another attack, or get away in order
to fight another day.

SUPPORT

Foci that allow a character to help others succeed, defend others, heal
others who are hurt, and so on are support foci. Of course, most foci
abilities are often used in aid of others, but support foci (such as
Siphons Power) prioritize aiding, healing, and improving the character
who takes the focus.

Support foci rely on a variety of methods to provide their help,
including martial training used in defense, supernatural or sci-fi means
of providing healing, or simply easing the cares of others through
entertainment.

Connection: Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections
list.

Additional Equipment: Any object necessary to provide support. For
instance, someone with a focus that uses entertainment to help others
would require an instrument or similar object in aid of their craft.
Some foci in this category don’t require anything to gain or retain
their benefits.

Minor Effect Suggestions: You can draw an attack without having to use
an action at any point before the end of the next round.

Major Effect Suggestions: You can take an extra action in aid of an
ally.

The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of
all possible foci in this category.

• Defends the Weak

• Entertains

• Helps Their Friends

• Metes Out Justice

• Shepherds the Community

• Siphons Power

• Works Miracles

Ability Selection Guidelines

Tier 1: Choose a low-tier ability that provides some form of defense,
aid or entertainment, benefit to recovery or healing, or protection.
That defense or protection could be to the PC and not to an ally, as one
cannot protect another without first being able to protect themselves
(and sometimes protecting themselves is the entire point).

Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on
the focus. Often, this is an ability that grants skill training in a
related area of knowledge or a related skill, but it might be something
that works with the initial ability that, by itself, wouldn’t do much.

Tier 2: Choose a low-tier ability that follows up on the support style
opened in the previous tier. If the previous tier’s ability provided a
means of protection only for the focus taker, this tier 2 ability should
specifically provide aid to another. If the previous tier specifically
provided aid to another, this tier 2 ability could defend the focus
taker or provide an offensive capability grounded, if possible, in the
focus’s theme.

Tier 3: Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for
the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

One option should work within the focus’s theme to aid, heal, protect,
or otherwise help another.

The other option should be something that benefits the character, either
an offensive or defensive ability, or something that broadens their
expertise in some fashion. Alternatively, it could be another, different
method of helping someone else.

Tier 4: Choose a mid-tier ability that gives an ally a direct boon or
provides the character with a way to help another. It could also be an
ability that harms or nullifies a foe, as removing foes certainly helps
allies.

Tier 5: Choose a high-tier ability that provides an offensive or
defensive option for the character, if none have been provided yet. If
this need has been previously addressed or is deemed unnecessary, choose
a high-tier ability that provides some form of defense, aid or
entertainment, benefit to recovery or healing, or protection to another.
For example, a tier 5 ability might grant an ally an additional free
action or allow them to repeat a failed action.

Tier 6: Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for
the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

One of the options should provide an ultimate method of helping another
in the theme of the focus.

The other option could provide an alternative ultimate method of helping
another; many foci in this category do. However, an option that provides
high-tier offense or defense is also completely reasonable.

TANK COMBAT

Foci that prioritize being able to take a lot of punishment and soak up
excess damage from foes fall within the tank combat category. These foci
provide offensive abilities too, as well as additional abilities related
to the particular method by which improved protection is achieved, but
defensive abilities are most pronounced.

Some tank combat foci involve a physical transformation that grants
additional protection, and others rely on specialized training, use
tools like shields or heavy armor, or provide the ability to heal
incredibly fast. The kinds of physical transformation that a tank focus
provides, if any, vary widely. A focus might turn a character’s skin to
stone, reinforce their body with metal, turn them into a monstrous
being, make them so big it becomes harder to hurt them, and so on.

Connection: Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections
list.

Additional Equipment: Any object necessary to maintain a physical
transformation (such as a tool for repair if partly robotic, a shield or
other defensive tool used if skilled, or possibly some kind of amulet or
serum). Some tank combat foci don’t require anything to gain or retain
their benefits.

Minor Effect Suggestions: +2 to Armor for a few rounds.

Major Effect Suggestions: Regain 2 points to Might Pool.

The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of
all possible foci in this category.

• Abides in Stone

• Brandishes an Exotic

Shield

• Defends the Gate

• Fuses Flesh and Steel

• Grows to Towering Heights

• Howls at the Moon

• Lives in the Wilderness

• Masters Defense

• Never Says Die

• Stands Like a Bastion

Ability Selection Guidelines

Tier 1: Choose a low-tier ability that provides defense within the
focus’s theme. If the theme is simply intense training or the use of a
defensive tool, the ability might be as simple as a bonus to Armor. If
protection comes from physical transformation, this ability provides the
base form effects, benefits, and in some cases drawbacks for making the
transformation. A low-tier enhanced healing ability would also be
appropriate at first tier.

Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on
the focus. If the character transforms, this ability may provide a
knock-on effect, though in the case of some transformations, it might be
a description of how someone with an abnormal physiognomy can fully
heal. Other times, the secondary power may simply be training in a
related skill, or it may unlock the ability to use a particular armor or
shield without penalty.

Tier 2: If the theme of the focus isn’t physical transformation, choose
a low-tier ability that provides an additional method of defending,
healing damage, or avoiding attacks.

If the theme of the focus is physical transformation, choose a low-tier
ability that unlocks a new capability related to the form the character
takes. That might mean gaining better control of the transformation,
unlocking a robotic interface, or otherwise more fully unlocking that
form. This ability is not necessarily defensive, though it could be.

Tier 3: Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for
the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

One option should provide an additional form of protection in keeping
with the focus’s theme, such as more defensive capabilities unlocked
from a transformation (which might also come with additional offensive
capabilities) or a simple physical enhancement if defense is gained by
skills or enhanced healing.

The other option should provide an offensive  
capability, especially if creating a non-transformation  
focus that doesn’t already have offensive benefits. That capability
could be an enhanced attack or provide some other benefit useful in
combat, such as quickly evading or (on the other end of the continuum)
becoming immovable.

Tier 4: Choose a mid-tier ability that further enhances the advantages
provided by the focus’s damage-soaking paradigm. Often, this includes
training in a particular kind of defense. Alternatively, it might
increase the advantages provided by previously unlocked defensive
abilities, whether that means gaining greater control over a
transformation, gaining additional chances to avoid damage or retry
tasks related to enhanced determination, and so on. If the focus is
lacking in offensive options, this is a good place to include one.

Tier 5: Choose a high-tier ability that provides protection, possibly in
the form of shrugging off a debilitating condition (including death). If
the focus offers a physical transformation, this ability might further
unlock an additional related ability, whether offensive, defensive, or
something related to exploration or interaction (such as flight if the
form is winged, intimidation if the form is fearsome, and so on).

Tier 6: Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for
the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

One option should use the focus paradigm to increase the defense,
protection, or ability to shrug off damage.

The other option could be a different way of being defensive. In some
cases, the best defense is a good offense, so this option could provide
a high-tier offensive ability in keeping with the focus’s theme, whether
that’s a straight-up damage boost on attacks or better control of an
unstable physical transformation.

SUPERHERO FOCI

CUSTOMIZING FOCI

Sometimes not everything about a focus is right for a character’s
concept, or perhaps the GM needs additional guidelines for creating a
new focus. Either way, the solution lies in looking at foci abilities at
their most basic default levels.

At any tier, a player can select one of the following abilities in place
of the ability granted by the tier. Many of these replacement abilities,
particularly at the higher tiers, might involve body modification,
integration with high-tech  
devices, learning powerful magic spells, uncovering forbidden secrets,
or something similar appropriate to the genre.

Abilities

This chapter presents a vast catalog of more than a thousand abilities a
character can gain from their type, flavor (if any), and focus. They are
sorted alphabetically by the ability’s name.

A character’s type, flavor, and focus assign an appropriate tier to each
ability. However, if you’re creating a brand-new focus or type, we
provide a couple of additional tools.

The first is a power grade for each ability, which tells you about how
potent it is in relation to other abilities. Abilities appropriate for
tiers 1 and 2 characters are called “low-tier” abilities. Abilities
appropriate for tiers 3 and 4 are called “mid-tier” abilities. Abilities
appropriate for tiers 5 and 6 are called “high-tier” abilities.

These abilities are further sorted into ability categories based on the
kinds of things they do—abilities that improve physical attacks are in
the attack skill category, abilities that assist allies are in the
support category, and so on.

(Unless otherwise noted, you cannot choose the same ability twice, even
if you get it from both your type and a flavor.)

ABILITY CATEGORIES AND RELATIVE POWER

Abilities can be divided into several categories based on the kinds of
things they do—improve your physical attacks, assist allies, provide
defense, give you a special attack form, and so on. Under each of the
following category descriptions is a list of abilities that fit that
category, sorted into low-, medium-, and high-tier abilities.

The categories are mainly used by GMs when designing new foci for a
campaign, allowing them to search a short list of abilities instead of
trying to find something appropriate among the thousand or so abilities
in this chapter. For example, the GM might have a custom focus in their
campaign called “Is Born of the Swamp” and want a defensive ability for
tier 5, so they can look at the high-tier abilities in the protection
category and quickly narrow down what options are available.

(It may be possible that a character gains the same ability from more
than one source (such as from their type and their descriptor). Unless
the two abilities are obviously additive (such as two abilities that
each add 3 points to your Might Pool, which together would give the
character +6 Might points), the duplicated ability might be improved in
some way, such as having a longer duration or greater effect, or
automatically providing an asset. Some abilities give suggestions on how
to do this; otherwise, the player and the GM should work out whether and
how the ability is improved.)

The ability categories are not intended to be rigid or comprehensive.
Some abilities fall into more than one category, and it could be argued
that some abilities could be included in more categories than are listed
here.

These categories have some overlap with the categories in the Focus
chapter. For example, there is a support category here and a support
category in the Focus chapter. They aren’t intended to be exact
parallels and they don’t mean exactly the same thing. That said, if
you’re creating a support-centric focus, many of the abilities in the
support ability category would be appropriate choices.

ATTACK SKILL

swords or unarmed combat), a category of physical attacks (light bladed,

Abilities—A

A Smile and a Word: When you use Effort on any action involving
interactions—even those having to do with calming animals or
communicating with someone or something whose language you do not
speak—you gain a free level of Effort on the task. Action.

Able Assistance: When you help someone with a task and they apply a
level of Effort, they get a free level of Effort on that task. Enabler.

Absorb Energy (7 Intellect points): You touch an object and absorb its
energy. If you touch a manifest cypher, you render it useless. If you
touch an artifact, roll for its depletion. If you touch another kind of
powered machine or device, the GM determines whether its power is fully
drained. In any case, you absorb energy from the object touched and
regain 1d10 Intellect points. If this would give you more Intellect than
your Pool’s maximum, the extra points are lost, and you must make a
Might defense roll. The difficulty of the roll is equal to the number of
points over your maximum you absorbed. If you fail the roll, you take 5
points of damage and are unable to act for one round. You can use this
ability as a defense action when you’re the target of an incoming
ability. Doing so cancels the incoming ability, and you absorb the
energy as if it were a device. Action.

Absorb Kinetic Energy: You absorb a portion of the energy of a physical
attack or impact. You negate 1 point of damage you would have suffered
and store that point as energy. Once you have absorbed 1 point of
energy, you continue to negate 1 point of damage from any incoming blow
or impact, but the residual energy bleeds off with a flare of harmless
light (you cannot store more than 1 point at a time). Enabler.

Absorb Pure Energy: When you use Absorb Kinetic Energy, you can also
absorb and store energy from attacks made with pure energy (focused
light, radiation, transdimensional, psychic, etc.) or from conduits that
direct energy, if you can make direct contact. This ability does not
change how many points of energy you can store. If you also have
Improved Absorb Kinetic Energy, you can absorb 2 points of damage from
other energy sources as well. Enabler.

Accelerate (4+ Intellect points): Your words imbue the spirit of a
character within immediate range who is able to understand you,
accelerating them so they gain an asset on initiative tasks and Speed
defense rolls for ten minutes. In addition to the normal options for
using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to affect more targets; each
level of Effort affects one additional target. You must speak to
additional targets to accelerate them, one target per round. Action per
target to initiate.

Acrobatic Attack (1+ Speed points): You leap into the attack, twisting
or flipping through the air. If you roll a natural 17 or 18, you can
choose to have a minor effect rather than deal extra damage. If you
apply Effort to the attack, you get a free level of Effort on the task.
You can’t use this ability if your Speed Effort costs are reduced from
wearing armor. Enabler.

Action Processor (4 Intellect points): Drawing upon stored information
and the ability to process incoming data at amazing speeds, you are
trained in one physical task of your choice for ten minutes. For
example, you can choose running, climbing, swimming, Speed defense, or
attacks with a specific weapon. Action to initiate.

Adaptation: Thanks to a latent mutation, a device implanted in your
spine, a ritual performed with dragon’s blood, or some other gift, you
now remain at a comfortable temperature; never need to worry about
dangerous radiation, diseases, or gases; and can always breathe in any
environment (even the vacuum of space). Enabler.

Adroit Cypher Use: You can bear four cyphers at a time. Enabler.

Advanced Command (7 Intellect points): A target within short range obeys
any command you give as long as they can hear and understand you.
Further, as long as you continue to do nothing but issue commands
(taking no other action), you can give that same target a new command.
This effect ends when you stop issuing commands or they are out of short
range. Action to initiate.

Advantage to Disadvantage (3 Speed points): With a number of quick
moves, you make an attack against an armed foe, inflicting damage and
disarming them so that their weapon is now in your hands or 10 feet (3
m) away on the ground—your choice. This disarming attack is hindered.
Action.

Advantages of Being Big: When you use Enlarge, you’re so big that you
can move massive objects more easily, climb buildings by using hand- and
footholds unavailable to regular-sized people, and jump much farther.
While you enjoy the effects of Enlarge, all climbing, lifting, and
jumping tasks are eased. Enabler.

Advantages of Being Small: You’ve learned how to leverage your strength
and accuracy in proportion to your size. Your damage is no longer halved
when using Shrink, and climbing and jumping tasks are eased. Enabler.

Advice From a Friend (1 Intellect point): You know your friend’s
strengths and weaknesses, and how to motivate them to succeed. When you
give an ally a suggestion involving their next action, the character is
trained in that action for one round. Action.

Again and Again (8 Speed points): You can take an additional action in a
round in which you have already acted. Enabler.

Ageless: Your body and mind do not age. Unless you are killed by
violence (or some outside force such as poison or infection), you will
never die. Enabler.

Agent Provocateur: Choose one of the following to be trained in:
attacking with a weapon of your choice, demolitions, or sneaking and
lockpicking (if you choose this last option, you are trained in both).
Enabler.

Aggression (2 Might points): You focus on making attacks to such an
extent that you leave yourself vulnerable to your opponents. While this
ability is active, you gain an asset on your melee attacks, and your
Speed defense rolls against melee and ranged attacks are hindered. This
effect lasts for as long as you wish, but it ends if no combat is taking
place within range of your senses. Enabler.

Agile Wit: When attempting a Speed task, you instead can roll (and spend
points) as if it were an Intellect action. If you apply Effort to this
task, you can spend points from your Intellect Pool instead of your
Speed Pool (in which case you also use your Intellect Edge instead of
your Speed Edge). Enabler.

All-Out Con (7 Intellect points): You put everything into it. You add
three free levels of Effort to the next task you attempt. You can’t use
this ability again until after you’ve taken a  
ten-hour recovery action. Action.

Alleviate (3 Intellect points): You attempt to cancel or cure one malady
(such as disease or poison) in one creature. Action.

Alley Rat (6 Intellect points): While in a city, you find or create a
significant shortcut, secret entrance, or emergency escape route where
it looked like none existed. Doing so requires that you succeed on an
Intellect action whose difficulty is set by the GM based on the
situation. You and the GM should work out the details. Action.

Always Tinkering: If you have any tools and materials at all, and you
are carrying fewer cyphers than your limit, you can create a manifest
cypher if you have an hour of time to spend. The new cypher is random
and always 2 levels lower than normal (minimum 1). It’s also
temperamental and fragile. These are called temperamental cyphers. If
you give one to anyone else to use, it falls apart immediately, useless.
Action to initiate; one hour to complete.

Amazing Copying: You can use Copy Power to copy more powerful abilities.
In addition to the normal options for using Effort with Copy Power, if
you apply two levels of Effort, the GM chooses a high-tier ability that
most closely resembles that power (instead of a low-tier ability).
Enabler.

Amazing Effort: When you apply at least one level of Effort to a
noncombat task, you get a free level of Effort on that task. When you
choose this ability, decide if it applies to Might Effort or Speed
Effort. Enabler.

Amazing Leap (2 Might points): You leap through the air and land safely
some distance away. You can jump up, down, or across to anywhere you
choose within long range if you have a clear and unobstructed path to
that location. If you have three or more power shifts in strength, your
leaping range increases to very long. If you have five or more power
shifts in strength, your leaping range increases to 1,000 feet (300 m).
Action.

Ambusher: When you attack a creature that has not yet acted during the
first round of combat, your attack is eased. Enabler.

Amplify Sounds (2 Might points): For one minute, you can amplify distant
or small sounds so that you can hear them clearly, even if it’s a
conversation or the sound of a small animal moving through an
underground burrow up to a very long distance away. You can attempt to
perceive the sound even if interceding barriers block it or the sound is
very slight, though this requires a few additional rounds of
concentration. To discriminate the sound you wish in a noisy environment
might also require a few additional rounds of concentration as you
audibly explore the surrounding soundscape. Given enough time, you could
pinpoint every conversation, every breathing creature, and every device
creating noise within range. Action to initiate, up to several rounds to
complete, depending on the difficulty of the task.

Anecdote (2 Intellect points): You can lift the spirits of a group of
creatures and help them bond together by entertaining them with an
uplifting or pointed anecdote. For the next hour, those who pay
attention to your story are trained in a task you choose that’s related
to the anecdote, as long as it’s not an attack or defense task. Action
to initiate, one minute to complete.

Animal Scrying (4+ Intellect points): If you know the general location
of an animal that is friendly toward you and within 1 mile (1.5 km) of
your location, you can sense through its senses for up to ten minutes.
If you are not in animal form or not in a form similar to that animal,
you must apply a level of Effort to use this ability. Action to
establish.

Animal Shape (3+ Intellect points): You change into an animal as small
as a rat or up to your own size (such as a large dog or small bear) for
ten minutes. Each time you transform, you can take a different animal
shape. Your equipment becomes part of the transformation, rendering it
unusable unless it has a passive effect, such as armor. In this form
your stats remain the same as your normal form, but you can move and
attack according to your animal shape (attacks from most animals this
size are medium weapons, which you can use without penalty). Tasks
requiring hands (such as using door handles or pushing buttons) are
hindered when in animal form. You cannot speak but can still use
abilities that don’t rely on human speech. You gain two minor abilities
associated with the creature you become (see the Animal Form Minor
Abilities table at the end of the Character Abilities section of this
document). For example, if you transform into a bat, you become trained
in perception and can fly up to a long distance each round. If you
transform into an octopus, you are trained in stealth and can breathe
underwater. If you apply a level of Effort when you use this ability,
you can either become a talking animal or take a hybrid shape. The
talking animal shape looks exactly like a normal animal, but you can
still talk and use any abilities that rely on human speech. The hybrid
shape is like your normal form but with animalistic features, even if
that animal is something much smaller than you (such as a bat or rat).
In this hybrid form you can speak, use all of your abilities, make
attacks like an animal, and perform tasks using hands without being
hindered. Anyone who sees you clearly in this hybrid form would never
mistake you for a mere animal. Action to change or revert. 

“Similar” is a broad term. Lions are similar to tigers and leopards,
hawks are similar to ravens and swans, dogs are similar to wolves and
foxes, and so on.

Even if your animal shape has multiple attack types (such as claws and
bite), you can attack only once per round unless you have some other
ability that lets you make additional attacks on your turn.

Animal Shape variant: If your character concept is that you always take
the same animal form instead of being able to choose from multiple kinds
of animals, double the duration of the Animal Shape ability (to twenty
minutes per use). The GM may allow characters with this restriction to
learn additional animal forms by spending 4 XP as a long-term benefit.

ANIMAL FORM MINOR ABILITIES TABLE

Use the following as examples or suggestions of what a character gains
when in the shape of an animal. If an animal shape lists two skills, the
character chooses which one they want each time they take that shape.

| Animal            | Skill Training         | Other Abilities |
|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Ape               | Climbing               | Hands           |

| Dolphin           | Perception or swimming | Fast            |
| Fish              | Stealth or swimming    | Aquatic         |
| Frog              | Jumping or stealth     | Aquatic         |

| Shark             | Swimming               | Aquatic         |
| Turtle            | Might defense          | Armor           |
| Venomous snake    | Climbing               | Venom           |
| Wolf              | Perception             | Scent           |

Aquatic: The animal either breathes water instead of air or is able to
breathe water in addition to breathing air.

Armor: The animal has a thick hide or shell, granting +1 to Armor.

Constrict: The animal can grip its opponent fast after making a melee
attack (usually with a bite or claw), easing attack rolls against that
foe on later turns until it releases the foe.

Fast: The animal can move a long distance on its turn instead of a short
distance.

Flying: The animal can fly, which (depending on the type of animal) may
be up to a short or long distance on its turn.

Hands: The animal has paws or hands that are nearly as agile as those of
a human. Unlike with most animal shapes, the animal’s tasks that require
hands are not hindered (although the GM may decide that some tasks
requiring human agility, such as playing a flute, are still hindered).

Scent: The animal has a strong sense of smell, gaining an asset on
tracking and dealing with darkness or blindness.

Small: The animal is considerably smaller than a human, easing its Speed
defense tasks but hindering tasks to move heavy things.

Venom: The animal is poisonous (usually through a bite), inflicting 1
additional point of damage.

Animal Senses and Sensibilities: You are trained in listening and
spotting things. In addition, most of the time, the GM should alert you
if you’re about to walk into an ambush or a trap that is lower than
level 5. Enabler.

Answering Attack (3 Speed points): If you are struck in melee, you can
make an immediate melee attack against that attacker once per round. The
attack is hindered, and you can still take your normal action during the
round. Enabler.

Anticipate Attack (4 Intellect points): You can sense when and how
creatures attacking you will make their attacks. Speed defense rolls are
eased for one minute. Action.

Anticipation (1 Intellect point): You look ahead to see how your actions
might unfold. The first task you perform before the end of the next
round gains an asset. Action.

Automatic Glow: Hard light objects you create with your type and focus
abilities shed light, illuminating everything in immediate range.
Whenever you want, your body (entirely or just part of it) sheds light,
illuminating everything in short range. Enabler.

Applying Your Knowledge: When you help another character undertake any
action that you’re untrained in, you are treated as if you are trained
in it. Action.

Apportation (4 Intellect points): You call a physical object to you. You
can choose any piece of normal equipment on the standard equipment list,
or (no more than once per day) you can allow the GM to determine the
object randomly. If you call a random object, it has a 10 percent chance
of being a manifest cypher or artifact, a 50 percent chance of being a
piece of standard equipment, and a 40 percent chance of being a bit of
worthless junk. You can’t use this ability to take an item held by
another creature. Action.

Aquatic Combatant: You ignore penalties for any action (including
fighting) in underwater environments. Enabler.

Arc Spray (3 Speed points): If a weapon has the ability to fire rapid
shots without reloading (usually called a rapid-fire weapon, such as a
crank crossbow), you can fire your weapon at up to three targets (all
next to one another) at once. Make a separate attack roll against each
target. Each attack is hindered. Action.

Arcane Flare (1 Intellect point): You enhance the damage of another
attack spell with an extra charge of energy so that it deals 1
additional point of damage. Alternatively, you attack a target within
long range by projecting a flare of raw magic that inflicts 4 points of
damage. Enabler for enhancement; action for long-range attack.

Artifact Scavenger (6 Intellect points + 2 XP): You’ve developed a sixth
sense for searching for the most valuable items in the wasteland. If you
spend the time required to succeed on two scavenging tasks, you can
exchange all the results you would otherwise obtain for a chance to gain
an artifact of the GM’s choosing if you succeed on a difficulty 6
Intellect task. You can use this ability at most once per day, and never
within the same general area. Action to initiate, several hours to
complete.

Artifact Tinkerer: If you spend at least one day tinkering with an
artifact in your possession, it functions at one level higher than
normal. This applies to all artifacts in your possession, but they
retain this bonus only for you. Enabler.

As Foretold in Prophecy: You accomplish something that proves you are
truly the chosen one. The next task you attempt is eased by three steps.
You can’t use this ability again until after you’ve taken a one-hour or
a ten-hour recovery action. Action.

As If One Creature: When you and your beast (from your Beast Companion
ability) are within immediate distance of each other, you can share
damage inflicted on either of you. For instance, if one of you is struck
by a weapon for 4 points of damage, divide the damage between the two of
you as you see fit. Only the Armor and resistances of the target
initially damaged come into play. So if you have 2 Armor and are struck
by a force blast for 4 points of damage, your beast can take the 2
points of damage you would suffer, but their Armor does not come into
play, nor does their immunity to force blasts, if any. Enabler.

Assassin Skills: You are trained in stealth and disguise tasks. Enabler.

Assassin Strike (5 Intellect points): If you successfully attack a
creature that was previously unaware of your presence, you deal 9
additional points of damage. Enabler.

Asserting Your Privilege (3 Intellect points): Acting as only a
privileged person can, you verbally harangue a foe who can hear and
understand you so forcefully that they are unable to take any action,
including attacks, for one round. Whether you succeed or fail, the next
action the target takes is hindered. Action.

Assume Control (6+ Intellect points): You control the actions of another
creature you have interacted with or studied for at least a round. This
effect lasts for ten minutes. The target must be level 2 or lower. Once
you have assumed control, the target acts as if it wants to accomplish
your desire to the best of its ability, freely using its own best
judgment unless you use an action to give it a specific instruction on
an issue-by-issue basis. In addition to the normal options for using
Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of
the target. Thus, to attempt to command a level 5 target (three levels
above the normal limit), you must apply three levels of Effort. When the
effect ends, the target remembers everything that happened and reacts
according to its nature and your relationship to it; assuming control
might have soured that relationship if it was previously a positive one.
Action to initiate.

Athlete: You are trained in carrying, climbing, jumping, and smashing.
Enabler.

Attack and Attack Again: Rather than granting additional damage or a
minor or major effect, a natural 17 or higher on your attack roll allows
you the option of immediately making another attack. Enabler.

Attack Flourish: With your attack, you add stylish moves, entertaining
quips, or a certain something that entertains or impresses others. One
creature you choose within short range who can see you gains an asset to
its next task if taken within a round or two. Enabler.

Augment Cypher (2+ Intellect points): When you activate a cypher, add +1
to its level. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you
can choose to use Effort to increase the level of the cypher by an
additional +1 (per level of Effort applied). You can’t increase the
cypher’s level above 10. Enabler.

Autodoctor: You are trained in healing, performing surgical procedures,
and withstanding pain. You can perform surgeries on yourself, remaining
conscious while you do so. Enabler.

Awareness (3 Intellect points): You become hyperaware of your
surroundings in order to better locate your target. For ten minutes, you
are aware of all living things within long range (including their
general position), and by concentrating (another action), you can
attempt to learn the general health and power level of any one of them.
Action.

Abilities—B

Babel: After hearing a language spoken for a few minutes, you can speak
it and make yourself understood. If you continue to use the language to
interact with native speakers, your skills improve rapidly, to the point
where you might be mistaken for a native speaker after just a few hours
of speaking the new language. Enabler.

Balance: You are trained in balancing. Enabler.

Band of Desperados: Your reputation draws a band of six level 2
desperado NPC followers who are completely devoted to you. You and the
GM must work out the details of these followers. If a follower dies, you
gain a new one after at least two weeks and proper recruitment. Enabler.

Band of Followers: You gain four level 3 followers. They are not
restricted on their modifications. Enabler.

Bash (1 Might point): This is a pummeling melee attack. Your attack
inflicts 1 less point of damage than normal, but dazes your target for
one round, during which time all tasks it performs are hindered. Action.

Basic Follower: You gain a level 2 follower. One of their modifications
must be persuasion. You can take this ability multiple times, each time
gaining another level 2 follower. Enabler. (When you use Basic Follower,
the GM may require that you actually look for a suitable follower.)

Battle Management (4 Intellect points): As long as you use your action
each round giving orders or advice, attack and defense actions taken by
your allies within short range are eased. Action.

Battlefield Tactician (2+ Intellect points): You scrutinize your
surroundings, learning whatever facts the GM feels are pertinent about
attacking, defending, maneuvering, and dealing with environmental
hazards within a short distance. For example, you might notice a pile of
rubble you can stand on for an advantage in melee, a sheltered corner to
help protect against enemy attacks, a less-slippery part of a frozen
lake, or a place where the poison gas is thinner than elsewhere. If you
(or someone you tell) move to that location, you (or they) gain an asset
on tasks related to that optimal position (such as attack rolls from the
high ground, Speed defense rolls from the sheltered corner, balance
rolls on the frozen lake, or Might defense rolls against the poisonous
cloud). Instead of gaining an advantageous location, you might learn of
a disadvantageous location that you could use against your enemies, such
as maneuvering them into an awkward corner that hinders their melee
attacks or a weak spot on the frozen lake that will break if they stand
on it. You can apply Effort to learn one additional good or bad location
within range (one location per level of Effort), increase the range of
this ability (another short distance per level of Effort), or both.
Enabler.

Beast Call (5 Intellect points): You summon a horde of small animals or
a single level 4 beast to help you temporarily. These creatures do your
bidding for as long as you focus your attention, but you must use your
action each turn to direct them. Creatures are native to the area and
arrive under their own power, so if you’re in an unreachable place, this
ability won’t work. Action.

Beast Companion: A level 2 creature of your size or smaller accompanies
you and follows your instructions. You and the GM must work out the
details of your creature, and you’ll probably make rolls for it in
combat or when it takes actions. The beast companion acts on your turn.
As a level 2 creature, it has a target number of 6 and 6 health and it
inflicts 2 points of damage. Its movement is based on its creature type
(avian, swimmer, and so on). If your beast companion dies, you can hunt
in the wild for 1d6 days to find a new one. Enabler. (A creature’s level
determines its target number, health, and

damage, unless otherwise stated. So a level 2 beast companion has a
target number of 6 and a health of 6, and it inflicts 2 points of
damage. A level 4 beast companion has a target number of 12 and a health
of 12, and it inflicts 4 points of damage. And so on.)

Beast Eyes (3 Intellect points): By linking to the creature from your
Beast Companion ability, you can perceive through its senses if it is
within 1 mile (1.5 km) of you. This effect lasts up to ten minutes.
Action to establish.

Beast Form: On five consecutive nights each month, you change into a
monstrous beast for up to one hour each night. In this new form, you
gain +8 to your Might Pool, +1 to your Might Edge, +2 to your Speed
Pool, and +1 to your Speed Edge. While in beast form, you can’t spend
Intellect points for any reason other than to try to change to your
normal form before the one-hour duration is over (a difficulty 2 task).
In addition, you attack any and every living creature within short
range. After you revert to your normal form, you take a –1 penalty to
all rolls for one hour. If you did not kill and eat at least one
substantial creature while in beast form, the penalty increases to –2
and affects all your rolls for the next 24 hours. Action to change back.

Beneath Notice: Your decreased size makes it difficult to find you.
While Shrink is active on you, all stealth tasks you attempt are eased.
Enabler.

Bestiary Knowledge: You are trained in the lore of flesh-eating,
nonhumanoid creatures—recognizing them, knowing their weaknesses, and
knowing their habits and behaviors. Enabler.

Betrayal: Any time you convince a foe that you are not a threat and then
suddenly attack it (without provocation), the attack deals 4 additional
points of damage. Enabler.

Better Living Through Chemistry (4 Intellect points): You’ve developed
drug cocktails specifically designed to work with your own biochemistry.
Depending on which one you inject, it makes you smarter, faster, or
tougher, but when it wears off, the crash is a doozy, so you use it only
in desperate situations. You gain 2 to your Might Edge, Speed Edge, or
Intellect Edge for one minute, after which you can’t gain the benefit
again for one hour. During this follow-up hour, every time you spend
points from a Pool, increase the cost by 1. Action.

Better Surprise Attack: If attacking from a hidden vantage, with
surprise, or before an opponent has acted, you get an asset on the
attack (if you have Surprise Attack, this is in addition to the asset
from that ability). On a successful hit with this surprise attack, you
inflict 2 additional points of damage (for a total of 4 additional
points of damage if you have Surprise Attack). Enabler.

Bigger: When you use Enlarge, you can choose to grow up to 12 feet (4 m)
in height, and you add 3 more temporary points to your Might Pool.
Enabler.

Bigger Animal Shape: When you use Animal Shape, your animal form grows
to about twice its normal size. Being so large, your beast form gains
the following additional bonuses: +1 to Armor, +5 to your Might Pool,
and you are trained in using your animal form’s natural attacks as heavy
weapons (if you weren’t already). However, your Speed defense tasks are
hindered. While bigger, you also gain an asset to tasks that are easier
for a larger creature to perform, like climbing, intimidating, wading
rivers, and so on. Enabler. 

Bigger Beast Form: When you use Beast Form, your beast form grows bigger
than before, during which time you achieve a height of 12 feet (4 m).  
Being so large, your beast form gains the following additional bonuses:
+1 to Armor, +5 to your Might Pool, and you are trained in using your
fists as heavy weapons (if you weren’t already). However, your Speed
defense tasks are hindered. While bigger, you also gain an asset to
tasks that are easier for a larger creature to perform, like climbing,
intimidating, wading rivers, and so on. Enabler.

Biomorphic Detonation (7+ Might points): You radiate a pulse of
biomorphic energy up to a short distance away, but you tune it to
disrupt life in an area an immediate distance across. All within the
detonation take 5 points of damage that ignores Armor (unless it is
Armor provided by a force field effect). If you apply additional Effort
to increase the damage, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level
of Effort (instead of 3 points); targets in the area take 1 point of
damage even if you fail the attack roll. Action.

Biomorphic Healing (4+ Might points): You consciously send out a pulse
of your biomorphic field (a strange energy your body generates) and
focus it on a living creature within short range. The target gains a
free and immediate one-action recovery roll. You can’t use this ability
again on that creature until after its next ten-hour rest. Action.

Blameless: You are trained in one of the following: deception, stealth,
or disguise. Enabler.

Blend In (4 Intellect points): When you blend in, creatures still see
you, but they attach no importance to your presence for about a minute.
While blending in, you are specialized in stealth and Speed defense
tasks. This effect ends if you do something to reveal your presence or
position—attacking, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on.
If this occurs, you can regain the remaining period of effect by taking
an action to focus on seeming innocuous and as if you belong. Action to
initiate or reinitiate.

Blessing of the Gods: As a servant of the gods, you can call up
blessings in their name. This blessing depends on the god’s general
demeanor and area of influence. Choose two of the abilities described
below.

*Authority/Law/Peace (3 Intellect points).* You prevent a foe that can
hear and understand you from attacking anyone or anything for one round.
Action.

*Benevolence/Righteousness/Spirit (2+ Intellect points).* One level 1
demon, spirit, or similar creature within short range is destroyed or
banished. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can
choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus,
to destroy or banish a level 5 target (four levels above the normal
limit), you must apply four levels of Effort. Action.

*Death/Darkness (2 Intellect points).* A target you choose within short
range withers, suffering 3 points of damage. Action.

*Desire/Love/Health (3 Intellect points).* With a touch, you restore 1d6
points to one stat Pool of any creature, including yourself. This
ability is a difficulty 2 Intellect task. Each time you attempt to heal
the same creature, the task is hindered by an additional step. The
difficulty returns to 2 after that creature rests for ten hours. Action.

*Earth/Stone.* You are trained in climbing, stonecraft, and spelunking.
Enabler.

*Knowledge/Wisdom (3 Intellect points).* Choose up to three creatures
(potentially including yourself). For one minute, a particular type of
task (but not an attack roll or defense roll) is eased for those
creatures, but only while they remain within immediate range of you.
Action.

*Nature/Animals/Plants.* You are trained in botany and handling natural
animals. Enabler.

*Protection/Silence (3 Intellect points).* You create a quiet bubble of
protection around you to an immediate radius for one minute. The bubble
moves with you. All defense rolls for you and all creatures you
designate within the bubble are eased, and no noise, regardless of its
origin, sounds louder than a normal speaking voice. Action to initiate.

*Sky/Air (2 Intellect points).* A creature you touch is immune to
airborne toxins or contaminants for ten minutes. Action.

*Sun/Light/Fire (2 Intellect points).* You cause one creature or object
within short range to catch fire, inflicting 1 point of ambient damage
each round until the fire is extinguished (requiring an action). Action.

*Trickery/Greed/Commerce.* You are trained in detecting the deceptions
of other creatures. Enabler.

*War (1 Intellect point).* A target you choose within short range
(potentially yourself) deals 2 additional points of damage with its next
successful weapon attack. Action.

*Water/Sea (2 Intellect points).* A target you touch can breathe water
for ten minutes. Action.

Blind Machine (6 Speed points): You deactivate the sensory apparatus of
a machine, making it effectively blind until it can be repaired. You
must either touch the target or strike it with a ranged attack
(inflicting no damage). Action.

Blinding Attack (3 Speed points): If you have a source of light, you can
use it to make a melee attack against a target. If successful, the
attack deals no damage, but the target is blinded for one minute.
Action.

Blink of an Eye (4 Speed points): You move up to 1,000 feet (300 m) in
one round. Action.

Block (3 Speed points): You automatically block the next melee attack
made against you within the next minute. Action to initiate.

Block for Another: If you use a light or medium weapon, you can block
attacks made against an ally near you. Choose one creature within
immediate range. You provide an asset to that creature’s Speed defense
tasks. You can’t use Quick Block while using Block for Another. Enabler.

Blood Fever: When you have no points in one or two Pools, you gain an
asset to attacks or defense rolls (your choice). Enabler.

Bloodlust (3 Might points): If you take down a foe, you can move a short
distance, but only if you move toward another foe. You don’t need to
spend the points until you know that the first foe is down. Enabler.

Blurring Speed (7 Speed points): You move so quickly that until your
next turn, you look like a blur. While you are blurred, if you apply
Effort to a melee attack task or Speed defense task, you get a free
level of Effort on that task; you can move a short distance as part of
another action or a long distance as your entire action. Enabler.

Body Morph (3+ Intellect points): You alter your facial and bodily
features and coloration for one hour, hiding your identity or
impersonating someone. If you apply a level of Effort, you can imitate a
specific person accurately enough to fool someone who knows them well or
has observed them closely (including fingerprints and voice prints, but
not their retina print or DNA). You have an asset in all tasks involving
disguise (this is in addition to the asset from Face Morph). You must
apply a separate level of Effort to be able to impersonate a different
species (such as a human morphing into a humanoid alien). Action.

Bolt Rider (4 Intellect points): You can move a long distance from one
location to another almost instantaneously, carried by a bolt of
lightning. You must be able to see the new location, and there must be
no intervening barriers. Action.

Bolts of Power (5+ Intellect points): You blast a fan of lightning out
to short range in an arc that is approximately 50 feet (15 m) wide at
the end. This discharge inflicts 4 points of damage. If you apply Effort
to increase the damage rather than to ease the task, you deal 2
additional points of damage per level of Effort (instead of 3 points);
targets in the area take 1 point of damage even if you fail the attack
roll. Action.

 Bolster Illusion (2+ Intellect points): You give one of your visual
illusions a limited physical reality that viewers can smell, taste,
hear, and feel. This effect is bound to that illusion and acts
appropriate to the illusion itself. For example, it can make the
illusion of a brick wall feel like brick, the illusion of a person smell
like perfume and able to open a door, and the illusion of a fireplace
hot to the touch.

The physical reality provided to your illusion is a level 1 effect with
3 health. If the illusion is used to make attacks, it inflicts only 1
point of damage (whether this is regular damage like an illusory punch
or kick, or ambient damage like a falling brick wall or a fireplace’s
flames). You can increase the level of the created effect by applying
levels of Effort to this ability, each level of Effort increasing the
effect’s level by 1.

You can activate this ability as part of the action to create an
illusion (using whatever ability it is that you use to create illusions,
such as Minor Illusion), or use a separate action to apply it to one of
your existing illusions. The effect ends if the illusion is destroyed,
you let the illusion lapse, the effect’s health is reduced to 0, or ten
minutes pass. Enabler.

Boost Manifest Cypher (2 Intellect points): The manifest cypher you
activate with your next action functions as if it were 2 levels higher.
Action.

Boost Manifest Cypher Function (4 Intellect points): Add 3 to the
functioning level of a manifest cypher that you activate with your next
action, or change one aspect of its parameters (range, duration, area,
etc.) by up to double or down to one tenth. Action.

Bouncing Shield: When you use Throw Force Shield, instead of dissipating
after one attack (whether it hits or misses), it will attack up to two
additional targets within short range. Effort or other modifiers applied
to the first attack affect all other targets as well. Whether you hit
all, some, or none of your targets, the shield dissipates and then
reforms in your grasp. (If you choose Bouncing Shield and have
previously taken the Throw Force Shield ability, you have the option to
exchange that ability for Healing Pulse.) Enabler.

Bound Magic Creature: You have a level 3 magic ally bound to a physical
object (perhaps a minor djinn bound to a lamp, a lesser demon bound to a
coin, or a spirit bound to a mirror). The magic ally doesn’t yet have
the full power that one of its kind could possess when mature. Normally,
the ally remains quiescent in its bound object. When you use an action
to manifest it, it appears next to you as a creature that can converse
with you. The creature has its own personality determined by the GM and
is a level higher than its base level for one area of knowledge (such as
local history). The GM determines whether the magic ally has a long-term
goal of its own.

Each time the magic ally becomes physically manifest, it remains so for
up to one hour. During that period, it accompanies you and follows your
instructions. The magic ally must remain an immediate distance from you;
if it moves farther away, it is yanked back into its object at the end
of your following turn and cannot return until after your next ten-hour
recovery roll. It doesn’t attack creatures, but it can use its action to
serve as an asset for any one attack you make on your turn. Otherwise,
it can take actions on its own (though you’ll likely roll for it).

If the creature is reduced to 0 health, it dissipates. It reforms in its
object in 1d6 + 2 days.

If you lose the bound object, you retain a sense of the direction in
which it lies. Action to manifest the magic creature.

Brainwashing (6+ Intellect points): You use trickery, well-spoken lies,
and mind-affecting chemicals (or other means, like magic or high
technology) to make others temporarily do what you want them to do. You
control the actions of another creature you touch. This effect lasts for
one minute. The target must be level 3 or lower. You can allow it to act
freely or override its control on a case-by-case basis as long as you
can see it. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can
choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target or
increase the duration by one minute. Thus, to control the mind of a
level 6 target (three levels above the normal limit) or control a target
for four minutes (three minutes above the normal duration), you must
apply three levels of Effort. When the duration ends, the creature
doesn’t remember being controlled or anything it did while under your
influence. Action to initiate.

Break the Line (4 Intellect points): You have an eye for group
discipline and hierarchy, even among your foes. If a group of foes is
gaining any kind of benefit from working together, you can attempt to
disrupt that benefit by pointing out the weak spot in the enemy’s line,
formation, or swarm attack. This effect lasts for up to a minute or
until all the affected foes spend a round assessing and resetting
themselves to regain their normal advantage. Action to initiate.

Break the Ranks (6 Speed points): You move up to a short distance and
attack up to four different foes as a single action as long as they are
all along your path. Any modifiers that apply to one attack apply to all
the attacks you make. If you have another special ability that allows
you to move and take an action, when you use Break the Ranks, you gain
an asset to attacking these foes. Action.

Break Their Mind (7+ Intellect points): Using your clever words and
knowledge of others, and given a couple of rounds of conversation to
gain a few specific pieces of context regarding your target, you can
utter a sentence designed to cause your target immediate psychological
distress. If the target can hear and understand you, it suffers 6 points
of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) and forgets the last day of its
life, which might mean it forgets you and how it came to be where it
currently is. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you
can choose to use Effort to attempt to break the mind of one additional
target who can hear and understand you. Action to initiate, action to
complete.

Breaker: You are trained in tasks related to damaging objects with the
goal of breaking, piercing, or demolishing them. It is a Might action to
damage an object, and on a success, the object moves one step down the
object damage track. If the Might roll exceeds the difficulty by two
steps, the object instead moves two steps down the object damage track.
If the Might roll exceeds the difficulty by four steps, the object moves
three steps down the object damage track and is immediately destroyed.
Brittle material reduces the effective level of the object, while hard
material like wood or stone adds 1 to the effective level or 2 for very
hard objects like those made of metal. Enabler.

Brute Strike (4 Might points): You deal 4 additional points of damage
with all melee attacks until the end of the next round. Enabler.

Buddy System (3 Intellect points): Choose one character standing next to
you. That character becomes your buddy for ten minutes. You are trained
in all tasks involving finding, healing, interacting with, and
protecting your buddy. Also, while you stand next to your buddy, both of
you have an asset on Speed defense tasks. You can have only one buddy at
a time. Action to initiate.

Built-in Weaponry: Biomechanical implants, a magical jewel fused to your
forehead, or something just as wild now provides you with inherent
weaponry. This allows you to fire a blast of energy up to long range
that inflicts 5 points of damage. There is no cost for you to use this
ability. Action.

Burning Light (3 Intellect points): You send a beam of light at a
creature within long range and then tighten the beam until it burns,
inflicting 5 points of damage. Action.

Burst of Escape (5 Speed points): You can take two separate actions this
round, as long as one of them is to hide or to move in a direction that
is not toward a foe. Enabler.

Bypass Barrier (6+ Intellect points): You get past a door, force field,
or other barrier up to 3 feet (1 m)  
thick that is blocking your way. Depending on the barrier, this might
involve finding a weak spot you can push through, pressing the right
button by luck, just breaking through, or even weirder explanations like
touching a thin place between dimensions or an unexpected interaction
with your equipment. The difficulty of the task is the level of the
barrier. This ability allows you alone to pass through, not anyone else,
and the way through closes at the end of your turn (which might mean
you’re trapped on the far side). You have an asset in any attempts to
get through it again. In addition to the normal options for using
Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum thickness
of the barrier, each level adding 3 feet (1 m). Action.

Abilities—C

Call Dead Spirit (6 Intellect points): At your touch, the remains of a
creature dead no longer than seven days appears as a manifest (and
apparently physical) spirit, whose level is the same as it had in life.
The raised spirit persists for up to a day (or less, if it accomplishes
something important to it before then), after which it fades away and
cannot return again.

The raised spirit remembers everything it knew in life and possesses
most of its previous abilities (though not necessarily its equipment).
In addition, it gains the ability to become insubstantial as an action
for up to a minute at a time. The raised spirit is not beholden to you,
and it does not need to stay near you to remain manifest. Action to
initiate.

Call in Favor (4 Intellect points): A guard, doctor, technician, or
hired thug in the employ of or allied with a foe is secretly your ally
or owes you a favor. When you call in the favor, the target does what
they can to help you out of a specific fix (unties you, slips you a
knife, leaves a cell door unlocked) in a way that minimizes their risk
of revealing their divided loyalties to their employer or other allies.
This ability is a difficulty 3 Intellect task. Each additional time you
use this ability, the task is hindered by an additional step. The
difficulty returns to 3 after you rest for ten hours. Action.

Call Otherworldly Spirit (6 Intellect points): You summon a spirit
creature that manifests for up to a day (or less, if it accomplishes
something important to it before then), after which it fades away and
cannot be summoned again. The spirit is a creature of level 6 or lower,
and it can be substantial or insubstantial as it wishes (using an action
to change). The spirit is not beholden to you, and it does not need to
stay near you to remain manifest. Action to initiate.

Call the Storm (7+ Intellect points): If you are outside or in a
location that has a ceiling at least 300 feet (90 m) above the floor,
you summon a boiling layer of lightning-lit, rumbling clouds up to 1,500
feet (460 m) in diameter for ten minutes. During daylight hours, natural
illumination beneath the storm is reduced to dim light. While the storm
rages, you can use an action to send a lightning bolt from the cloud to
attack a target you can see directly, inflicting 4 points of damage (you
can spend Effort normally on each individual lightning bolt attack).
Three actions to initiate; action to call down a lightning strike.

Call Swarm (4 Intellect points): If you’re in a location where it’s
possible for the creatures from your Influence Swarm ability to come,
you call a swarm of them for one hour. During this hour, they do as you
telepathically command as long as they are within long range. They can
swarm about and hinder any or all opponents’ tasks. While the creatures
are in long range, you can speak to them telepathically and perceive
through their senses. Action to initiate.

Call Through Time (6+ Intellect points): You call a creature or person
of up to level 3 from the recent past, and it appears next to you. You
can choose a creature that you’ve previously encountered (even if it is
now dead), or (no more than once per day) you can allow the GM to
determine the creature randomly. If you call a random creature, it has a
10 percent chance of being a creature of up to level 5. The creature has
no memory of anything before being called by you, though it can speak
and has the general knowledge a creature of its type should possess. The
time-shifted creature does your bidding for as long as you concentrate
on it, but you must use your action each turn to direct it; otherwise it
returns to the past.

In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to
use Effort to call a more powerful creature; each level of Effort used
in this way increases the creature’s level by 1. For example, applying
one level of Effort calls a specific creature of up to level 4 or a
random creature with a 10 percent chance of being up to level 6. Action.

Calm (3 Intellect points): Through jokes, song, or other art, you
prevent a living foe from attacking anyone or anything for one round.
Action.

Calm Stranger (2+ Intellect points): You can cause one intelligent
creature to remain calm as you speak. The creature doesn’t need to speak
your language, but it must be able to see you. It remains calm as long
as you focus all your attention on it and it is not attacked or
otherwise threatened. In addition to the normal options for using
Effort, you can choose to use Effort to calm additional creatures allied
with your initial target, one additional creature per level of Effort
applied. Action.

Capable Warrior: Your attacks deal 1 additional point of damage.
Enabler.

Captivate or Inspire: You can use this ability in one of two ways.
Either your words keep the attention of all NPCs that hear them for as
long as you speak, or your words inspire all NPCs that hear them to
function as if they were one level higher for the next hour. In either
case, you choose which NPCs are affected. If anyone in the crowd is
attacked while you’re trying to speak to them, you lose the crowd’s
attention. Action to initiate.

Captivate With Starshine: For as long as you speak, you keep the
attention of all level 2 or lower NPCs who can hear you. If you also
have the Enthrall ability, you can similarly captivate all level 3 NPCs.
Action to initiate.

Car Surfer: You can stand or move about on a moving vehicle (such as on
the hood, on the roof, in the open door well, etc.) with a reasonable
expectation of not falling off. Unless the vehicle veers sharply, stops
suddenly, or otherwise engages in extreme maneuvers, standing or moving
about on a moving vehicle is a routine task for you. If the vehicle
engages in extreme maneuvers like those described, any tasks to remain
on the vehicle’s surface are eased. Enabler.

Careful Aim: You are trained in attacks with all weapons that you throw.
Enabler.

Careful Shot: You can spend points from either your Speed Pool or your
Intellect Pool to apply levels of Effort to increase your gun damage.
Each level of Effort adds 3 points of damage to a successful attack, and
if you spend a turn lining up your shot, each level of Effort instead
adds 5 points of damage to a successful attack. Enabler.

Cast Illusion: You can increase the range at which you create and
maintain your  
immediate-range illusions (such as from Minor Illusion) to anywhere
within short range that you can perceive. Enabler.

Castigate (4 Intellect points): You intimidate any opponent within long
range who understands speech (even if it is not your language) so much
that they lose their next action and all the rest of their actions are
hindered for one minute. Each additional time you attempt this ability
against the same target, you must apply one more level of Effort than
you applied on the previous attempt. Action.

Celebrity Talent: You are trained in two of the following areas:
writing, journalism, a particular style of art, a particular sport,
chess, science communication, acting, news presentation, or some related
noncombat skill that led to your celebrity. Enabler.

Center of Attention (5 Intellect points): A literal (or metaphorical,
depending on the genre) beam of pure radiance descends from on high and
spotlights you. All creatures you choose within immediate range fall to
their knees and lose their next action. Affected targets cannot defend
themselves and are treated as helpless. Action.

Chamber of Dreams (8 Intellect points): You and your allies can step
into a chamber of dreams, decorated as you wish, that contains a number
of doors. The doors correspond with other locations that you have
visited or know reasonably well. Stepping through one of the doors
delivers you to the desired location. This is a difficulty 2
Intellect-based task (which could be modified upward by the GM if the
location is warded). Action to step into chamber of dreams; action to
move through a door in the chamber.

Change the Paradigm (6+ Intellect points): You sway the worldview of a
creature you spend at least one round speaking to, as long as it can
understand you. The creature changes its mind on a significant belief,
which could include something as straightforward as helping you instead
of trying to kill you, or it could be something more esoteric. This
effect lasts for at least ten minutes, but it can last longer if the
creature wasn’t previously your foe. During this time, the creature
takes actions in accordance with the wisdom you have imparted to it. The
target must be level 2 or lower. In addition to the normal options for
using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level
of the target by one for each level of Effort applied. Action to
initiate.

Charge (1+ Intellect points): You can charge an artifact or other device
(except a cypher) so that it can be used once. The cost is 1 Intellect
point plus 1 point per level of the device. Action.

Charge Weapon (2+ Intellect points): As part of making an attack with
your enchanted weapon, you charge it with magical power, inflicting 2
additional points of energy damage. If you make more than one attack on
your turn, you choose whether to spend the cost for this ability before
you make each attack. Enabler. 

Charging Horde (7 Might points): You and two or more of your followers
next to you can act like a single creature to make a charge attack. When
you do, all of you move up to a short distance, during which time you
can attack anything that comes within immediate range along your path
with an asset to the attack. Targets that take damage take an additional
3 points and are knocked prone. Action.

Charm Machine (2 Intellect points): You convince an unintelligent
machine to “like” you. A machine that likes you is 50 percent less
likely to function if said function would cause you harm. Thus, if a foe
attempts to detonate a bomb near you controlled by a detonator that
likes you, there is a 50 percent chance that it won’t explode. Action to
initiate.

Cloak of Opportunity (5 Intellect points): You set small objects from
the environment (rocks, broken items, clumps of dirt, and so on)
swirling about you for up to ten minutes, which grants you +2 Armor.
Action to initiate.

Closed Mind: You are trained in Intellect defense tasks and have +2
Armor against damage that selectively targets your Intellect Pool (which
normally ignores Armor). Enabler.

Cloud Personal Memories (3 Intellect points): If you interact with or
study a target for at least a round, you gain a sense of how its mind
works, which you can use against it in the most blunt fashion possible.
You can attempt to confuse it and make it forget what’s just happened.
On a success, you erase up to the last five minutes of its memory.
Action to prepare; action to initiate.

Coaxing Power (2 Intellect points): You boost the power or function of a
machine so that it operates at one level higher than normal for one
hour. Action to initiate.

Cognizant Offense: During combat, your brain shifts into a sort of
battle mode where all potential attacks you could make are plotted on
vector graphs in your mind’s eye, which always provides the best option.
Your attacks are eased. Enabler.

Cold Burst (5+ Intellect points): You emit a burst of cold in all
directions, up to short range. All within the burst (except you) take 5
points of damage. If you apply Effort to increase the damage rather than
to ease the task, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level of
Effort (instead of 3 points); targets in the area take 1 point of damage
even if you fail the attack roll. Action.

Colossal: When you use Enlarge, you can choose to grow up to a base
height of 60 feet (18 m). When you do, you add 5 more temporary points
to your Might Pool (plus any from Gargantuan and Bigger), and you deal
an additional 2 points of damage with melee attacks (plus any from your
Huge ability). For each level of Effort you apply to increase your
height further, your total height increases by 10 feet  
(3 m), and you add 1 more point to your Might Pool. Thus, the first time
you use Enlarge after a ten-hour recovery roll, if you apply two levels
of Effort, your base height is 80 feet (24 m), and you add a total of 17
temporary points to your Might Pool. Enabler.

Combat Challenge: All attempted tasks that draw an attack to yourself
(and away from someone else) are eased by two steps. Enabler.

Combat Prowess: You add +1 damage to one type of weapon attack of your
choice: melee weapon attacks or ranged weapon attacks. Enabler.

Command (3 Intellect points): Through sheer force of will, you can issue
a simple imperative command to a single living creature, who then
attempts to carry out your command as its next action. The creature must
be within short range and able to understand you. The command can’t
inflict direct harm on the creature or its allies, so “Commit suicide”
won’t work, but “Flee” might. In addition, the command can require the
creature to take only one action, so “Unlock the door” might work, but
“Unlock the door and run through it” won’t. A commanded creature can
still defend itself normally and return an attack if one is made on it.
If you possess another ability that allows you to command a creature,
you can target two creatures at once as your base effect if you use
either ability. Action.

Command Beast (3+ Intellect points): You can command a nonhostile,
nonhuman beast (such as one that you’ve made calm with Soothe the
Savage) of up to level 3 within short range. If you are successful, for
the next minute the beast follows your verbal commands to the best of
its understanding and ability. The GM has final say over what counts as
a nonhuman beast, but unless some kind of deception is at work, you
should know whether you can affect a creature before you attempt to use
this ability on it. Aliens, extradimensional entities, very intelligent
creatures, and robots never count.

In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to
use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus, to command
a level 5 beast (two levels above the normal limit), you must apply two
levels of Effort. Action to initiate.

Command Machine (4 Intellect points): If you’ve charmed an unintelligent
machine or have spoken telepathically with an intelligent machine, you
can attempt to command it to take one action within its capabilities on
its next turn. (If you use this ability to command an intelligent
machine, it likely becomes hostile to you afterward.) Action.

Command Metal (5 Intellect points): You reshape a metallic item as you
desire. The item must be within sight and within short range, and its
mass can be no greater than your own. You can affect multiple items at
once as long as their combined mass falls within these limits. You can
fuse multiple items together. You can use this power to destroy a metal
object (as the Destroy Metal ability), or you can craft it into another
desired shape (crudely, unless you have the proper crafting skills). You
can then move the new object anywhere within range. For example, you
could take a few metal shields, fuse them together, and use the
resulting shape to block a doorway. You can use this ability to make an
attack—causing a foe’s armor to constrict, rendering a metal item into
shards that you fling across the battlefield, and so on—against one
target within short range. Regardless of the form of the attack, it is
an Intellect action that deals 7 points of damage. Action.

Command Spirit (3 Intellect points): You can command a spirit or
animated dead creature of up to level 5 within short range. If you are
successful, the target cannot attack you for one minute, during which
time it follows your verbal commands if it can hear and understand you.
Action to initiate.

Communication (2 Intellect points): You can convey a basic concept to a
creature that normally can’t speak or understand speech. The creature
can also give you a very basic answer to a simple question. Action.

Community Activist: When speaking to others in a community you have a
strong connection to, you are trained in persuasion and intimidation
tasks about topics that directly relate to the community. Enabler.

Community Knowledge (2 Intellect points): If you’ve invested yourself in
a community and have spent at least a few months living there, you can
learn things about it through a variety of methods. Sometimes contacts
slip the information to you. Other times, you’re able to draw
conclusions simply by what you can see and hear. When you use this
ability, you can ask the GM one question about the community and get a
very short answer. Action.

Computer Programming: You are trained in using (and exploiting) computer
software, you know one or more computer languages well enough to write
basic programs, and you are fluent in internet protocol. Enabler.

Concussion (7 Intellect points): You cause a pulse of concussive force
to explode out from a point you choose within long range. The pulse
extends up to short range in all directions, dealing 5 points of damage
to everything in the area. Even if you fail the attack roll, targets in
the area take 1 point of damage. Action.

Concussive Blast (2 Intellect points): You release a beam of pure force
that smashes into a creature within short range, inflicting 5 points of
damage and moving it back an immediate distance. Action.

Confidence Artist: When you’re hacking into a computer system, running a
con, picking a pocket, fooling or tricking a dupe, sneaking something by
a guard, and so on, you gain an asset on the task. Enabler.

Confounding Banter (4 Intellect points): You spew a stream of nonsense
to distract a foe within immediate range. On a successful Intellect
roll, your defense roll against the creature’s next attack before the
end of the next round is eased. Action.

Confuse Enemy (4 Intellect points): Through a clever bit of misdirection
involving a flourish of your coat, ducking at just the right moment, or
a similar stratagem, you can attempt to redirect a physical melee attack
that would otherwise hit you. When you do, the misdirected attack hits
another creature you choose within immediate range of both you and the
attacking foe. This ability is a difficulty 2 Intellect task. Enabler.

Conjuration (7 Intellect points): You produce, as if from thin air, a
level 5 creature of a kind you have previously encountered. The creature
remains for one minute and then returns home. While present, the
creature acts as you direct, but this requires no action on your part.
Action.

Connected: You know people who get things done—not just respected people
in positions of authority, but also a variety of online hackers and
regular street criminals. These people are not necessarily your friends
and might not be trustworthy, but they owe you a favor. You and the GM
should work out the details of your contacts. Enabler.

Contortionist (2 Speed points): You can wriggle free from bindings or
squeeze through a tight spot. You are trained in escaping. When you use
an action to escape or move through a tight area, you can immediately
use another action. You may use this action only to move. Enabler.

Control the Field (1 Might point): This melee attack inflicts 1 less
point of damage than normal, and regardless of whether you hit the
target, you maneuver it into a position you desire within immediate
range. Action.

Control Machine (6 Intellect points): You can attempt to control the
functions of any machine, intelligent or otherwise, within short range
for ten minutes. Action.

Control the Savage (6 Intellect points): You can control a calm nonhuman
beast within 30 feet (9 m). You control it for as long as you focus all
your attention on it, using your turn each round. The GM has final say
over what counts as a nonhuman beast, but unless some kind of deception
is at work, you should know whether you can affect a creature before you
attempt to use this ability on it. Aliens, extradimensional entities,
very intelligent creatures, and robots never count. Action.

Control Swarm (2 Intellect points): Your swarm creatures from your
Influence Swarm ability within short range do as you telepathically
command for ten minutes. Even common insects (level 0) in large enough
numbers can swarm about a single creature and hinder its tasks. Action
to initiate.

Control Weather (10 Intellect points): You change the weather in your
general region. If performed indoors, this creates minor effects, such
as mist, mild temperature changes, and so on. If performed outside, you
can create rain, fog, snow, wind, or any other kind of normal (not
overly severe) weather. The change lasts for a natural length of time so
that a storm might last for an hour, fog for two or three hours, and
snow for a few hours (or for ten minutes if it’s out of season). For the
first ten minutes after activating this ability, you can create more
dramatic and specific effects, such as lightning strikes, giant
hailstones, twisters, hurricane-force winds, and so on. These effects
must occur within 1,000 feet (300 m) of your location. You must spend
your turn concentrating to create an effect or maintain it in a new
round. These effects inflict 6 points of damage each round. If you have
this ability from another source, the cost for the ability is 7
Intellect points instead of 10. If you already have the Storm Seed
ability, you can immediately replace it with a new ability of the same
tier. Action to initiate.

Controlled Change: You can try to use your Beast Form ability to change
into your beast form on any night you wish (a difficulty 3 Intellect
task). Any transformations you make using this power are in addition to
the five nights per month that you change involuntarily. Action to
change.

Controlled Fall: When you fall while you are able to use actions and
within reach of a vertical surface, you can attempt to slow your fall.
Make a Speed roll with a difficulty of 1 for every 20 feet (6 m) you
fall. On a success, you take half damage from the fall. If you reduce
the difficulty to 0, you take no damage. Enabler.

Coordinated Effort (3 Intellect points): When you and the duplicate from
your Duplicate ability would attack the same creature, you can choose to
make one attack roll with an asset. If you hit, you inflict damage with
both attacks and treat the attacks as if they were one attack for the
purpose of subtracting Armor from the damage. Action.

Copy Power (2+ Intellect points): You can copy someone else’s superpower
for an hour, performing it as if it were natural for you. Within the
past hour you must have touched the creature whose power you want to
copy (an attack roll) and must have seen that ability used by them.
Choose the power you want to copy, and the GM chooses an appropriate
low-tier ability that most closely resembles that power. For example, if
you’re battling a supervillain who can create blasts of force, if you
copy that ability, you gain a low-tier ability that creates a blast of
force.

In addition to the point cost of Copy Power, you must pay the Might,
Speed, or Intellect cost (if any) of the equivalent ability that the GM
chose. For example, if you want to copy a supervillain’s force blast,
the GM will probably decide that’s equivalent to Onslaught (167), so
you’d pay 2 Intellect points to activate Copy Power and 1 Intellect
point to use Onslaught.

ou can copy only one power at a time; copying another one ends any other
power you’re copying with this ability.

Copy Power doesn’t copy effects of a power that permanently adds points
to your Pools, such as Enhanced Body (134).

In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to
use Effort to copy an ability you saw longer than one hour ago; each
level of Effort used in this way extends the time period by one hour.
Action.

Counter Danger (4 Intellect points): You negate a source of potential
danger related to one creature or object within immediate distance for
one minute (instead of one round, as with Foil Danger). This could be a
weapon or device held by someone, a creature’s natural ability, or a
trap triggered by a pressure plate. You can also try to counter an
action (like moving or making a conventional mundane attack with a
weapon, a claw, etc.). Action. (Using Counter Danger is usually a matter
of the character applying quick thinking in the face of immediate
danger. The ability doesn’t rely on supernatural means, but rather a
practical act.)

Countermeasures (4 Intellect points): You immediately end one ongoing
effect (such as an effect created by a character ability) within
immediate range. Alternatively, you can use this as a defense action to
cancel any incoming ability targeted at you, or you can cancel any
device or the effect of any device for 1d6 rounds. You must touch the
effect or device to cancel it. Action.

Courageous: You are trained in Intellect defense tasks and initiative
tasks. Enabler.

Crafter: You are trained in the crafting of two kinds of items. Enabler.

Create (7 Intellect points): You create something from nothing. You can
create any item you choose that would ordinarily have a difficulty of 5
or lower (using the crafting rules). Once created, the item lasts for a
number of hours equal to 6 minus the difficulty to create it. Thus, if
you create a set of sturdy manacles (difficulty 5), it would last for
one hour. Action.

Create Deadly Poison (3+ Intellect points): You create one dose of a
level 2 poison that either inflicts 5 points of damage or hinders the
poisoned creature’s actions for ten minutes (your choice each time you
create the poison). You can apply this poison to a weapon, food, or
drink as part of the action of creating it. In addition to the normal
options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the
level of the poison; each level of Effort used in this way increases the
poison level by 1. If unused, the poison loses its potency after one
hour. Action.

Create Water (2 Intellect points): You cause water to bubble up from a
spot on the ground you can see. The water flows from that spot for one
minute, creating about 1 gallon (4 liters) by the time it stops. Action
to initiate.

Creature Insight (3 Intellect points): When examining any nonhuman
creature, you can ask the GM one question to gain an idea of its level,
its capabilities, what it eats, what motivates it, what its weaknesses
are (if any), how it can be repaired, or any other similar query. This
is for difficult or strange creatures beyond those readily identified by
using skills. Action.

Critter Companion: A level 1 creature accompanies you and follows your
instructions. This creature is no larger than a large cat (about 20
pounds, or 9 kg) and is normally some sort of domesticated species. You
and the GM must work out the details of your creature, and you’ll
probably make rolls for it in combat or when it takes actions. The
critter companion acts on your turn. As a level 1 creature, it has a
target number of 3 and 3 health, and it inflicts 1 point of damage. Its
movement is based on its creature type (avian, swimmer, and so on). If
your critter companion dies, you can search an urban or wild environment
for 1d6 days to find a new one. Enabler.

Crowd Control (6+ Intellect points): You control the actions of up to
five creatures in short range. This effect lasts for one minute. All
targets must be level 2 or lower. Your control is limited to simple
verbal commands like “Stop,” “Run away,” “Follow that guard,” “Look over
there,” or “Get out of my way.” All affected creatures respond to the
command unless you specifically command them otherwise. In addition to
the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to
increase the maximum level of the targets or affect an additional five
people. Thus, to control a group that has a level 4 target (two levels
above the normal limit) or a group of fifteen people, you must apply two
levels of Effort. When the Crowd Control ability ends, the creatures
remember your commands but don’t remember being controlled—your commands
seemed reasonable at the time. Action to initiate.

Crushing Blow (2 Might points): When you use a bashing or bladed weapon
in both hands and apply Effort on the attack, you get a free level of
Effort on the damage. (If fighting unarmed, this attack is made with
both fists or both feet together.) Action.

Crystal Lens: You can focus the inherent energy surging through you from
your Crystalline Body ability. This allows you to fire a blast of energy
that inflicts 5 points of damage on a target within very long range.
Action.

Crystalline Body: You are composed of animate, translucent crystal the
color of amber. Work with your GM to decide your exact form, though it
is likely about the shape and size of a humanoid. Your crystal body
grants you +2 to Armor and +4 to your Might Pool. However, you’re not
quick and your Speed defense tasks are hindered. Certain conditions,
like mundane diseases and poisons, do not affect you. Your crystalline
body repairs itself more slowly than a body of living flesh would. You
have only the one-round, one-hour, and ten-hour recovery rolls available
each day; you do not have a ten-minute recovery roll available. Any
ability you have that requires a ten-minute recovery roll instead
requires a one-hour recovery roll. Enabler.

Curious: You’re always curious about your surroundings, even on a
subconscious level. Whenever you use Effort to attempt navigation,
perception, or initiative tasks in an area that you’ve only rarely or
never visited before, you can apply an additional free level of Effort.
Enabler.

Cutting Light (2 Intellect points): You emit a thin beam of energized
light from your hand. This inflicts 5 points of damage to a single foe
in immediate range. The beam is even more effective against immobile,
nonliving targets, slicing up to 1 foot (30 cm) of any material that is
level 6 or lower. The material can be up to 1 foot thick. Action.

Cypher Casting: You can cast any of your subtle cyphers on another
creature instead of yourself. You must touch the creature to affect it.
Enabler. 

Cypher Surge: When you use a subtle cypher spell, as part of that action
you can expend one other subtle cypher. Instead of the second cypher’s
normal effect, you add one free level of Effort to the first cypher
spell. Enabler.

Cyphersmith: All manifest cyphers you use function at one level higher
than normal. If given a week and the right tools, chemicals, and parts,
you can tinker with one of your manifest cyphers, transforming it into
another cypher of the same type that you had in the past. The GM and
player should collaborate to ensure that the transformation is
logical—for example, you probably can’t transform a pill into a helmet.
Enabler.

Abilities—D

Damage Dealer: You inflict an additional 3 points of damage with your
chosen weapon. Enabler.

Damage Transference: When you or your duplicate (from the Duplicate
ability) would take damage, you can transfer 1 point of damage from one
to the other provided that you and your duplicate are within 1 mile (1.5
km) of each other. Enabler.

Damn the Guilty (3 Intellect points): You speak words of revelation and
judgment to everyone within close range. Those whom you have designated
as guilty with your Designation ability take an additional 3 points of
damage from any attack they receive from anyone who heard your judgment.
This judgment lasts for up to one minute or until they move at least a
long distance away from you. Action.

Danger Instinct (3 Speed points): If you are attacked by surprise,
whether by a creature, a device, or simply an environmental hazard (a
tree falling on you), you can move an immediate distance before the
attack occurs. If moving prevents the attack, you are safe. If the
attack can still potentially affect you—if the attacking creature can
move to keep pace, if the attack fills an area too big to escape, etc.
—the ability offers no benefit. Enabler.

Danger Sense (1 Speed point): Your initiative task is eased. You pay the
cost each time the ability is used. Enabler.

Dark Explorer: You ignore penalties for any action (including fighting)
in extremely dim light or in cramped spaces. If you also have the Eyes
Adjusted ability, you can act without penalty even in total darkness.
You are trained in sneaking tasks while in dim or no light. Enabler.

Dark Matter Shell (5 Intellect points): For the next minute, you cover
yourself with a shell of dark matter. Your appearance becomes a dark
silhouette, and you gain an asset to sneaking tasks and gain +1 to your
Armor. The dark matter shell works seamlessly with your desires, and if
you apply a level of Effort to any physical task while the shell
persists, you can apply an additional free level of Effort to that same
task. Action to initiate.

Dark Matter Shroud (4 Intellect points): Ribbons of dark matter condense
and swirl about you for up to one minute. This shroud eases your Speed
defense tasks, inflicts 2 points of damage to anyone who tries to touch
you or strike you with a melee attack, and gives you +1 Armor. Action to
initiate.

Dark Matter Strike (4 Intellect points): When you attack a foe within
long range, dark matter condenses around your target and entangles its
limbs, holding it in place and easing your attack by two steps. The
ability works for whatever kind of attack you use (melee, ranged,
energy, and so on). Enabler.

Dark Matter Structure (5 Intellect points): You can form dark matter
into a large structure consisting of up to ten 10-foot (3 m) cubes. The
structure can be somewhat complex, though everything has the same matte
black color from which no light shines. Otherwise, the structure can
possess different densities, textures, and capacities. This means it can
include windows, doors with locks, furnishings, and even decor, as long
as it is all black as pitch. For example, you could shape the dark
matter into a large, defensible structure; a sturdy 100-foot (30 m)
bridge; or anything similar. The structure is a level 6 creation and
lasts for 24 hours. You can’t keep more than one such structure solid at
any one time. Action.

Datajack (1 Intellect point): With computer access, you jack in
instantly and learn a bit more about something you can see. You get an
asset on a task involving that person or object. Action.

Daydream (4 Intellect points): You pull someone into a daydream,
substituting a dream of your own creation for the target’s reality for
up to one minute. You can affect a target within long range that you can
see, or a target within 10 miles (16 km) that you have hair or skin
clippings from. To all outward appearances, an affected target stands
(or lies) unmoving. But inside, the substituted reality (or dream within
a dream, if the target was sleeping) is what the target experiences. If
the target is under duress, it can attempt another Intellect defense
roll each round to break free, though the target may not realize its
state. Either the dream unfolds according to a script you prepared when
you used this ability, or if you use your own actions (forcing you into
a similar state as the target), you can direct the unfolding dream from
round to round. Using this ability on a sleeping target eases the
initial attack. Action to initiate; if you direct the dream, action to
direct per round.

Dazing Attack (3 Might points): You hit your foe in just the right spot,
dazing them so that tasks they attempt on their next turn are hindered.
This attack inflicts normal damage. Action.

Dazzling Sunburst (2 Intellect points): You send a barrage of dazzling
colors at a creature within short range and, if successful, inflict 2
points of damage on the target. In addition, the creature’s attacks are
hindered on its next turn, unless the target relies primarily on senses
other than sight. Action.

Deactivate Mechanisms (5+ Speed points): You make a melee attack that
inflicts no damage against a machine. Instead, if the attack hits, make
a second Speed-based roll. If successful, a machine of level 3 or lower
is deactivated for one minute. For each additional level of Effort
applied, you can affect one higher level of machine or you can extend
the duration for an additional minute. If you have the Scramble Machine
or Disable Mechanisms ability (or an ability that works similarly), when
you apply a level of Effort to any of them, you gain an additional free
level of Effort. Action.

Deadly Aim (3 Speed points): For the next minute, all ranged attacks you
make inflict 2 additional points of damage. Action to initiate.

Deadly Strike (5 Might points): If you strike a foe of level 3 or lower
with a weapon you’re practiced with, you kill the target instantly.
Action.

Deadly Swarm (6 Intellect points): If you’re in a location where it’s
possible for your swarm of creatures from your Influence Swarm ability
to come, you call a swarm of them for ten minutes. During this time,
they do as you telepathically command as long as they are within long
range. They can swarm about and hinder any or all opponents’ tasks, or
they can focus the swarm and attack all opponents within immediate range
of each other (all within long range of you). The attacking swarm
inflicts 4 points of damage. While the creatures are in long range, you
can speak to them telepathically and perceive through their senses.
Action to initiate. (Swarms don’t usually have game stats, but if
needed, a typical swarm is level 2. Only attacks that affect a large
area affect the swarm.)

Death Touch (6 Intellect points): You gather disrupting energy in your
fingertip and touch a creature. If the target is an NPC or a creature of
level 3 or lower, it dies. If the target is a PC of any tier, they move
down one step on the damage track. Action.

Debate (3 Intellect points): In any gathering of two or more people
trying to establish the truth or come to a decision, you can sway the
verdict with masterful rhetoric. If you are given one minute or more to
argue your point, either the decision goes your way or, if someone else
effectively argues a competing point, any associated persuasion or
deception task is eased by two steps. Action to initiate; one minute to
complete.

Debilitating Strike (4 Speed points): You make an attack to deliver a
painful or debilitating strike. The attack is hindered. If it hits, the
creature takes 2 additional points of damage at the end of the next
round, and its attacks are hindered until the end of the next round.
Action.

Decipher (1 Intellect point): If you spend one minute examining a piece
of writing or code in a language you do not understand, you can make an
Intellect roll of difficulty 3 (or higher, based on the complexity of
the language or code) to get the gist of the message. Action to
initiate.

Deep Consideration (6 Intellect points): When you develop a plan that
involves you and your friends working together to accomplish a goal, you
can ask the GM one very general question about what is likely to happen
if you carry out the plan, and you will get a simple, brief answer. In
addition, all of you gain an asset to one roll related to enacting the
plan you developed together, as long as you put the plan into action
within a few days of the plan’s creation. Action.

Deep Reserves: When others are exhausted, you can push through. Once
each day, you can transfer up to 5 points among your Pools in any
combination, at a rate of 1 point per round. For example, you could
transfer 3 points of Might to Speed and 2 points of Intellect to Speed,
which would take a total of five rounds. Action.

Deep Resources: You gain an additional 6 points to your Speed Pool.
Enabler.

Deep Water Guide: While underwater, any creature you choose that can see
you has an asset on swimming tasks. Enabler.

Defend All the Innocent: You protect everyone within immediate range
whom you have designated as innocent with your Designation ability.
Speed defense rolls made by such creatures gain an asset. Enabler.

Defend the Innocent (2 Speed points): For the next ten minutes, if
someone you have designated as innocent with the Designation ability
stands next to you, that creature shares any defensive advantages that
you might have, other than mundane armor. These advantages include the
Speed defense from your shield, the Armor offered from a force field,
and so on. In addition, Speed defense rolls made by the innocent
creature gain an asset. You can protect only one innocent creature at a
time. Action to initiate.

Defending Weapon: When using your enchanted weapon, you are trained in
Speed defense tasks. Enabler. 

Defense Against Robots: You have studied your enemy and are trained in
anticipating the actions that a robot or machine is likely to take in a
fight. Defense tasks you attempt against these foes are eased. Enabler.

Defense Master: Every time you succeed at a Speed defense task, you can
make an immediate attack against your foe. (If you have Dodge and
Respond, you can exchange that ability for Dodge and Resist.) Your
attack must be the same type (melee weapon, ranged weapon, or unarmed)
as the attack you defend against. If you don’t have an appropriate type
of weapon ready, you can’t use this ability. Enabler.

Defensive Augmentation: By upgrading your nervous and immune systems,
you are trained in Might defense and Speed defense tasks. Enabler.

Defensive Blinking (4 Intellect points): You enter a heightened reactive
state so that when you are struck hard enough to take damage, you
teleport an immediate distance in a random direction (not up or down) to
help evade the brunt of the attack. Your Speed defense rolls are eased
for one minute. Action.

Defensive Field: Thanks to subdermal implants, a permanent spell, alien
modifications, or something similar, you now have a force field that
radiates 1 inch (2.5 cm) from your body and provides you with +2 Armor.
Enabler.

Defensive Phasing (2 Intellect points): You can change your phase so
that some attacks pass through you harmlessly. For the next ten minutes,
you gain an asset to your Speed defense tasks, but during this time you
lose any benefit from armor you wear. Action to initiate.

Define Down (4 Intellect points): The natural gravity within an area a
short distance across that you are within immediate range of changes
directions so that it flows in the direction you determine (up, up and
to the south, west, and so on) for a few seconds, then snaps back.
Affected targets could be tossed up to 20 feet (6 m) and take a few
points of damage. Action.

Deflect Attacks (1 Intellect point): Using your mind, you protect
yourself from incoming attacks. For the next ten minutes, you are
trained in Speed defense tasks. Action to initiate.

Defuse Situation: During the course of an investigation, your questions
sometimes elicit an angry or even violent response. Through dissembling,
verbal distraction, or similar evasion, you prevent a living foe from
attacking anyone or anything for one round. Action.

Demeanor of Command (2 Intellect points): You project confidence,
knowledge, and charisma to all who see you for the next hour. Your
demeanor is such that those who see you automatically understand that
you are someone important, accomplished, and with authority. When you
speak, strangers who are not already attacking give you at least a round
to have your say. If speaking to a group that can understand you, you
can attempt to have them produce their leader or ask that they take you
to their leader. You gain a free level of Effort that can be applied to
one persuasion task you attempt during this period. Action to initiate.

Designation: You assign an innocent or guilty label to one creature
within immediate range, based on your assessment of a given situation or
a predominant feeling. In other words, someone who is labeled innocent
can be innocent in a certain circumstance, or they can be generally
innocent of terrible crimes (such as murder, major theft, and so on).
Likewise, you can declare that a creature is guilty of a particular
crime or of terrible deeds in general. The accuracy of your assessment
isn’t important as long as you believe it to be the truth; the GM may
require you to give a rationale. Henceforth, your tasks to socially
interact with someone you designate as innocent gain an asset, and your
attacks against those you designate as guilty gain an asset. You can
change your assessment, but it requires another designation action. The
benefits of the designation last until you change it or until you are
shown proof that it is wrong. Action. (The benefits provided by
Designation apply to the character using the ability, their allies, and
anyone who hears or is told of their judgment and believes their
assessment.)

Destined for Greatness: You enjoy uncanny luck as if something was
watching over you and keeping you from harm. When you would otherwise
descend a step on the damage track, make an Intellect defense roll
versus the difficulty set by the level of the foe or effect. If you
succeed, you do not descend that step. If the step was because you fell
to 0 points in a Pool, you are still at 0 points; you just don’t suffer
the negative effects of being impaired or debilitated. If you would
otherwise descend the final step on the damage track to death, a
successful defense roll keeps you at 1 point in one Pool, and you remain
debilitated. Enabler.

Destroy Metal (3 Intellect points): You instantly tear, rip, or burst a
metal object that is within sight, within short range, and no bigger
than half your size. Attempt an Intellect task to destroy the object;
the task is eased by three steps compared to breaking it with brute
strength. Action.

Destroyer (6 Might points): If you succeed on a Might task to damage an
object, instead of descending one step on the object damage track, the
object descends all three steps and is destroyed. Action.

Detect Life (3+ Might points): You consciously send out a pulse of your
your life energy. You detect all living creatures within short range,
even if they are behind cover, though not if they’re behind a force
field. When you detect a creature, you detect its general location (to
within an immediate range). If you apply two additional levels of
Effort, you can increase the range of detection to long. Action.

Device Insight (3 Intellect points): When examining any unknown, alien,
or high-technology device, you can ask the GM one question to gain an
idea of its capabilities, how it functions, how it can be activated or
deactivated, what its weaknesses are (if any), how it can be repaired,
or any other similar query. This is for difficult or strange things
beyond those readily identified by using the appropriate knowledge or
technical skill. Action.

Devoted Defender (2 Might or Intellect points): Choose one character you
can see. That character becomes your ward. You are trained in all tasks
involving finding, healing, interacting with, and protecting that
character. You can have only one ward at a time. Action to initiate.

Diamagnetism: You magnetize any nonmetallic object within short range so
that it can be affected by your other magnetic powers. Thus, with Move
Metal, you can move any object. With Repel Metal, you are trained in all
Speed defense tasks, regardless of whether the incoming attack uses
metal. And so on. Enabler.

Dimensional Squeeze (2+ Intellect points): You cram yourself into a
transitional dimension, allowing you to instantaneously appear anywhere
you choose within short range if you have a clear and unobstructed path
to that location. You can pass through an intervening barrier if it has
an open space that you could easily fit your head through—about 1 square
foot (30 cm by 30 cm square). In addition to the normal options for
using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to pass through a smaller
opening in a barrier; each level of Effort used in this way reduces the
minimum opening size by one-fourth. You land safely when you use this
ability. Action.

Transitional dimension: A dimension where distances are shorter compared
to those in other dimensions, so travel through it is faster than normal
movement.

Dirty Fighter (2 Speed points): You distract, blind, annoy, hamper, or
otherwise interfere with a foe, hindering their attacks and defenses for
one minute. Action.

Disable Mechanisms (3 Speed points): With a keen eye and quick moves,
you disrupt some functions of a robot or machine and inflict upon it one
of the following maladies:

All its tasks are hindered for one minute.

Its speed is halved.

It can take no action for one round.

It deals 2 fewer points of damage (minimum 1 point) for one minute.

You must touch the robot or machine to disrupt it (if you are making an
attack, it inflicts no damage). Action.

Disappear (4 Intellect points): You bend light that falls on you so you
seem to disappear. You are invisible to other creatures for ten minutes.
While invisible, you are specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks.
This effect ends if you do something to reveal your presence or
position—attacking, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on.
If this occurs, you can regain the remaining invisibility effect by
taking an action to focus on hiding your position. Action to initiate or
reinitiate.

Disarming Attack (5 Speed points): You attempt a Speed task to disarm a
foe as part of your melee attack. If you succeed, your attack inflicts 3
additional points of damage and the target’s weapon is knocked from
their grip, landing up to 20 feet (6 m) away. If you fail, you still
attempt your normal attack, but you don’t inflict the extra damage or
disarm the opponent if you hit. Action.

Disarming Strike (3 Speed points): Your attack inflicts 1 point less
damage and disarms your foe so that their weapon is now 10 feet (3 m)
away on the ground. (If your chosen weapon is a whip, you can instead
deposit the disarmed weapon into your hands; if your chosen weapon is a
bow or other ranged weapon that fires physical rounds, you can instead
“nail” the disarmed weapon to a nearby object or structure. Choosing to
do either of these hinders your attack.) Action.

Discerning Mind: You have +3 Armor against damaging attacks and damaging
effects that target your mind and Intellect. Defense rolls you make
against attacks that attempt to confuse, persuade, frighten, or
otherwise influence you are eased. Enabler.

Discipline of Watchfulness (7 Intellect points): You keep your allies on
their toes with occasional questions, jokes, and even mock drills for
those who care to join in. After spending 24 hours with you, your allies
can apply a free level of Effort to any initiative tasks they attempt.
This benefit is ongoing while you remain in the allies’ company. It ends
if you leave, but it resumes if you return to the allies’ company within
24 hours. If you leave the allies’ company for more than 24 hours, you
must spend another 24 hours together to reactivate the benefit. You must
spend the Intellect point cost each 24 hours you wish to keep the
benefit active. Enabler.

Disguise: You are trained in disguise. You can alter your posture,
voice, mannerisms, and hair to look like someone else for as long as you
keep up the disguise. However, it is extremely difficult to adopt the
appearance of a specific individual without a disguise kit at your
disposal. Enabler.

Disguise Other (4+ Intellect points): You apply your shapechanging
ability to another creature of your size or smaller, giving them a form
that you are able to assume. This lasts for about ten minutes.

In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to
use Effort to increase the duration; one level of Effort increases it to
an hour, two increases it to a day. A creature can revert to its normal
form as an action, but it cannot then change back into the altered form.
Action.

You probably can’t use Disguise Other to disguise a kind of creature
that is very different from you, such as a human disguising a robot,
animal, or crystalline alien

Disincentivize (1 Intellect point): You hinder all actions attempted by
any number of targets within short range who can understand you. You
choose which targets are affected. Affected targets’ actions are
hindered for one round. Enabler.

Disrupting Touch (1+ Might points): You can turn your Phase Sprint into
a melee attack by purposefully grazing another creature as you run. When
you do, the touch releases a violent blast of energy that inflicts 2
points of damage to the target (ignores Armor). Whether you hit or miss,
your movement (and turn) ends immediately, which puts you within
immediate distance of your target. If you apply Effort to increase
damage rather than to ease the task, you deal 2 additional points of
damage per level of Effort (instead of 3 points); the target takes 1
point of damage even if you fail the attack roll. Enabler.

Distance Viewing (5 Intellect points): You know that space and distance
are illusions. You concentrate to create an invisible, immobile sensor
at a location you have previously visited or viewed (at the GM’s
discretion, you may have to succeed at an Intellect task if the location
is warded). The sensor lasts for one hour. Once it is created, you can
concentrate to see, hear, and smell through the sensor. It doesn’t grant
you sensory capabilities beyond the norm. Action to create; action to
check.

Distant Interface (2 Intellect points): You can activate, deactivate, or
control a machine at long range as if you were next to it, even if
normally you would have to touch or manually operate it. If you have
never interacted with the particular machine before, the task is
hindered by two steps. To use this ability, you must understand the
function of the machine, it must be your size or smaller, and it can’t
be connected to another intelligence (or be intelligent itself). Action.

Distortion (2 Intellect points): You modify how a willing creature
within short range reflects light for one minute. The target rapidly
shifts between its normal appearance and a blot of darkness. The target
has an asset on Speed defense rolls until the effect wears off. Action
to initiate.

Diver: You can safely dive into water from heights of up to 100 feet (30
m), and you can withstand pressure when in water as deep as  
100 feet. Enabler.

Divert Attacks (4 Speed points): For one minute, you automatically
deflect or dodge any ranged projectile attacks. However, on your next
turn after you’re attacked with ranged projectiles, all your other
actions are hindered. Action to initiate.

Divide Your Mind (7 Intellect points): You split your consciousness into
two parts. For one minute, you can take two actions on each of your
turns, but only one of them can be to use a special ability. Action.

Divine Intervention (2 Intellect points, or 2 Intellect points + 4 XP):
You ask the divine to intervene on your behalf, usually against a
creature within long range, changing the course of its life in a small
way by introducing a major special effect upon it. The major special
effect is akin to what occurs when you roll a natural 20 on an attack.
If you want to try for a larger effect, and if the GM allows it, you can
attempt a divine intervention with a more far-reaching effect, which is
more like the kind of GM intrusion initiated by the GM on their players.
In this case, Divine Intervention also costs 4 XP, the effect may not
work out exactly like you hope, and you may not make another plea for
divine intervention for a week. Action.

Divine Knowledge: You are trained in all tasks related to knowledge of
godly beings. Enabler.

Divine Radiance (2 Intellect points): Your prayer calls divine radiance
from the heavens to punish an unworthy target within long range,
inflicting 4 points of damage. If the target is a demon, spirit, or
something similar, it also stands in unwilling awe of the divine energy
coursing through it and is unable to act on its next turn. Once exposed
to this blessing, the target can’t be awed by this attack again for
several hours. Action.

Divine Symbol (5+ Intellect points): You invoke divine power by scribing
a glowing symbol in the air with your fingers. Writhing pillars of
divine radiance spear up to five targets within long range. A successful
attack on a target inflicts 5 points of damage. If you apply Effort to
increase the damage, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level of
Effort (instead of 3 points); targets take 1 point of damage even if you
fail the attack roll. Action.

Do You Know Who I Am? (3 Intellect points): Acting only as someone who
is famous and used to privilege can, you verbally harangue a living foe
who can hear and understand you so forcefully that it is unable to take
any action, including making attacks, for one round. Whether you succeed
or fail, the next action the target takes after your attempt is
hindered. Action.

Dodge and Resist (3 Speed points): You can reroll any of your Might,
Speed, or Intellect defense rolls and take the better of the two
results. Enabler.

Dodge and Respond (3 Might points): If a melee attack misses you, you
can immediately make a melee attack in return, but no more than once per
turn. Enabler.

Double Strike (3 Might points): When you wield two weapons, you can
choose to make one attack roll against a foe. If you hit, you inflict
damage with both weapons plus 2 additional points of damage, and because
you made a single attack, the target’s Armor is subtracted only once.
Action.

Dragon’s Maw (6 Intellect points): You fashion and control a “hovering”
phantasmal construct of magic within long range that resembles a
dragon’s head. The construct lasts for up to an hour, until it is
destroyed, or until you cast another spell. It is a level 4 construct
that inflicts 6 points of damage with its bite when directed. While the
construct persists, you can use it to manipulate large objects, carry
heavy items in its mouth, or attack foes. If you use it to attack foes,
you must use your action to directly control the phantom maw for each
attack. Action to initiate.

Drain at a Distance: Your Drain Machine and Drain Creature abilities
work on a target within short range. Enabler.

Drain Charge: You can drain the power from an artifact or device,
allowing you to regain 1 Intellect point per level drained. You regain
points at the rate of 1 point per round and must give your full
concentration to the process each round. The GM determines whether the
device is fully drained (likely true of most handheld or smaller
devices) or retains some power (likely true of large machines). Action
to initiate; action each round to drain.

Drain Creature (3+ Intellect points): You can drain energy from a living
creature you touch, inflicting 3 points of damage and restoring 3 points
to your Might or Speed Pool. Action.

Drain Machine (3+ Intellect points): You can drain the power from an
artifact or powered device you touch. If the target is a robot, you
inflict 3 points of damage and restore 3 points to your Might or Speed
Pool. If the target is an object, you restore points to your Might or
Speed Pool equal to the level of the target. If the target is a manifest
cypher, it is fully drained and useless. Artifacts and similar devices
must immediately check for depletion (items with a depletion of “—” are
either immune to this ability or have a depletion of 1 in 1d10 when
attacked with this ability). Action.

Drain Power (5 Speed points): You affect the main power source of a
robot or machine, inflicting upon it all four conditions in Disable
Mechanisms at once. You must touch the robot to do this (if you are
making an attack, it inflicts no damage). Action.

Draw Conclusion (3 Intellect points): After careful observation and
investigation (questioning one or more NPCs on a topic, searching an
area or a file, and so on) lasting a few minutes, you can learn a
pertinent fact. This ability is a difficulty 3 Intellect task. Each
additional time you use this ability, the task is hindered by an
additional step. The difficulty returns to 3 after you rest for ten
hours. Action.

Drawing on Life’s Experiences (6 Intellect points): You’ve seen a lot
and done a lot, and that experience comes in handy. Ask the GM one
question, and you’ll receive a general answer. The GM assigns a level to
the question, so the more obscure the answer, the more difficult the
task. Generally, knowledge that you could find by looking somewhere
other than your current location is level 1, and obscure knowledge of
the past is level 7. Action.

Dreadwood (6 Intellect points): You manipulate wind, mist, and shadows
to embody the primordial fear of mysterious woods. For the next minute,
you gain an asset on intimidation tasks. Creatures within short range
may become frightened; make a separate Intellect attack roll for each
creature (if you are larger than normal from using Great Tree or another
source, these rolls are eased). Success means that they are frozen in
fear, not moving or taking actions for one minute or until they are
attacked. Some creatures without minds might be immune to this fear.
Action. 

Dream Becomes Reality (4 Intellect points): You create a dream object of
any shape you can imagine that is your size or smaller, which takes on
apparent substance and heft. The object is crude and can have no moving
parts, so you can make a sword, a shield, a short ladder, and so on. The
dream object has the approximate mass of the real object, if you choose.
Your dream objects are as strong as iron, but if you do not remain
within long range of them, they function for only one minute before
fading away. Action.

Dream Thief (2 Intellect points): You steal a previous dream from a
living creature within short range. The creature loses 2 points of
Intellect (ignores Armor), and you learn something the GM chooses to
reveal about the creature—its nature, a portion of its plans, a memory,
and so on. Action.

Dreamcraft (1 Intellect point): You pull an image from a dream into the
waking world and place it somewhere within long range. The dream lasts
for up to one minute, and it can be tiny or fill an area an immediate
distance in diameter. Though it appears solid, the dream is intangible.
The dream (a scene, a creature, or an object) is static unless you use
your action each round to animate it. As part of that animation, you
could move the dream up to a short distance each round, as long as it
remains within long range. If you animate the dream, it can make sound
but does not produce odor. Direct physical interaction or sustained
interaction with the dream shatters it into dispersing mist. For
example, attacking the dream shatters it, as does the strain of keeping
up appearances when an NPC moves through a dream scene or engages a
dream creature in conversation for more than a couple of rounds. Action
to initiate; action to animate.

Driver: You are trained in all tasks related to driving a car, truck, or
motorcycle, including mechanical repair tasks. Enabler.

Driving on the Edge: You can make an attack with a light or medium
ranged weapon and attempt a driving task as a single action. Enabler.

Dual Defense: When you wield two weapons, you are trained in Speed
defense tasks. Enabler.

Dual Distraction (1+ Speed points): When you wield two weapons, your
opponent’s next attack is hindered, and if you apply Effort on your next
attack against that same foe, you get a free level of Effort on the
task. Enabler.

Dual Light Wield: You can use two light weapons at the same time, making
two separate attacks on your turn as a single action. You remain limited
by the amount of Effort you can apply on one action, but because you
make separate attacks, your opponent’s Armor applies to both. Anything
that modifies your attack or damage applies to both attacks, unless it’s
specifically tied to one of the weapons. Enabler.

Dual Medium Wield: You can use two light weapons or medium weapons at
the same time (or one light weapon and one medium weapon), making two
separate attacks on your turn as a single action. This ability otherwise
works like the Dual Light Wield ability. Enabler.

Dual Wards: You can have two wards from Devoted Defender at a time.
Choosing a second ward can be its own action, or you can choose two
wards with one action (and only pay the cost once for doing so). The
wards must remain within an immediate distance of each other. Benefits
provided by Devoted Defender apply to both your wards. If your wards
separate, you choose which retains the benefit. If they come back
together, both regain the benefit immediately. Enabler.

Duel to the Death (5 Speed points): Choose a target (a single individual
creature that you can see). You are trained in all tasks involving
fighting that creature. When you successfully attack that target, you
inflict +5 damage, or +7 damage if the creature is engaging someone else
instead of you. You can duel only one creature at a time. A duel lasts
up to one minute, or until you break it off. Action to initiate.

Duplicate (2 Might points): You cause a duplicate of yourself to appear
at any point you can see within short range. The duplicate has no
clothing or possessions when it appears. The duplicate is a level 2 NPC
with 6 health. The duplicate obeys your commands and does as you direct
it. The duplicate remains until you dismiss it using an action or until
it is killed. When the duplicate disappears, it leaves behind anything
it was wearing or carrying. If the duplicate disappears because it was
killed, you take 4 points of damage that ignore Armor, and you lose your
next action. Action to initiate.

Dust to Dust (7 Intellect points): You disintegrate one object that is
smaller than you and whose level is less than or equal to your tier. You
must touch the object to affect it. If the GM feels it appropriate to
the circumstances, you can disintegrate a portion of an object (the
total volume of which is smaller than you) rather than the entire thing.
Action.

Abilities—E

Earthquake (7 Might points): You direct your destructive resonance into
the ground and trigger an earthquake centered on a spot you can see
within very long range. The ground within short range of that spot
heaves and shakes for five minutes, causing damage to structures and
terrain in the area. Buildings and terrain features shed debris and
rubble. Each round, creatures in the area take either 3 points of damage
due to the general shaking, or 6 points of damage if in or adjacent to a
structure or terrain feature shedding debris. Action to initiate.

Echolocation: You are especially sensitive to sound and vibration, so
much so that you can sense your environment within a short distance
regardless of your ability to see. Enabler.

Effective Skill: Choose one noncombat skill when you gain this ability.
You get a minor effect with that skill when you roll a natural 14 or
higher (the d20 shows “14” or more). You get a major effect with that
skill when you roll a natural 19 or higher (the d20 shows “19” or
higher). You can select this ability more than once. Each time you
select it, you must choose a different noncombat skill. Enabler.

Elastic Grip (3 Might points): Your attack with your stretchy limbs or
body is eased. If you hit, you can grab the target, preventing it from
moving on its next turn. While you hold the target, its attacks or
attempts to break free are hindered. If the target attempts to break
free instead of attacking, you must succeed at a Might-based task to
maintain your grip. If the target fails to break free, you can continue
to hold it each round as your subsequent actions, automatically
inflicting 4 points of damage each round by squeezing. Enabler.

Electric Armor (4 Intellect points): When you wish it, electricity
crackles across your body for ten minutes, granting you +1 Armor. While
electrified, you have an additional +2 Armor versus electrical damage
specifically, and you inflict 2 points of damage on any creature that
touches you or attacks you with a melee weapon that conducts
electricity. Enabler.

Electrical Flight (5 Intellect points): You exude an aura of crackling
electricity that lets you fly a long distance each round for ten
minutes. You can’t carry other creatures with you. Action to activate.

Elemental Protection (4+ Intellect points): You and every target you
designate within immediate range gains +5 Armor against one type of
direct elemental damage (such as fire, lightning, shadow, or thorn) for
one hour, or until you cast this spell again. Each level of Effort
applied increases the elemental protection by +2. Action to initiate.

Elusive (2 Speed points): When you succeed on a Speed defense action,
you immediately gain an action. You can use this action only to move.
Enabler.

Embrace the Night (7+ Intellect points): You fashion a truly horrifying
facade of a creature from swirling ribbons of dark matter and launch it
at your foes within long range. Each round, you can attack a target
within long range using the creation as your weapon. When you attack,
the creature inserts hair-fine tendrils of shadow into the target’s eyes
and brain. The target takes 3 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor)
and is stunned for one round so that it loses its next turn.
Alternatively, you can cause the creature to take other actions, as long
as you are able to see it and mentally control it as your action. The
creature disperses after about a minute. Action to initiate.

Embraced by Darkness (6 Intellect points): For the next hour, you take
on some characteristics of a shadow thanks to a fundamental adaptation
of your flesh or a device you’ve kept secret. Your appearance is a dark
silhouette. When you apply a level of Effort to sneaking tasks, you get
a free level of Effort on the task. During this time, you can move
through the air at a rate of a short distance per round, and you can
move through solid barriers (even those that are sealed to prevent the
passage of light or shadow), but not energy barriers, at a rate of 1
foot (30 cm) per round. You can perceive while passing through a barrier
or object, which allows you to peek through walls. As a shadow, you
can’t affect or be affected by normal matter. Likewise, you can’t
attack, touch, or otherwise affect anything. However, attacks and
effects that rely on light can affect you, and sudden bursts of light
can potentially make you lose your next turn. Action to initiate.

Enable Others: You can use the helping rules to provide a benefit to
another character attempting a physical task. Unlike the normal helping
rules, this doesn’t require you to use your action helping the other
character with the task. This requires no action on your part. Enabler.

Enchanted Movement (4+ Intellect points): You use your enchanted weapon
to move yourself to any location within a long distance that you can
see, as long as there are no obstacles or barriers in your way. The
exact way this happens depends on your weapon; you might throw your
magical hammer and be pulled along after it, shoot an arrow from your
bow that pulls you forward like a grapple line, and so on. In addition
to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to
increase the distance traveled; each level of Effort used in this way
increases the range by another 100 feet (30 m). If you have another
ability (such as from your type) that allows you to cross a long
distance, the range of that ability and this one increases to very long.
Action. 

Enchanted Weapon (1 Intellect point): You attune yourself to a physical
weapon, such as a sword, hammer, or bow. You know exactly where it is if
it is within a short distance of you, and you know its general direction
and distance if farther away. All of your other focus abilities require
you to be holding or wielding this weapon. You can be attuned to only
one weapon at a time; attuning yourself to a second weapon loses the
attunement to the first one. Action to initiate, ten minutes to
complete. Enabler. 

If you attune yourself to a different weapon, come up with a story
reason for why you are able to do that and why you chose this new
weapon.

Encouragement (1 Intellect point): While you maintain this ability
through ongoing inspiring oration, your allies within short range ease
one of the following task types (your choice): defense tasks, attack
tasks, or tasks related to any skill that you are trained or specialized
in. Action.

Encouraging Presence (2 Intellect points): For one minute, allies within
short range gain an asset on defense rolls. Action.

Endurance: Any duration dealing with physical actions is either doubled
or halved, whichever is better for you. For example, if the typical
person can hold their breath for thirty seconds, you can  
hold it for one minute. If the typical person can march for four hours
without stopping, you can do so for eight hours. In terms of harmful
effects, if a poison paralyzes its victims for one minute, you are
paralyzed for thirty seconds. The minimum duration is always one round.
Enabler.

Energize Creature (6+ Might points): You extend your Absorb Kinetic
Energy ability to one creature within immediate range so that they also
can absorb energy from physical attacks and impacts for one hour. That
creature, however, cannot release excess energy as a blast. For each
level of Effort you apply, you can increase the number of targets you
affect by one. If you have Absorb Pure Energy or Improved Absorb Kinetic
Energy, those abilities are also duplicated in your target when you use
Energize Creature. Action to initiate.

Energize Crowd (9 Might points): You extend your Absorb Kinetic Energy
ability to up to thirty creatures within short range so that they also
can absorb energy from physical attacks and impacts for one hour. If you
have Absorb Pure Energy or Improved Absorb Kinetic Energy, these
creatures can use those abilities as well. The creatures, however,
cannot release excess energy as a blast. Action to initiate.

Energize Object: By focusing your Absorb Kinetic Energy ability on an
object (like a weapon), you infuse it with your power. The object holds
the energy until it is touched by anyone but you, so putting it into
your melee weapon or the ammo of a ranged weapon allows the weapon to
trigger the energy in combat. The energy inflicts 3 points of damage on
the creature touched in addition to any damage the weapon itself might
do. You cannot have more than one energized object on your person at a
time. Action to initiate.

Energized Shield: Your force shield from your Force Field Shield ability
now pulses with dangerous energy whenever you manifest it. Each time you
use your shield as a melee or ranged weapon, it inflicts an additional 3
points of damage. Enabler.

Energy Protection (3+ Intellect points): Choose a discrete type of
energy that you have experience with (such as heat, sonic, electricity,
and so on). You gain +10 to Armor against damage from that type of
energy for ten minutes. Alternatively, you gain +1 to Armor against
damage from that energy for 24 hours. You must be familiar with the type
of energy; for example, if you have no experience with a certain kind of
extradimensional energy, you can’t protect against it. In addition to
the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to
protect more targets; each level of Effort used in this way affects up
to two additional targets. You must touch additional targets to protect
them. Action to initiate.

Energy Resistance: Choose a discrete type of energy that you have
experience with (such as heat, sonic, electricity, and so on). You gain
+5 to Armor against damage from that type of energy. You must be
familiar with the type of energy; for example, if you have no experience
with a certain kind of extradimensional energy, you can’t protect
against it. You can select this ability more than once. Each time you
select it, you must choose a different kind of energy. Enabler.

Enhance Strength (3 Intellect points): For the next ten minutes, you
gain an asset on tasks that depend on brute force, such as moving a
heavy object, smashing down a door, or hitting someone with a melee
weapon. Action to initiate.

Enhanced Beast Form: When you use Beast Form, your beast form gains the
following additional bonuses: +3 to your Might Pool, +2 to your Speed
Pool, and +2 to Armor. Enabler.

Enhanced Body: Your machine parts grant you +1 to Armor, +3 to your
Might Pool, and +3 to your Speed Pool. Traditional healing skills,
medicines, and techniques work only half as well for you. Each time you
start at full health, the first 5 points of damage you take can never be
healed in these ways or recovered normally. Instead, you must use
repairing skills and abilities to restore those points. For example, if
you start with a full Might Pool of 10 and take 8 points of damage, you
can use recovery rolls to restore 3 points, but the remaining 5 points
must be restored with repair tasks. Enabler.

Enhanced Intellect: You gain 3 points to your Intellect Pool. Enabler.

Enhanced Intellect Edge: You gain +1 to your Intellect Edge. Enabler.

Enhanced Might: You gain 3 points to your Might Pool. Enabler.

Enhanced Might Edge: You gain +1 to your Might Edge. Enabler.

Enhanced Phased Attack (5 Intellect points): This ability works like the
Phased Attack ability except that your attack also disrupts the foe’s
vitals, dealing an additional 5 points of damage. Enabler.

Enhanced Physique: You gain 3 points to divide among your Might and
Speed Pools however you wish. Enabler.

Enhanced Potential: You gain 3 points to divide among your stat Pools
however you wish. Enabler.

Enhanced Speed: You gain 3 points to your Speed Pool. Enabler.

Enhanced Speed Edge: You gain +1 to your Speed Edge. Enabler.

Enlarge (1+ Might point): You trigger an enzymatic reaction that draws
additional mass from another dimension, and you (and your clothing or
suit) grow larger. You achieve a height of 9 feet (3 m) and stay that
way for about a minute. During that time, you add 4 points to your Might
Pool, add +1 to Armor, and add +2 to your Might Edge. While you are
larger than normal, your Speed defense rolls are hindered, and you are
practiced in using your fists as heavy weapons.

When the effects of Enlarge end, your Armor and Might Edge return to
normal, and you subtract a number of points from your Might Pool equal
to the number you gained (if this brings the Pool to 0, subtract the
overflow first from your Speed Pool and then, if necessary, from your
Intellect Pool). Each additional time you use Enlarge before your next
ten-hour recovery roll, you must apply an additional level of Effort.
Thus, the second time you use Enlarge, you must apply one level of
Effort; the third time you use Enlarge, two levels of Effort; and so on.

Action to initiate.

Enlightened: You are trained in any perception task that involves sight.
Enabler.

Entangling Force (1+ Intellect point): A target within short range is
subject to a snare constructed of semi-tangible lines of force for one
minute. The force snare is a level 2 construct. A target caught in the
force snare cannot move from its position, but it can attack and defend
normally. The target can also use its action attempting to break free.
You can increase the level of the force snare by 1 per level of Effort
applied. Action to initiate.

Enthrall (1 Intellect point): While talking, you grab and keep another
creature’s attention, even if the creature can’t understand you. For as
long as you do nothing but speak (you can’t even move), the other
creature takes no actions other than to defend itself, even over
multiple rounds. If the creature is attacked, the effect ends. Action.

Entourage: You gain an entourage of five level 1 twenty-somethings that
accompanies you wherever you go unless you purposefully disband it for a
particular outing. You can ask them to deliver things for you, run
messages, pick up your dry cleaning—pretty much whatever you want,
within reason. They can also run interference if you’re trying to avoid
someone, help hide you from media attention, help you muscle through a
crowd, and so on. On the other hand, if a situation becomes physically
violent, they retreat to safety. Enabler.

Enveloping Shield: Your Force Field Shield ability produces an envelope
of force that enfolds you while you are holding the shield, granting you
+1 to Armor. Enabler.

Erase Memories (3 Intellect points): You reach into the mind of a
creature within immediate range and make an Intellect roll. On a
success, you erase up to the last five minutes of its memory. Action.

Escape (2 Speed points): You slip your restraints, squeeze through the
bars, break the grip of a creature holding you, pull free from sucking
quicksand, or otherwise get loose from whatever is holding you in place.
Action.

Escape Plan: When you kill a foe, you can attempt a stealth task to
immediately hide from anyone around, assuming that a suitable hiding
place is nearby. Enabler.

Evanesce (3 Speed points): You step into shadows or behind cover, and
everyone who was observing you completely loses track of you. Although
you’re not invisible, you can’t be seen until you reveal yourself again
by moving out of the shadows or from behind cover (or by making an
attack). Action.

Evasion: You’re hard to affect when you don’t want to be affected. You
are trained in all defense tasks. Enabler.

Everything Is a Weapon: You can take any small object—a coin, a pen, a
bottle, a stone, and so on—and throw it with such force and precision
that it inflicts damage as a light weapon. Enabler.

Exile (5 Intellect points): You send a target that you touch hurtling
into another random dimension or universe, where it remains for ten
minutes. You have no idea what happens to the target while it’s gone,
but at the end of ten minutes, it returns to the precise spot it left.
Action.

Expanded Repertoire: The number of subtle cyphers you can bear at the
same time increases by one. Enabler. 

Experienced Defender: When wearing armor, you gain +1 to Armor. Enabler.

Experienced Finder (6+ Intellect points): When you are looking for
something specific, such as a particular rare component, a chemical
needed to complete a vaccine for a disease, a spare part required to
repair a damaged device, the tracks of a specific beast, or the sword
that a thief stole from you, this ability is of great use. For the next
24 hours, if you come within short range of the thing and circumstances
are such that it is possible for you to perceive the thing (for example,
it’s not in a locked chamber for which you do not have the key), you
find it. This ability assumes that you are constantly on the lookout,
always looking everywhere possible, peering behind obstacles, and so
on—if you’re running for your life, sleeping, or otherwise occupied,
this ability does not help you. You use this ability in lieu of making a
roll to find the thing, but only if the difficulty for finding the
object is level 6 or below. You can apply Effort to increase the maximum
level of the thing you’re trying to find (each level of Effort used this
way increases the maximum level by 1). Action to initiate.

Experienced in Armor: The cost reduction from your Practiced in Armor
ability improves. You now reduce the Speed cost by 2. Enabler.

Expert Crafter: Instead of rolling, you can choose to automatically
succeed on a crafting task you’re trained in. The task must be
difficulty 4 or lower. If you are able to reduce the assessed difficulty
of a crafting task to 4 or lower, this ability also applies to each
subtask, assuming something doesn’t interrupt you during the ensuing
time to build. Enabler.

Expert Cypher Use: You can bear three cyphers at a time. Enabler.

Expert Driver: You are specialized in all tasks related to driving a
car, truck, or motorcycle, including mechanical repair tasks. Enabler.

Expert Follower: You gain a level 3 follower. They are not restricted on
their modifications. You can take this ability multiple times, each time
gaining another level 3 follower. Alternatively, you could choose to
advance a level 2 follower you already have to level 3 and then gain a
new level 2 follower. Enabler.

Expert Pilot: You are specialized in all tasks related to piloting a
starcraft. Enabler.

Expert Skill: Instead of rolling a d20, you can choose to automatically
succeed on a task you’re trained in. The task must be difficulty 4 or
lower, and it can’t be an attack roll or a defense roll. Enabler. (A
character can’t apply Effort or other abilities to any task they
accomplish using Expert Skill.)

Explains the Ineffable: Through anecdotes, historical retellings, and
citing knowledge that few but you have previously understood, you
enlighten your friends. After spending 24 hours with you, once per day,
each of your friends can ease a particular task by two steps. This
benefit is ongoing while you remain in your friends’ company. It ends if
you leave, but it resumes if you return to your friends’ company within
24 hours. If you leave your friends’ company for longer than that, you
must spend another 24 hours together to reactivate the benefit. Enabler.

Exploit Advantage: Even if you can do something well, you’ve learned
that you can always do it even better. Whenever you have an asset for a
roll, you ease the task by one additional step. Enabler.

Exploratory Experience: You are trained in two additional skills in
which you are not already trained. Choose from the following:
navigation, perception, sensing danger, initiative, peacefully opening
communications with strangers, and tracking. Enabler.

Explosive Release (6 Intellect points): You can amplify the energy
stored in your Siphon Pool (from your Store Energy ability) and release
it in a massive blast that affects either one target within short range
or everything within immediate range. If you choose a single target, it
takes 2 points of damage for every point in your Siphon Pool. If you
choose an area, everything in the area (except you) takes 1 point of
damage per point in your Siphon Pool (or half that if your attack fails
against them). This drains your Siphon Pool to 0 points. Action.

Extra Recovery: You gain an additional  
one-action recovery each day. Enabler.

Extra Skill: You are trained in one skill of your choice (other than
attacks or defense) in which you are not already trained. You can select
this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose a
different skill. Enabler.

Extra Use (3 Intellect points): You attempt to gain an extra use from an
artifact without triggering a depletion roll. The difficulty of the task
is equal to the level of the artifact. If you crafted the artifact, you
gain an asset to the task. On a failure, the depletion roll occurs
normally. You could also try to use a manifest cypher without burning it
out, but the task is hindered. A failed attempt to gain an additional
use from a manifest cypher destroys it before it can produce the desired
effect. Action.

Extreme Mastery (6 Might or 6 Speed points): When using your chosen
weapon, you can reroll any attack roll you wish and take the better of
the two results. Enabler.

Eye for Detail (2 Intellect points): When you spend five minutes or so
thoroughly exploring an area no larger than a short distance in
diameter, you can ask the GM one question about the area. The GM must
answer you truthfully. You cannot use this more than one time per area
per 24 hours. Action to initiate, five minutes to complete.

Eye Gouge (2 Speed points): You make an attack against a creature with
an eye. The attack is hindered, but if you hit, the creature has trouble
seeing for the next hour. During this time, the creature’s tasks that
rely on sight (which is most tasks) are hindered. Action.

Eyes Adjusted: You can see in extremely dim light as though it were
bright light. You can see in total darkness as if it were extremely dim
light. Enabler.

Abilities—F

Face Morph (2+ Intellect points): You alter your features and coloration
for one hour, hiding your identity or impersonating someone. This
affects only your face, not the rest of your body. You can’t perfectly
duplicate someone else’s face, but you can be accurate enough to fool
someone who knows that person casually. You have an asset in all tasks
involving disguise. You must apply a level of Effort to be able to
impersonate a different species (such as a human morphing into a
humanoid alien). Action.

Familiarize: You can familiarize yourself with a new area if you spend
at least one hour studying a region up to a long distance across that
you are able to directly access and move about in. Once you’ve
familiarized yourself with an area, all your tasks related to
perception, navigation, salvaging and scavenging, defense, and moving
about the area gain an asset. Each time you familiarize yourself with a
new area, you lose focus on a previous area unless you spend 1 XP to
retain the familiarity permanently. Action to initiate, one hour to
complete.

Far Step (2 Intellect points): You leap through the air and land some
distance away. You can jump up, down, or across to anywhere you choose
within long range if you have a clear and unobstructed path to that
location. You land safely. Action.

Fast Kill (2 Speed points): You know how to kill quickly. When you hit
with a melee or ranged attack, you deal 4 additional points of damage.
You can’t make this attack in two consecutive rounds. Action.

Fast Talk (1 Intellect point): When speaking with an intelligent
creature who can understand you and isn’t hostile, you convince that
creature to take one reasonable action in the next round. A reasonable
action must be agreed upon by the GM; it should not put the creature or
its allies in obvious danger or be wildly out of character. Action.

Fast Travel (7 Intellect points): You warp time and space so that you
and up to ten other creatures within immediate distance travel overland
at ten times the normal rate for up to eight hours. At this speed, most
dangerous encounters or regions of rough terrain are ignored, though the
GM may declare exceptions. Outright barriers still present a problem.
Action to initiate.

Faster Wild Magic: If you spend ten minutes preparing your magic, you
can fill any of your open cypher slots with subtle cyphers chosen
randomly by the GM (this time can be part of a ten-minute, one-hour, or
ten-hour recovery action if you are awake for the entire time). You
can’t use this ability again until after you’ve taken a ten-hour
recovery action. You can still use Magical Repertoire to fill your
cypher slots. Action to initiate, ten minutes to complete.

Fearsome Reputation (3 Intellect points): You and those you travel with
have earned a fearsome reputation in some parts. If your foes have heard
of you, affected targets within earshot become afraid, and all attacks
they make against you are hindered until one or more of them
successfully inflicts damage on you or one of your allies, at which time
their fear abates. Action.

Feat of Strength (1 Might point): Any task that depends on brute force
is eased. Examples include smashing down a barred door, tearing open a
locked container, lifting or moving a heavy object, or striking someone
with a melee weapon. Enabler.

Feint (2 Speed points): If you use one action creating a misdirection or
diversion, in the next round you can take advantage of your opponent’s
lowered defenses. Make a melee attack roll against that opponent. You
gain an asset on this attack. If your attack is successful, it inflicts
4 additional points of damage. Action.

Fellow Explorer: You gain a level 2 follower. One of their modifications
must be for tasks related to perception. Enabler.

Fetch (3 Intellect points): You cause an object to disappear and
reappear in your hands or somewhere else nearby. Choose one object that
can fit inside a 5-foot (2 m) cube and that you can see within long
range. The object vanishes and appears in your hands or in an open space
anywhere you choose within immediate range. Action.

Field of Destruction (4 Might points): When you cause an object to
descend one or more steps on the object damage track, you gain 1
additional point of Armor for one minute. Enabler.

Field of Gravity (4 Intellect points): When you wish it, a field of
manipulated gravity around you pulls incoming ranged projectile attacks
to the ground. You are immune to such attacks until your turn in the
next round. You must be aware of an attack to foil it. This ability does
not work on energy attacks. Enabler.

Field-Reinforced Armor: You gain +1 to Armor while wearing the power
armor from your Powered Armor ability. Enabler.

Fiery Hand of Doom (3 Intellect points): While your Shroud of Flame is
active, you can reach into your halo and produce a hand made of animate
flame that is twice the size of a human’s hand. The hand acts as you
direct, floating in the air. Directing the hand is an action. Without a
command, the hand does nothing. It can move a long distance in a round,
but it never moves farther away from you than long range. The hand can
grab, move, and carry things, but anything it touches takes 1 point of
damage per round from the heat. The hand can also attack. It’s a level 3
creature and deals 1 extra point of damage from fire when it attacks.
Once created, the hand lasts for ten minutes. Action to create; action
to direct.

Fight On: You do not suffer the normal penalties for being impaired on
the damage track. If debilitated, instead of suffering the normal
penalty of being unable to take most actions, you can continue to act;
however, all tasks are hindered. Enabler.

Final Defiance: When you would normally be dead, you instead remain
conscious and active for one more round plus one additional round each
time you succeed on a difficulty 5 Might task. During these rounds, you
are debilitated. If you do not receive healing or otherwise gain points
in a Pool during your final round(s) of activity, you are subject to the
effects of Not Dead Yet. Enabler.

Find an Opening (1 Intellect point): You use trickery to find an opening
in your foe’s defenses. If you succeed on a Speed roll against one
creature within immediate range, your next attack against that creature
before the end of the next round is eased. Action.

Find the Guilty: If you have used Designation on a target, you are
trained in tracking them, spotting them when they are hidden or
disguised, or otherwise finding them. Enabler.

Find the Hidden (4+ Intellect points): You see the traceries of objects
as they move through space and time. You can sense the distance and
direction of any specific inanimate object that you once touched. This
takes anywhere from one action to hours of concentration, depending on
what the GM feels is appropriate due to time, distance, or other
mitigating circumstances. However, you don’t know in advance how long it
will take. If you use at least two levels of Effort, once you have
established the distance and direction, you remain in contact with the
object for one hour per level of Effort used. Thus, if it moves, you are
aware of its new position. Action to initiate; action each round to
concentrate.

Find the Way: When you apply Effort to a navigation task because you
don’t know the way, are lost, are attempting to blaze a new route, need
to choose between two or more otherwise similar paths to take, or
something very similar, you can apply a free level of Effort. Enabler.

Finishing Blow (5 Might points): If your foe is prone, stunned, or
somehow helpless or incapacitated when you strike, you inflict 7
additional points of damage on a successful hit. Enabler.

Fire and Ice (4 Intellect points): You cause a target within short range
to become either very hot or very cold (your choice). The target suffers
3 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor) each round for up to three
rounds, although a new roll is required each round to continue to affect
the target. Action to initiate.

Fire Bloom (4+ Intellect points): Fire blooms within long range, filling
an area 10 feet (3 m) in radius and inflicting 3 points of damage on all
affected targets. Effort applied to one attack counts for all attacks
against targets in the area of the bloom. Even on an unsuccessful
attack, a target in the area still takes 1 point of damage. Flammable
objects in the area may catch fire. Action.

Fire Servant (6 Intellect points): While your Shroud of Flame is active,
you reach into your halo and produce an automaton of fire that is your
general shape and size. It acts as you direct each round. Directing the
servant is an action, and you can command it only when you are within
long range of it. Without a command, the servant continues to follow
your previous command. You can also give it a simple programmed action,
such as “Wait here, and attack anyone who comes within short range until
they’re dead.” The servant lasts for ten minutes, is a level 5 creature,
and deals 1 extra point of damage from fire when it attacks. Action to
create; action to direct.

Fire Tendrils (5 Intellect points): When you wish it, your halo (from
your Shroud of Flame ability) sprouts three tendrils of flame that last
for up to ten minutes. As an action, you can use the tendrils to attack,
making a separate attack roll for each. Each tendril inflicts 4 points
of damage. Otherwise, the attacks function as standard attacks. If you
don’t use the tendrils to attack, they remain but do nothing. Enabler.

Fists of Fury: You inflict 2 additional points of damage with unarmed
attacks. Enabler.

Flamboyant Boast (1 Intellect point): You boastfully describe an act
that you will accomplish, and then as part of the same action, you
attempt it. If an average person would find the action difficult (or
impossible) and you succeed on it, creatures who witnessed it who are
not your allies are potentially dazed on their next turn, and all tasks
they attempt are hindered. The GM will help you determine whether your
boast is something that would impress onlookers so significantly. If you
attempt the task you boast about but fail to accomplish it, all your
attempts to affect or attack onlookers who saw you are hindered for
about ten minutes. Enabler.

Flameblade (4 Intellect points): When you wish it, you extend your
Shroud of Flame to cover a weapon you wield in flame for one hour. The
flame ends if you stop holding or carrying the weapon. While the flame
lasts, the weapon inflicts 2 additional points of damage. Enabler.

Flash (4 Intellect points): You create an explosion of energy at a point
within close range, affecting an area up to immediate range from that
point. You must be able to see the location where you intend to center
the explosion. The blast inflicts 2 points of damage to all creatures or
objects within the area. If you apply Effort to increase the damage, you
deal 2 additional points of damage per level of Effort (instead of 3
points); targets in the area take 1 point of damage even if you fail the
attack roll. Action.

Flash Across the Miles (6+ Intellect points): You can move to an open
location on the planet that you’re familiar with almost instantaneously,
transformed into a bolt of lightning. If you apply a level of Effort,
you can attempt to penetrate covered locations that you’re aware of as
long as a route exists from the open air to the area you want to reach
that electricity can easily follow. Action.

Flee (6 Intellect points): All non-allies within short distance who can
hear your dreadful, intimidating words flee from you at top speed for
one minute. Action.

Fleet of Foot (1+ Speed points): You can move a short distance as part
of another action. You can move a long distance as your entire action
for a turn. If you apply a level of Effort to this ability, you can move
a long distance and make an attack as your entire action for a turn, but
the attack is hindered. Enabler.

Flesh of Stone: You have +1 to Armor if you do not wear physical armor.
Enabler.

Flex Lore: After each ten-hour recovery roll when you have access to a
high-technology digital reference library (such as one that might be
found in a starship or in a learning center), choose one field of
knowledge related to a specific planet or some other location. The field
might be habitations, customs, governments, characteristics of the main
species, important figures, and so on. You’re trained in that field
until you use this ability again. You could use this ability with an
area of knowledge you’re already trained in to become specialized.
Enabler.

Flex Skill: At the beginning of each day, choose one task (other than
attacks or defense) on which you will concentrate. For the rest of that
day, you’re trained in that task. You can’t use this ability with a
skill in which you’re already trained to become specialized. Enabler.

Flex Weapon Skill: At the beginning of each day, choose one type of
attack: light bashing, light bladed, light ranged, medium bashing,
medium bladed, medium ranged, heavy bashing, heavy bladed, or heavy
ranged. For the rest of that day, you are trained in attacks using that
type of weapon. You can’t use this ability with an attack skill in which
you’re already trained to become specialized. Enabler.

Flight (4+ Intellect points): You can float and fly through the air for
one hour. For each level of Effort applied, you can affect one
additional creature of your size or smaller. You must touch the creature
to bestow the power of flight. You direct the other creature’s movement,
and while flying, it must remain within sight of you or fall. In terms
of overland movement, a flying creature moves about 20 miles (32 km) per
hour and is not affected by terrain. Action to initiate.

Flight Exertion (3 Might or 3 Speed points): You can fly up to a short
distance as your movement this round. If all you do is move on your
turn, you can fly up to a long distance. Enabler.

Flight Not Fight: If you use your action only to move, all Speed defense
tasks are eased. Enabler.

Fling (4 Intellect points): You violently launch a creature or object
about your size or smaller within short range and send it flying a short
distance in any direction. This is an Intellect attack that inflicts 4
points of damage to the object being flung when it lands or strikes a
barrier. If you aim the primary target at another creature or object
(and succeed on a second attack), the secondary target also takes 4
points of damage. Action.

Flying Companion: You gain a level 3 companion creature that can fly at
the same speed as you; depending on other aspects of your character,
this might be a trained bird, a machine drone, or a helpful strange
creature such as a familiar. This creature accompanies you and acts as
you direct. As a level 3 companion, it has a target number of 9 and 9
health, and it inflicts 3 points of damage. If it’s killed or destroyed,
it takes you one month to find or create a suitable replacement.
Enabler.

Foil Danger (2 Intellect points): You negate one source of potential
danger related to one creature or object that you are aware of within
immediate distance for one round. This could be a weapon or device held
by someone, a trap triggered by a pressure plate, or a creature’s
natural ability (something special, innate, and dangerous, like a
dragon’s fiery breath or a giant cobra’s venom). You can also try to
foil a foe‘s mundane action (such as an attack with a weapon or claw),
so that the action isn‘t made this round. Make your roll against the
level of the attack, danger, or creature. Action.

Font of Healing: With your approval, other creatures can touch you and
regain 1d6 points to either their Might Pool or their Speed Pool. This
healing costs them 2 Intellect points. A single creature can benefit
from this ability only once each day. Enabler.

Force and Accuracy: You inflict 3 additional points of damage with
attacks using weapons that you throw. Enabler.

Force at Distance (4+ Intellect points): You temporarily bend the
fundamental law of gravity around a creature or object (up to twice your
mass) within short range. The target is caught in your telekinetic grip,
and you can move it up to a short distance in any direction each round
that you retain your hold. A creature in your grip can take actions, but
it can’t move under its own power. Each round after the initial attack,
you can attempt to keep your grip on the target by spending 2 additional
Intellect points and succeeding at a difficulty 2 Intellect task. If
your concentration lapses, the target drops back to the ground. In
addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use
Effort to increase the amount of mass you can affect. Each level allows
you to affect a creature or object twice as massive as before. For
example, applying one level of Effort would affect a creature four times
as massive as you, two levels would affect a creature eight times as
massive, three levels would affect a creature sixteen times as massive,
and so on. Action to initiate.

Force Bash (1 Might point): This is a pummeling melee attack you make
with your Force Field Shield. Your attack inflicts 1 less point of
damage than normal but dazes your target for one round, during which
time all tasks it performs are hindered. Enabler.

Force Blast: You figure out how to project blasts of pure force from the
gauntlets of the power armor from your Powered Armor ability. This
allows you to fire a blast of force that inflicts 5 points of damage
with a range of 200 feet  
(60 m). Action.

Force Field (3 Intellect points): You create an invisible energy barrier
around a creature or object you choose within short range. The force
field moves with the creature or object and lasts for ten minutes. If
the target is a creature, they gain +1 to Armor; if the target is an
object, attacks against it are hindered.

Force Field Barrier (3+ Intellect points): You create an opaque,
stationary barrier of solid energy (a force field) within immediate
range. The barrier is 10 feet by 10 feet (3 m by 3 m) and of negligible
thickness. It is a level 2 barrier and lasts for ten minutes. It can be
placed anywhere it fits, whether against a solid object (including the
ground) or floating in the air. Each level of Effort you apply
strengthens the barrier by one level. For example, applying two levels
of Effort creates a level 4 barrier. Action.

Force Field Shield: You manifest a small plane of pure force, which
takes on a shield-like shape with the barest flicker of a thought. You
can dismiss it just as easily. To use the force shield, you must hold it
in one of your hands. You are practiced in using your exotic shield in
one hand as a light melee weapon; however, if you attack with both your
shield and a weapon held in the other hand, both attacks are hindered.
When you are unconscious or sleeping, the force field dissipates.
Enabler. (A shield, including one produced by a force field, provides an
asset to a character’s Speed defense task while it is held in one hand.)

Force to Reckon With: You can break through force fields and energy
barriers as if they were physical walls. Enabler.

Force Wall (5 Intellect points): You can trigger the energy in your
Force Field Shield to expand outward in all directions to create an
immobile plane of solid force up to 20 feet by 20 feet (6 m by 6 m) for
up to one hour or until you take your shield back. (The force shield
becomes the force wall.) The plane of the force wall conforms to the
space available. While the force wall remains in place, you cannot use
any of your other abilities that require Force Field Shield. Action to
initiate.

Fortification Builder: Whenever you attempt a crafting task—or help in
the crafting task—to build a wall or other fortification, you ease the
crafting difficulty by two steps, to a minimum of difficulty 1. Enabler.

Fortified Position (2 Might points): For the next minute, you gain +1
Armor and an asset to your Might defense tasks, as long as you haven’t
moved more than an immediate distance since your last turn. Action to
initiate.

Foul Aura (5+ Intellect points): Your words, gestures, and touch invest
an object no larger than yourself with an aura of doom, fear, and doubt
for one day. Creatures that can hear and understand you feel an urge to
move at least a short distance away from the object. If a creature does
not move away, all tasks, attacks, and defenses it attempts while within
the aura are hindered. The duration of the aura is extended by one day
per level of Effort applied. The aura is temporarily blocked while the
object is covered or contained. Action to initiate.

Freakishly Large: Your increased size intimidates most people. While you
enjoy the effects of Enlarge, all intimidation tasks you attempt are
eased. Enabler.

Free to Move: You ignore all movement penalties and adjustments due to
terrain or other obstacles. You can fit through any space large enough
to fit your head. Tasks involving breaking free of bonds, a creature’s
grip, or any similar impediment gain three free levels of Effort.
Enabler.

Freezing Touch (4 Intellect points): Your hands become so cold that your
touch freezes solid a living target of your size or smaller, rendering
it immobile for one round. If you have another cold ability activated by
touch (such as Frost Touch), you can use it as part of the Freezing
Touch attack. Action.

Frenzy (1 Intellect point): When you wish, while in combat, you can
enter a state of frenzy. While in this state, you can’t use Intellect
points, but you gain +1 to your Might Edge and your Speed Edge. This
effect lasts as long as you wish, but it ends if no combat is taking
place within range of your senses. Enabler.

Friendly Help: If your friend tries a task and fails, they can try again
without spending Effort if you help. You provide this advantage to your
friend even if you are not trained in the task that they are retrying.
Enabler.

From the Shadows: If you successfully attack a creature that was
previously unaware of your presence, you deal 3 additional points of
damage. Enabler.

Frost Touch (1 Intellect point): Your hands become so cold that the next
time you touch a creature, you inflict 3 points of damage.
Alternatively, you can use this ability on a weapon, and for ten
minutes, it inflicts 1 additional point of damage from the cold. Action
for touch; enabler for weapon.

Further Mathematics: You are specialized in higher mathematics. If you
are already specialized, choose some other sphere of knowledge to become
trained in. Enabler.

Fury (3 Might points): For the next minute, all melee attacks you make
inflict 2 additional points of damage. Action to initiate.

Fusion: You can fuse your manifest cyphers and artifacts with your body.
These fused devices function as if they were one level higher. Enabler.

Fusion Armor: A procedure gives you biometal implants in major portions
of your body, you grow metal-hard skin, the blessings of an angel
protect you, or something similar happens. These changes give you +1 to
Armor even when you’re not wearing physical armor. Enabler.

Abilities—G

Gain Unusual Companion: You gain a special specimen as a constant
companion. It is level 4, probably the size of a small dog, and follows
your telepathic commands. You and the GM must work out the details of
your creature, and you’ll probably make rolls for it in combat or when
it takes actions. The companion acts on your turn. If your companion
dies, you can hunt in the wild for 1d6 days to find a new one. Enabler.

Gambler: Each day, choose two different numbers from 2 to 16. One number
is your lucky number, and the other is your unlucky number. Whenever you
make a roll that day and get a number matching your lucky number, your
next task is eased. Whenever you make a roll that day and get a number
matching your unlucky number, your next task is hindered. Enabler.

Game Lessons: You’ve played so many games that you’ve picked up some
real knowledge. Choose any two noncombat skills. You are trained in
those skills. Enabler.

Gamer: Pick any one style of game such as real-time strategy games,
games of chance in the style of poker, roleplaying games, and so on. You
can apply an asset to a task related to playing that style of game once
between each recovery roll. Enabler.

Gamer’s Fortitude: Sitting and playing a game for twelve hours straight
is not something most people can do, but you’ve figured it out. Once
after each ten-hour recovery roll, you can transfer up to 5 points
between your Pools in any combination, at a rate of 1 point per round.
For example, you could transfer 3 points of Might to Speed and 2 points
of Intellect to Speed, which would take a total of five rounds. Action.

Gaming God: Any time you use Effort on an Intellect action, add one of
the following enhancements to the action (your choice):

Free level of Effort

Automatic minor effect

Enabler.

Gargantuan: When you use Enlarge, you can choose to grow up to 30 feet
(9 m) in height, and you add 3 more temporary points to your Might Pool
(if you also have the Bigger ability, the temporary points from
Gargantuan are in addition to the points from Bigger). Enabler.

Gather Intelligence (2 Intellect points): When in a group of people (a
caravan, a palace, a village, a city, etc.) you can ask around about any
topic you choose and come away with useful information. You can ask a
specific question, or you can simply obtain general facts. You also get
a good idea of the general layout of the location involved, note the
presence of all major sites, and perhaps even notice obscure details.
For example, not only do you find out if anyone in the palace has seen
the missing boy, but you also get a working knowledge of the layout of
the palace itself, note all the entrances and which are used more often
than others, and take notice that everyone seems to avoid the well in
the eastern courtyard for some reason. Action to initiate, about an hour
to complete.

Generate Force Field (9+ Intellect points): You create six planes of
solid force (level 8), each 30 feet (9 m) to a side, which persist for
one hour. The planes must be contiguous, and they retain the position
that you choose when initiating this ability. For instance, you could
arrange the planes linearly, creating a wall 180 feet (55 m) long, or
you could create a closed cube. The planes conform to the space
available. Each additional level of Effort you apply increases the level
of the barrier by one (to a maximum of level 10) or increases the number
of hours it remains by one. Action to initiate.

Get Away (2 Speed points): After your action on your turn, you move up
to a short distance or get behind or beneath cover within immediate
range. Enabler.

Ghost (4 Intellect points): For the next ten minutes, you gain an asset
to sneaking tasks. During this time, you can move through solid barriers
(but not energy barriers) at a rate of 1 foot (30 cm) per round, and you
can perceive while phased within a barrier or object, which allows you
to peek through walls. Action to initiate.

Go Defensive (1 Intellect point): When you wish, while in combat, you
can enter a state of heightened awareness of threat. While in this
state, you can’t use points from your Intellect Pool, but you gain +1 to
your Speed Edge and gain two assets to Speed defense tasks. This effect
lasts as long as you wish or until you attack a foe or no combat is
taking place within range of your senses. Once the effect of this
ability ends, you can’t enter it again for one minute. Enabler.

Go to Ground (4 Speed points): You move up to a long distance and
attempt to hide. When you do, you gain an asset on the stealth task to
blend in, disappear, or otherwise escape the senses of everyone
previously aware of your presence. Action.

Goad (1 Intellect point): You can attempt to goad a target into a
belligerent—and probably foolish—reaction that requires the target to
try to close the distance between you and attempt to physically strike
you on its next turn. They attempt this action even if this would cause
them to break formation or to give up cover or a tactically superior
position. Whether the target strikes you or fails to do so, they come to
their senses immediately afterward, after which further tasks attempting
to goad the target again are hindered. Action to initiate.

Golem Body: You gain +1 to Armor, +1 to your Might Edge, and 5
additional points to your Might Pool. You do not need to eat, drink, or
breathe (though you do need rest and sleep). You move more stiffly than
a creature of flesh, which means you can never be trained or specialized
in Speed defense rolls. Furthermore, you are practiced in using your
stone fists as a medium weapon. Enabler.

Golem Grip (3 Might points): Your attack with the stone fists from your
Golem Body ability is eased. If you hit, you can grab the target,
preventing it from moving on its next turn. While you hold the target,
its attacks or attempts to break free are hindered. If the target
attempts to break free instead of attacking, you must make a Might-based
roll to maintain your grip. If the target fails to break free, you can
continue to hold it each round as your subsequent actions, automatically
inflicting 4 points of damage each round by squeezing. Enabler.

Golem Healing: Your stone form from the Golem Body ability is more
difficult to repair than flesh, which means you are unable to use the
first, single-action recovery roll of the day that other PCs have access
to. Thus, your first recovery roll on any given day requires ten minutes
of rest, the second requires an hour of rest, and the third requires ten
hours. Enabler.

Golem Stomp (4 Might points): You stomp on the ground with all of your
strength, creating a shock wave that attacks all creatures in immediate
range. Affected creatures take 3 points of damage and are either pushed
out of immediate range or fall down (your choice). Action.

Good Advice: Anyone can help an ally, easing whatever task they’re
attempting. However, you have the benefit of clarity and wisdom. When
you help another character, they gain an additional asset. Enabler.

Got a Feeling (4 Intellect points): You have an uncanny intuition when
it comes to finding things. While exploring, you can extend your senses
up to 1 mile (1.5 km) in any direction and ask the GM a very simple,
general question—usually a yes-or-no question—about that area, such as
“Is there an orc encampment nearby?” or “Is there dark matter to be
found in that rusted hulk?” If the answer you seek is not in the area,
you receive no information. Action.

Grab: While you are using the Enlarge ability, you can attack by
attempting to wrap your massive hands around a target the size of a
normal human or smaller. While you maintain your hold as your action,
you keep the target from moving or taking physical actions (other than
attempts to escape). The target’s escape attempt is hindered by two
steps due to your size. If you wish, you can automatically inflict 3
points of damage each round on the target while you hold it, but you can
also keep it protected (by taking all attacks otherwise meant for the
target). Action.

Grand Deception (3 Intellect points): You convince an intelligent
creature that can understand you and isn’t hostile of something that is
wildly and obviously untrue. Action.

Grandiose Illusion (8 Intellect points): You create a fantastically
complex scene of images that fit within a 1-mile (1.5 km) cube that you
are also within. You must be able to see the images when you create
them. The images can move in the cube and act in accordance with your
desires. They can also act logically (such as reacting appropriately to
fire or attacks) when you aren’t directly observing them. The illusion
includes sound and smell. For example, armies can clash in battle, with
air support from machines or flying creatures, on and above terrain of
your creation. The illusion lasts for one hour (or longer, if you
concentrate on it after that time). Action.

Granite Wall (7+ Intellect points): You create a level 6 granite wall
within short range. The wall is 1 foot (30 cm) thick and up to 20 feet
by 20 feet (6 m by 6 m) in size. It appears resting on a solid
foundation and lasts for about ten hours. If you apply three levels of
Effort, the wall is permanent until destroyed naturally. Action to
initiate.

Grasping Foliage (3+ Intellect points): Roots, branches, grass, or other
natural foliage in the area snags and holds a foe you designate within
short range for up to one minute. A foe caught in the grasping foliage
can’t move from its position, and all physical tasks, attacks, and
defenses are hindered, including attempts to free itself. In addition to
the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to
deal damage with the initial attack. Each level applied inflicts 2
additional points of damage when Grasping Foliage first snags and holds
your foe.

You can also use this ability to clear an area of entangling growth in
the immediate radius, such as an area of tall grass, thick brush,
impenetrable vines, and so on. Action.

Gravity Cleave (3 Intellect points): You can harm a target within short
range by rapidly increasing gravity’s pull on one portion of the target
and decreasing it on another, inflicting 6 points of damage. Action.

Great Tree: When you use Wooden Body, you may grow to up to 12 feet (4
m) in height. In this larger form, you add 7 points to your Might Pool
and +2 to your Might Edge. If you chose to grow, when Wooden Body ends
you subtract 7 points from your Might Pool (if this brings the Pool to
0, subtract the overflow first from your Speed Pool and then, if
necessary, from your Intellect Pool). When you use Wooden Body, whether
or not you choose to grow, instead of looking like a wooden version of
your normal self, you can take on the full appearance of a humanoid tree
creature or an actual tree (including growing additional branches, extra
foliage, and so on). This does not affect any of your abilities—in tree
shape, you can use type abilities, other focus abilities, and so on. In
tree shape, pretending to be a tree and hiding among normal trees are
eased by two steps. Enabler.

Greater Beast Form: When using Beast Form, your beast form gains the
following additional bonuses: +1 to your Might Edge, +2 to your Speed
Pool, and +1 to your Speed Edge. Enabler.

Greater Controlled Change: It’s easier to change into and out of the
shape granted by your Beast Form ability. Transforming either way is now
a difficulty 2 Intellect task. Enabler.

Greater Designation: You can assign an innocent or guilty label to all
creatures within immediate range when you use Designation. The one label
applies to all affected creatures. This lasts until you use Greater
Designation again. Action.

Greater Enhanced Intellect: You gain 6 points to your Intellect Pool.
Enabler.

Greater Enhanced Might: You gain 6 points to your Might Pool. Enabler.

Greater Enhanced Physique: You gain 6 points to divide among your Might
and Speed Pools however you wish. Enabler.

Greater Enhanced Potential: You gain 6 points to divide among your stat
Pools however you wish. Enabler.

Greater Enhanced Speed: You gain 6 points to your Speed Pool. Enabler.

Greater Frenzy (4 Intellect points): When you wish, while in combat, you
can enter a state of frenzy. While in this state, you can’t use
Intellect points, but you gain +2 to your Might Edge and your Speed
Edge. This effect lasts as long as you wish, but it ends if no combat is
taking place within range of your senses. If you have the Frenzy
ability, you can use it or this ability, but you can’t use both at the
same time. Enabler.

Greater Healing Touch (4 Intellect points): You touch a creature and
restore its Might Pool, Speed Pool, and Intellect Pool to their maximum
values, as if it were fully rested. A single creature can benefit from
this ability only once each day. Action.

Greater Necromancy (5+ Intellect points): This ability works like the
Necromancy ability except that it creates a level 3 creature. Action to
animate.

Greater Skill With Attacks: Choose one type of attack, even one in which
you are already trained: light bashing, light bladed, light ranged,
medium bashing, medium bladed, medium ranged, heavy bashing, heavy
bladed, or heavy ranged. You are trained in attacks using that type of
weapon. If you’re already trained in that type of attack, you instead
are specialized in that type of attack. Enabler.

Greater Skill With Defense: Choose one type of defense task, even one in
which you are already trained: Might, Speed, or Intellect. You are
trained in defense tasks of that type, or specialized if you are already
trained. You can select this ability up to three times. Each time you
select it, you must choose a different type of defense task. Enabler.

Group Friendship (4 Intellect points): You convince a sentient creature
to regard you (and up to ten creatures that you designate within
immediate distance of you) positively, as they would a potential friend.
Action.

Guide Bolt (4+ Intellect points): When you make  
an attack with a metallic bolt or metal-tipped arrow on a target within
short range, you can improve the attack’s aim and velocity, which grants
an asset to the attack and inflicts an additional 2 points of damage. If
you apply a level of Effort, you grant the same benefits to a ranged
attack made by an ally within immediate range. In any case, you can use
this ability only once per round. Enabler.

Guild Training: Your type abilities that have durations last twice as
long. Your type abilities that have short ranges reach to long range
instead. Your type abilities that inflict damage deal 1 additional point
of damage. Enabler.

Gunner: You inflict 1 additional point of damage with guns. Enabler.

Abilities—H

Hack the Impossible (3 Intellect points): You can persuade robots,
machines, and computers to do your bidding. You can discover an
encrypted password, break through security on a website, briefly turn
off a machine such as a surveillance camera, or disable a robot with a
moment’s worth of fiddling. Action.

Hacker (2 Intellect points): You gain quick access to a desired bit of
information in a computer or similar device, or you access one of its
primary functions. Action.

Hand to Eye (2 Speed points): This ability provides an asset to any
tasks involving manual dexterity, such as pickpocketing, lockpicking,
games involving agility, and so on. Each use lasts up to a minute; a new
use (to switch tasks) replaces the previous use. Action to initiate.

Handy: You work for a living and are trained in tasks related to
carpentry, plumbing, and electrical repair. Your knowledge in these
realms also gives you an asset to craft entirely new items within your
spheres of knowledge and the limits of possibility within the setting.
Enabler.

Hard Choices: Sometimes, you believe that you’ve got to lie to those who
trust you for their own good. You are specialized in deception tasks.
Enabler.

Hard Target: If you move a short distance or farther on your turn, all
Speed defense rolls are eased. Enabler.

Hard to Distract: You are trained in Intellect defense tasks. Enabler.

Hard to Hit: You are trained in Speed defense tasks. Enabler.

Hard to Kill: You can choose to reroll any defense task you make but
never more than once per round. Enabler.

Hard to See: When you move, you are a blur. It is impossible to make out
your identity as you run past, and in a round where you do nothing but
move, stealth tasks and Speed defense tasks are eased. Enabler.

Hard-Won Resilience: In your explorations of dark places, you’ve been
exposed to all sorts of terrible things and are developing a general
resistance. You gain +1 to Armor and are trained in Might defense tasks.
Enabler.

Harder Light: When you create an object out of hard light, the object is
one level higher than normal. Enabler.

Hardiness: You are trained in Might defense tasks. Enabler.

Have Spacesuit, Will Travel: Somehow or another, you became the legal
owner of a fully functional and advanced spacesuit. The spacesuit
provides +1 Armor and, more important, allows you to survive in the
vacuum of space using suit reserves for up to twelve hours at a time
with enough reaction mass to get around in zero gravity on jets of
ionized gas for that same period. After each use, the suit must be
recharged, either with already-charged cartridges of air and reaction
mass or by allowing the suit to sit idle in an area with breathable
atmosphere for at least two hours, during which time it will recharge
both air and reaction mass using integrated solid state mechanisms. The
suit’s power supply is a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, which
means it’ll function for a few decades before needing to be changed out.
Enabler.

Heads-Up Display (2+ Intellect points): Your Powered Armor ability comes
with systems that help you make sense of, analyze, and use your weapons
in your environment. When you trigger this ability, you gain an asset on
one attack roll as the suit perfectly outlines foes and steadies your
aim, regardless of whether you’re making a melee or ranged attack.

Alternatively, you can use the heads-up display to magnify your vision,
increasing your vision range to 5 miles (8 km) for two rounds. If you
apply one level of Effort, you can also see through mundane materials
(such as wood, concrete, plastic, and stone) to a short distance in
false color images. If you apply two levels of Effort, you can see
through special materials (such as solid lead or other substances) to an
immediate distance in false color images; however, the GM might require
you to succeed at an Intellect-based task first, depending on the
material blocking your armor’s sensors.

Enabler.

Healing Pulse (3 Intellect points): You and all targets you choose
within immediate range gain the immediate benefits of using one of their
recovery rolls (as long as it is not their ten-hour recovery roll)
without having to spend an action, ten minutes, or one hour. Targets
regain points to their Pools immediately but mark off that recovery use.
PCs who have already used up their one-action, ten-minute, and one-hour
recovery rolls for the day gain no benefit from this ability. NPCs
targeted by this ability regain a number of health points equal to their
level. Action.

Healing Touch (1 Intellect point): With a touch, you restore 1d6 points
to one stat Pool of any creature. This ability is a difficulty 2
Intellect task. Each time you attempt to heal the same creature, the
task is hindered by an additional step. The difficulty returns to 2
after that creature rests for ten hours. Action.

Hedge Magic (1 Intellect point): You can perform small tricks:
temporarily change the color or basic appearance of a small object,
cause small objects to float through the air, clean a small area, mend a
broken object, prepare (but not create) food, and so on. You can’t use
Hedge Magic to harm another creature or object. Action.

Heightened Skills: You are trained in two tasks of your choosing (other
than attacks or defense). If you choose a task you’re already trained
in, you instead become specialized in that task. You can’t choose a task
you’re already specialized in. Enabler.

Hemorrhage (2+ Might points): You make a powerful and precise strike
that inflicts additional damage later. On your next turn, the target of
this attack takes an additional 3 points of damage (ignores Armor). The
target can prevent this additional damage by making a recovery roll,
using any ability that heals it, or using its action to attend to the
injury. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can
choose to use Effort to increase this duration by one round. Action.

Heroic Monster Bane: When you inflict damage to creatures more than
twice as large or massive as you, you inflict 3 additional points of
damage. Enabler.

Hidden Closet: The magic ally from your Bound Magic Creature ability can
store items for you within its bound object, including extra sets of
clothing, tools, food, and so on. The interior of the object is, in
effect, a 10-foot (3 m) square pocket dimension that normally only the
magic ally can access. Enabler.

Hidden Reserves: When you use an action to make a recovery roll, you
also gain +1 to both your Might Edge and your Speed Edge for ten minutes
thereafter. Enabler.

Higher Mathematics: You are trained in standard and higher mathematics.
Enabler.

Hold Breath: You can hold your breath for up to five minutes. Enabler.

Horde Fighting: When two or more foes attack you at once in melee, you
can use them against each other. You gain an asset to Speed defense
rolls or attack rolls (your choice each round) against them. Enabler.

Horde Tactics (7 Might points): For up to one hour a day, you and at
least three other allies can act like a single creature. Use your stats,
but add +8 to your Might Pool, +1 to your Might Edge, +2 to your Speed
Pool, +1 to your Speed Edge, and +1 to your Armor. Enabler.

Hover (2 Intellect points): You float slowly into the air. If you
concentrate, you can control your movement to remain motionless in the
air or float up to a short distance as your action; otherwise, you drift
with the wind or with any momentum you have gained. This effect lasts
for up to ten minutes. Action to initiate.

How Others Think: You have a sense of how people think. You’re trained
in one of the following tasks: persuasion, deception, or detecting
falsehoods. Enabler.

Huge: When you use Enlarge, you can choose to grow up to 16 feet (5 m)
in height. When you do, you add +1 to Armor (a total of +2 to Armor) and
deal 2 additional points of damage with melee attacks. Enabler.

Hunter’s Drive (5 Intellect points): Through force of will, when you
wish it, you grant yourself greater prowess in the hunt for ten minutes.
During this time, you gain an asset to all tasks involving your quarry,
including attacks. Your quarry is the creature you selected with your
Quarry ability. Enabler.

Hurl Flame (2 Intellect points): While your Shroud of Flame is active,
you can reach into your halo and hurl a handful of fire at a target.
This is a ranged attack with short range that deals 4 points of fire
damage. Action.

Abilities—I

Ice Armor (1 Intellect point): When you wish it, your body is covered in
a sheen of ice for ten minutes that gives you +1 to Armor. While the
sheen is active, you feel no discomfort from normal cold temperatures
and have an additional +2 to Armor versus cold damage specifically.
Enabler.

Ice Creation (4+ Intellect points): You create a solid object of ice
that is your size or smaller. The object is crude and can have no moving
parts, so you can make a sword, a shield, a short ladder, and so on.
Your ice objects are as strong as iron, but if you’re not in constant
contact with them, they function for only 1d6 + 6 rounds before breaking
or melting. For example, you can make and wield an ice sword, but if you
give it to another PC, the sword won’t last as long for that character.
In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to
use Effort to create objects larger than you. For each level of Effort
used in this way, you can create an object up to twice again as large as
you. Action.

Ice Storm: You attempt an additional Intellect task as part of your Cold
Burst attack, and if successful, you blind foes for up to one minute
with a layer of freezing ice. All tasks of blinded creatures are
hindered by two steps. Enabler.

Ignition (4 Intellect points): You designate a creature or flammable
object you can see within short range to catch fire. This is an
Intellect attack. The target takes 6 points of ambient damage per round
until the flames are extinguished, which a creature can do by dousing
itself in water, rolling on the ground, or smothering the flames.
Usually, putting out the flames takes an action. Action to initiate.

Ignore Affliction (5 Might points): If you are affected by an unwanted
condition or affliction (such as disease, paralysis, mind control,
broken limb, and so on, but not damage), you can ignore it and act as if
it does not affect you for one hour. If the condition would normally
last less than an hour, it is entirely negated. Action.

Ignore the Pain: You ignore the impaired condition and treat the
debilitated condition as impaired. Enabler.

Illuminating Touch (1 Intellect point): You touch an object, and that
object sheds light to illuminate everything in short range. The light
remains until you use an action to touch the object again, or until
you’ve illuminated more objects than you have tiers, in which case the
oldest objects you illuminated go dark first. Action.

Illusory Disguise (2+ Intellect points): You appear to be someone or
something else, roughly of your size and shape, for up to one hour. Once
created, the disguise requires no concentration. For each additional
Intellect point you spend, you can disguise one other creature. All
disguised creatures must stay within sight of you or lose their
disguise. Action to create.

Illusory Duplicate (2 Intellect points): You create a single image of
yourself within immediate range. The image looks like you as you are now
(including how you are dressed). The image can move (for example, you
could make it walk or attack), but it can’t move more than an immediate
distance from where you created it. The illusion includes sound and
smell. It lasts for ten minutes and changes as you direct (no
concentration is needed). If you move beyond short range of the
illusion, it vanishes. Action to create.

Illusory Evasion (5 Intellect points): When you would be hit by an
attack, you teleport an immediate distance away, leaving behind an
illusory copy of yourself to be struck by that attack instead of you.
This destroys the illusion but leaves you unharmed by the attack. If the
attack affects an area and the teleportation can’t get you out of that
area, the attack still affects you normally. Enabler.

Illusory Selves (4 Intellect points): You create four holographic
duplicates of yourself within short range. The duplicates last for one
minute. You mentally direct their actions, and the duplicates aren’t
mirror images—each one can do different things. If struck violently,
they either disappear permanently or freeze motionless (your choice).
Action to create.

Immovable: You gain +3 to your Might Pool. You can attempt a Might task
to avoid being knocked down, pushed back, or moved against your will
even if the effect attempting to move you doesn’t allow it. If you apply
Effort to this task, you can apply two free levels of Effort. Enabler.

Impart Ideal (3 Intellect points): After interacting for at least one
minute with a creature who can hear and understand you, you can attempt
to temporarily impart an ideal to it that you could not otherwise
convince it to adopt. An ideal is different than a specific suggestion
or command; an ideal is an overarching value such as “All life is
sacred,” “My political party is the best,” “Children should be seen, not
heard,” and so on. An ideal influences a creature’s behavior but doesn’t
control it. The imparted ideal lasts as long as befits the situation,
but usually at least a few hours. The ideal is jeopardized if someone
friendly to the creature spends a minute or more bringing it back to its
senses. Action.

Impart Understanding: Your Learning the Path ability works more
effectively, allowing you to ease a task by two steps or to provide two
assets to a friend’s task, instead of easing normally. Enabler.

Impersonate (2 Intellect points): For one hour, you alter your voice,
posture, and mannerisms, whip together a disguise, and gain an asset on
an attempt to impersonate someone else, whether it is a specific
individual (Bob the cop) or a general role (a police officer). Action to
initiate.

Impetus (2 Intellect points): A loose object within short range that you
could carry in one hand is drawn to your free hand. If the object is
stuck or held by another creature, you must succeed on a Might roll to
rip it free, or the object remains where it is. Action.

Impossible Walk (5+ Speed points): You can walk (or crawl or run) on
steep inclines and horizontal surfaces (such as walls and cliffs) for
the next minute as if they were flat ground. When using this ability,
“down” for you is either the surface you are walking on or the normal
orientation of gravity (your choice). If you apply one level of Effort,
you can also walk on the ceiling or on a liquid or semi-liquid surface
such as water, mud, quicksand, or even lava (although touching a
dangerous surface like lava still harms you). If you apply two levels of
Effort, you can also walk on air as if it were solid ground. Enabler.

Impressive Display (2 Might points): You perform a feat of strength,
speed, or combat, impressing those nearby. For the next minute you gain
an asset on all interaction tasks with people who saw you use this
ability. Action.

Improved Absorb Kinetic Energy: When you use Absorb Kinetic Energy,
instead of being able to absorb 1 point of damage from a physical attack
or impact, you can absorb 2 points. You can also store up to 2 points of
energy from any source. However, you can still release energy only 1
point at a time. Enabler.

Improved Apportation (6 Intellect points): You call a creature of up to
level 3, which appears next to you. You can choose a creature that
you’ve previously encountered, or (no more than once per day) you can
allow the GM to determine the creature randomly. If you call a random
creature, it has a 10 percent chance of being a creature of up to level
5. The creature has no memory of anything before being called by you,
though it can speak and has the general knowledge a creature of its type
should possess. The creature is receptive to communication and helping
you (unless shown that it should do otherwise). Action.

Improved Command Spirit: When you use your Command Spirit ability, you
can command a spirit or animate undead creature of up to level 7.  
Enabler.

Improved Companion: Your companion (such as a controlled beast) or
follower increases to level 4. As a level 4 creature, it has a target
number of 12 and 12 health, and it inflicts 4 points of damage (though
in most cases, instead of attacking, it provides an asset to your
attacks). You can gain this ability once per tier. Each additional time
you select it, it increases your companion or follower’s level by 1.
Enabler.

Improved Copying: You can use Copy Power to copy more powerful
abilities. In addition to the normal options for using Effort with Copy
Power, if you apply one level of Effort, the GM chooses a mid-tier
ability that most closely resembles that power (instead of a low-tier
ability). Enabler.

When you use Improved Copying, a copied ability must be low, medium, or
high tier according to how it is listed in the ability categories. It
doesn’t matter if a type or focus makes it available at a lower or
higher tier.

Improved Designation: When you use Designation, you can designate one
additional creature to be innocent or guilty, which means up to two
creatures at a time may be innocent, or two guilty, or one innocent and
one guilty. Enabler.

Improved Edge: Choose one of your Edge stats that is 0. It increases
to 1. Enabler.

Improved Gravity Cleave (9 Intellect points): You can harm a group of
targets within long range by rapidly increasing gravity’s pull on one
portion of each target and decreasing it on another, inflicting 6 points
of damage. The targets must be within immediate range of each other.
Action.

Improved Machine Companion: The machine from your Machine Companion
ability improves, becoming a level 5 creature with the ability either to
fly a long distance each round (and carry you) for up to ten minutes at
a time, or to carry an extra cypher for you that doesn’t count against
your cypher limit. Enabler.

Improved Monster Bane: When you inflict damage to creatures more than
twice as large or massive as you, you inflict 3 additional points of
damage. Enabler.

Improved Object Bond (5 Intellect points): When you manifest the ally
from your Bound Magic Creature ability, it is now a level 4 creature.
Also, the creature gains a pulse attack that renders all artifacts,
machines, manifest cyphers, and lesser magic devices within short range
inoperable for one minute. After the creature uses this ability, it must
retreat to its object to rest for three hours. Enabler.

Improved Recovery: Your ten-minute recovery roll takes only one action
instead, so that your first two recovery rolls are one action, the third
is one hour, and the fourth is ten hours. Enabler.

Improved Sculpt Light (7+ Intellect points): You create an object of
solid light in any shape you can imagine whose base size can fit within
a 10-foot (3 m) cube. The object appears in an area adjacent to you or
floating freely in space up to a long distance away, and the object
lasts for a few days. The object is crude and can have no moving parts,
so you can make a wall segment, a block, a box, stairs, and so on. The
sculpted object has the approximate mass of the real object and is level
6. If you apply Effort to increase the size of the object, each level
applied increases the size by an additional 10-foot (3 m) cube. Action.

Improved Sensor (2 Intellect points): When you use Sensor, you can place
the sensor anywhere you choose within long range. Enabler.

Improved Success: When you roll a 17 or higher on an attack roll that
deals damage, you deal 1 additional point of damage. For instance, if
you roll a natural 18, which normally deals 2 extra points of damage,
you instead deal 3 extra points. If you roll a natural 20 and choose to
deal damage instead of achieve a special major effect, you deal 5 extra
points of damage. Enabler.

Improvise (3 Intellect points): When you perform a task in which you are
not trained, you can improvise to gain an asset on the task. The asset
might be a tool you cobble together, a sudden insight into overcoming a
problem, or a rush of dumb luck. Enabler. (Improvise can be used on a
task a character has an inability in, but instead of gaining an asset,
the character just loses the inability penalty.)

In Harm’s Way (3 Intellect points): When you put your friends before
yourself as your action, you ease all defense tasks for all characters
you choose that are adjacent to you. This lasts until the end of your
next turn. If one of your friends would be damaged, you can choose to
take up to half the number of points of damage they would otherwise
take, but only if you’re not already impaired or debilitated. Enabler.

Incomparable Pilot: While on a starcraft you own or have a direct
connection with, your Might Edge, Speed Edge, and Intellect Edge
increase by 1. When you make a recovery roll on a starcraft you’re
familiar with, you recover 5 additional points. Enabler.

Increased Effects: You treat rolls of natural 19 as rolls of natural 20
for either Might actions or Speed actions (your choice when you gain
this ability). This allows you to gain a major effect on a natural 19 or
20. Enabler.

Increasing Determination: If you fail at a noncombat physical task
(pushing open a door or climbing a cliff, for example) and then retry
the task, the task is eased. If you fail again, you gain no special
benefits. Enabler.

Incredible Feat of Science (12 Intellect points): You do something
amazing in the lab. This takes parts and materials equivalent to three
expensive items. Possible incredible feats include:

Reanimate and command a dead body for one hour.

Create an engine that runs on perpetual motion.

Create a teleportation gate that remains open for one minute.

Transmute one substance into another substance.

Cure one person with an incurable disease or condition.

Create a weapon designed to hurt something that can’t otherwise be hurt.

Create a defense designed to protect against something that can’t
otherwise be stopped.

Action to initiate; a full day of work to complete.

Incredible Health: Thanks to a dip in a magical pool, an injection of
artificial antibodies and immune defense nanobots into your bloodstream,
exposure to strange radiation, or something else, you are now immune to
diseases, viruses, and mutations of any kind. Enabler.

Incredible Recovery (6 Might points): You move up one step on the damage
track or shake off any unwanted ongoing condition. Action.

Incredible Running Speed: You move much farther than normal in a round.
This means as a part of another action, you can move up to a long
distance. As an action, you can move up to 200 feet (60 m), or up to 500
feet (150 m) as a Speed-based task with a difficulty of 4. Enabler.

Infer Thoughts (4 Intellect points): If you interact with or study a
target for at least a round, you can attempt to read its surface
thoughts, even if the subject doesn’t want you to. You must be able to
see the target. Once you have gained a sense of what it’s
thinking—through its body language, its speech, and what it does and
doesn’t say—you can continue to infer the target’s surface thoughts for
up to one minute as long as you can still see and hear the target.
Action to prepare; action to initiate.

Inferno Trail (6 Intellect points): For the next minute, you leave a
trail of flame in your wake. The trail matches your path and lasts for
up to a minute, creating a wall of flame about 6 feet (2 m) high that
inflicts 5 points of damage to any creature that passes through it,
potentially catching them on fire for an additional 1 point of damage
each round (if they are flammable) until they spend a round putting out
the fire. Action.

Infiltrator: You are trained in interactions involving lies or trickery.
Enabler.

Influence Swarm (1 Intellect point): You master one type of small
creature (such as insects, rats, bats, or even birds) and they respond
to you in number. Your creatures within short range will not harm you or
those you designate as allies for one hour. Action to initiate.

Information Gathering (5 Intellect points): You speak telepathically
with any or all machines within 1 mile (1.5 km). You can ask one basic
question about themselves or anything happening near them and receive a
simple answer. For example, while in an area with many machines, you
could ask about the location of a specific creature or individual, and
if they are within a mile of you, one or more machines will probably
provide the answer. Action.

Informer: You gain an informer within an allied community. They act as
your secret (or known) informer. If something of note happens in your
informer’s location, they will use whatever means they have available to
tell you about it. Enabler.

Infuse Spirit: When you kill a creature or destroy a spirit with an
attack, if you choose, its spirit (if unprotected) immediately infuses
you, and you regain 1d6 points to one of your Pools (your choice). The
spirit is stored within you, which means it cannot be questioned,
raised, or restored to life by any means unless you allow it. Enabler.

Inhabit Crystal (4 Intellect points): You transfer your body and
whatever you are carrying into a crystal at least the size of your index
finger. While in the crystal, you are aware of what is going on around
it, seeing and hearing through the crystal. You can even speak through
the crystal and carry on conversations. You cannot take actions other
than to exit the crystal. You remain within as long as you wish, but you
are not in stasis and should exit to eat, drink, sleep, and so on as
normal (breathing is not an issue). If the crystal is destroyed or takes
major damage while you are within it, you immediately exit, cannot act
for three rounds, and move two steps down the damage track. Action to
enter and exit. (A character should specify where they place the crystal
for the Inhabit Crystal ability before using it, even if it’s just on
the ground at their feet.)

Innate Power: Choose either your Might Pool or your Speed Pool. When
spending points to activate your focus abilities, you can spend points
from this Pool instead of your Intellect Pool (in which case you use
your Might Edge or Speed Edge instead of your Intellect Edge, as
appropriate). Enabler

Inner Defense: Life’s trials have toughened you and made you hard to
read. You are trained in any task to resist another creature’s attempt
to discern your true feelings, beliefs, or plans. You are likewise
trained in resisting torture, telepathic intrusion, and mind control.
Enabler.

Innovator: You can modify any artifact to give it different or better
abilities as if that artifact were one level lower than normal, and the
modification takes half the normal time. Enabler.

Insect Eruption (6 Intellect points): You call a swarm of insects in a
place where it is possible for insects to appear. They remain for one
minute, and during this time, they do as you command while they are
within long range. They can swarm about and hinder any or all creatures’
tasks, or you can focus the swarm and attack all targets within
immediate range of each other (all within long range of you). The
attacking swarm inflicts 2 points of damage per round. You can also
command the swarm to move heavy objects through collective effort, eat
through wooden walls, and perform other actions suitable for a
supernatural swarm. Action to initiate.

Insight: You are trained in tasks to discern others’ motives and to
ascertain their general nature. You have a knack for sensing whether or
not someone is truly innocent. Enabler.

Inspiration (6 Intellect points): You speak words of encouragement and
inspiration. All allies within short range who can hear you immediately
gain a recovery roll, gain an immediate free action, and have an asset
for that free action. The recovery roll does not count as one of their
normal recovery rolls. Action.

Inspire Action (4 Intellect points): If one ally can see and easily
understand you, you can instruct that ally to take an action. If the
ally chooses to take that exact action, they can do so as an additional
action immediately. Doing so doesn’t interfere with the ally taking a
normal action on their turn. Action.

Inspire Aggression (2 Intellect points): Your words twist the mind of a
character within short range who is able to understand you, unlocking
their more primitive instincts. As a result, they gain an asset on their
Might-based attack rolls for one minute. Action to initiate.

Inspire Coordinated Actions (9 Intellect points): If your allies can see
and easily understand you, you can instruct each of them to take one
specific action (the same action for all of them). If any of them choose
to take that exact action, they can do so as an additional action
immediately. This doesn’t interfere with them taking their normal
actions on their turns. Action.

Inspire the Innocent (3 Intellect points): You speak words of
encouragement and inspiration to everyone within immediate range whom
you have designated as innocent with your Designation ability. They
immediately gain a free recovery roll. One person you choose can gain an
immediate free action instead of a free recovery roll. If you also have
the Inspiration ability, the target who gains a free action also gains
an asset on it. Action.

Inspiring Ease: Through stories, songs, art, or other forms of
entertainment, you inspire your friends. After spending 24 hours with
you, once per day each of your friends can ease a task. This benefit is
ongoing while you remain in the friend’s company. It ends if you leave,
but it resumes if you return to the friend’s company within 24 hours. If
you leave the friend’s company for more than 24 hours, you must spend
another 24 hours together to reactivate the benefit. Enabler.

Inspiring Success (6 Intellect points): When you succeed on a roll to
perform a task related to the stat that you choose upon selecting this
ability, and you applied at least one level of Effort, you may choose
another character within short range. That character has an asset on the
next task they attempt using that stat on their next turn. Enabler.

Intelligent Interface (3 Intellect points): You can speak telepathically
with any intelligent machine within long range. Further, you are trained
in all interactions with intelligent machines. Such machines and robots
that normally would never communicate with a human might talk to you.
Enabler.

Intense Interaction (3 Intellect points): You gain an asset on
intimidating, persuading, and influencing people for ten minutes.
Action.

Interaction Skills: You are trained in two skills in which you are not
already trained. Choose two of the following: deceiving, persuading,
public speaking, seeing through deception, or intimidation. You can
select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must
choose two different skills. Enabler.

Interface: By directly plugging into a device, you can identify and
learn to operate it as though the task were one level lower. Enabler.

Interruption (4 Intellect points): Your vociferous, booming command
prevents a creature within short range from taking any action for one
round. It can defend itself if attacked, but when it does so, its
defense is hindered by two steps. Each additional time you attempt this
ability against the same target, you must apply one more level of Effort
than you applied on the previous attempt. Action.

Inventor: You can create new artifacts in half the time, as if they were
two levels lower, by spending half the normal XP. Enabler.

Investigate: You are trained in perception, cryptography, deceiving, and
breaking into computers. Enabler.

Investigative Skills: You are trained in two skills in which you are not
already trained. Choose two of the following: perception, identifying,
lockpicking, assessing danger, or tinkering with devices. You can select
this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose
two different skills. Enabler.

Investigator: To really shine as an investigator, you must engage your
mind and body in your deductions. You can spend points from your Might
Pool, Speed Pool, or Intellect Pool to apply levels of Effort to any
Intellect-based task. Enabler.

Invisibility (4 Intellect points): You become invisible for ten minutes.
While invisible, you are specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks.
This effect ends if you do something to reveal your presence or
position—attacking, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on.
If this occurs, you can regain the remaining invisibility effect by
taking an action to hide your position. If you have another ability that
also confers invisibility, using either one allows you to remain
invisible for twice as long as the duration specified. Action to
initiate or reinitiate.

Invisible Phasing (4 Might points): You become invisible while using
Phase Sprint and during the following round. While invisible, stealth is
eased by two steps and Speed defense is eased by two steps (this
replaces the asset to Speed defense tasks provided by Phase Sprint). The
first attack you make using any Shreds the Walls of the World attack
abilities is also eased by two steps; however, if you attack a creature,
Invisible Phasing ends immediately instead of lasting for one additional
round. If you have the Invisibility ability, you can remain invisible
during the entire round, which means that if you use Scratch Existence
or Shred Existence, attacking each target along your path is eased by
two steps. Enabler.

Iron Fist: Your unarmed attacks deal 4 points of damage. Enabler.

Iron Punch (5+ Intellect points): You magnetically pick up a metallic
heavy object within short range and hurl it at someone within short
range, an Intellect action that deals 6 points of damage to the target
and to the hurled object. For each additional level of Effort applied,
you can pick up a slightly larger object, allowing you to affect one
additional target within short range as long as it is next to the prior
target. Action.

Abilities—J

Jaunt (5+ Intellect points): You instantaneously teleport yourself to
any location within long distance that you can see. In addition to the
normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to
increase the distance you can travel; each level of Effort used in this
way increases the range by another 100 feet (30 m). Action.

Juggernaut (5 Might points): Until the end of the next round, you can
move through solid objects such as doors and walls. Only 2 feet (60 cm)
of wood, 1 foot (30 cm) of stone, or 6 inches (15 cm) of metal can stop
your movement. Enabler.

Jump Attack (5+ Might points): You attempt a difficulty 4 Might roll to
jump high into the air as part of your melee attack action. If you
succeed at the jump and your attack hits, you inflict 3 additional
points of damage and knock the foe prone. If you fail at the jump, you
still make your normal attack roll, but you don’t inflict the extra
damage or knock down the opponent if you hit. In addition to the normal
options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to enhance your
jump; each level of Effort used in this way adds +2 feet to the height
and +1 damage to the attack. Action.

Junkmonger (2 Intellect points): You are trained in crafting two kinds
of items using scavenged junk. If you have scavenged (or otherwise
obtained) at least two pieces of junk in different categories
(electronic, plastic, dangerous, metallic, glass, or textile), you have
the materials you need to craft a new item in one of your areas of
training (unless the GM deems otherwise). Enabler.

Jury-Rig (5 Intellect points): You quickly create an object using what
would seem to be entirely inappropriate materials. You can make a bomb
out of a tin can and household cleaners, a lockpick out of aluminum
foil, or a sword out of broken furniture. The level of the item
determines the difficulty of the task, but the appropriateness of the
materials eases or hinders it as well. Generally, the object can be no
larger than something you can hold in one hand, and it functions once
(or, in the case of a weapon or similar item, is essentially useful for
one encounter). If you spend at least ten minutes on the task, you can
create an item of level 5 or lower. You can’t change the nature of the
materials involved. For example, you can’t take iron rods and make a
pile of gold coins or a wicker basket. Action.

Just a Bit Mad: You are trained in Intellect defense tasks. Enabler.

Abilities—K

Knock Out (5+ Might points): You make a melee attack that inflicts no
damage. Instead, if the attack hits, make a second Might-based roll. If
successful, a foe of level 3 or lower is knocked unconscious for one
minute. For each level of Effort used, you can affect one higher level
of foe, or you can extend the duration for an additional minute. Action.

Know Their Faults: If a creature that you can see has a special
weakness, such as a vulnerability to loud noises, a negative
modification to perception, and so on, you know what it is. Ask and the
GM will tell you; usually, this is not associated with a roll, but in
certain cases the GM may decide that there is a chance for you not to
know. In these cases, you are specialized in knowing creature
weaknesses. Enabler.

Know Where to Look: Whenever the GM obtains a result for you on the
Useful Stuff table, you get two results instead of one. If the GM is
using some other method to generate rewards for finding valuables, you
should gain double the result you would otherwise obtain. Enabler.

Knowing: You are trained in one area of knowledge of your choice.
Enabler.

Knowing the Unknown (6 Intellect points): By accessing the resources
appropriate to your character, you can ask the GM one question and get a
general answer. The GM assigns a level to the question, so the more
obscure the answer, the more difficult the task. Generally, knowledge
that you could find by looking somewhere other than your current
location is level 1, and obscure knowledge of the past is level 7.
Gaining knowledge of the future is impossible. Action.

Knowledge of the Law: You’re trained in the law of the land. If you
don’t know the answer to a question of law, you know where and how to
research it (a university’s law library is a good place to start, but
you’ve also got online sources). Enabler.

Knowledge Is Power: Choose two noncombat skills in which you are not
trained. You are trained in those skills. Enabler.

Knowledge Skills: You are trained in two skills in which you are not
already trained. Choose two areas of knowledge such as history,
geography, archeology, and so on. You can select this ability multiple
times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills.
Enabler.

Abilities—L

Lab Analysis (3 Intellect points): You analyze the scene of a crime, the
site of a mysterious incident, or a series of unexplained phenomena, and
maybe learn a surprising amount of information about the perpetrators,
the participants, or the force(s) responsible. To do so, you must
collect samples from the scene. Samples are paint or wood scrapings,
dirt, photographs of the area, hair, an entire corpse, and so on. With
samples in hand, you can discover up to three pertinent pieces of
information about the scene, possibly clearing up a lesser mystery and
pointing the way to solving a greater one. The GM will decide what you
learn and what level of difficulty is needed to learn it. (For
comparison, discovering that a victim was killed not by a fall, as seems
immediately obvious, but rather by electrocution, is a difficulty 3 task
for you.) The task is eased if you take the time to transport the
samples to a permanent lab (if you have access to one), as opposed to
conducting the analysis with your field science kit. Action to initiate,
2d20 minutes to complete.

Late Inspiration (3 Intellect points): You retry a task you failed
within the past one minute, using the same difficulty and modifiers,
except this time you have an asset on the task. If this retry fails, you
can’t use this ability to retry it again. Enabler.

Lead by Inquiry: You keep your allies on their toes with occasional
questions, jokes, and even mock drills for those who care to join in.
After spending 24 hours with you, your allies are treated as if trained
in tasks related to perception. This benefit is ongoing while you remain
in your allies’ company. It ends if you leave, but it resumes if you
return to the allies’ company within 24 hours. If you leave the allies’
company for more than 24 hours, you must spend another 24 hours together
to reactivate the benefit. Enabler.

Lead From the Front: You gain 3 new points to divide among your stat
Pools however you wish. Enabler.

Learned a Few Things: You are trained in two areas of knowledge of your
choice, or specialized in one area of knowledge of your choice. Enabler.

Learning the Path (2 Intellect points): You observe or study a creature,
object, or location for at least one round. The next time you interact
with it (possibly in the following round), a related task (such as
persuading the creature, attacking it, or defending from its attack) is
eased. Action.

Legal Intern: You gain a level 4 follower who is mostly interested in
helping with your law-related tasks, but who might also help you in
other areas. Enabler.

Legerdemain (1 Speed point): You can perform small but seemingly
impossible tricks. For example, you can make a small object in your
hands disappear and move into a desired spot within reach (like your
pocket). You can make someone believe that they have something in their
possession that they do not have (or vice versa). You can switch similar
objects right in front of someone’s eyes. Action.

Lend Animal Shape (6+ Intellect points): You change into an animal, and
one willing creature within immediate range also transforms into an
animal of that type (bear, tiger, wolf, and so on) for ten minutes, as
if they were using your Animal Shape ability. For each level of Effort
applied, you can affect one additional creature. All creatures
transforming with you must be your size or smaller. A creature can
revert to its normal form as an action, but it cannot then change back
into the animal form. One creature (whether you or someone else)
changing form does not affect any other creature affected with this
ability. Action.

A creature that takes animal form with Lend Animal Shape counts as an
animal for the use of Animal Scrying.

A character might be able to take the shape of a creature that is
similar to a common animal, such as a unicorn instead of a horse or a
basilisk instead of a lizard, but doing so should require applying at
least one level of Effort to the change, and the character wouldn’t gain
any of the creature’s magical abilities.

Lethal Damage: Choose one of your existing attacks that inflicts points
of damage (depending on your type and focus, this might be a specific
weapon, a special ability such as a blast of fire, or your unarmed
attacks). When you hit with that attack, you inflict an additional 5
points of damage. Enabler.

Lethal Ploy (5+ Intellect points): Long experience has revealed to you
that subterfuge is your friend in desperate situations. You push,
attack, or distract the target in some seemingly inconsequential way
that leads to the target’s death. The target must be level 2 or lower.
In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to
use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target by 1. Thus, to
kill a level 5 target (three levels above the normal limit), you must
apply three levels of Effort. Action.

Lethal Vibration (7 Might points): You set up a lethal vibration in your
own body and pass it to a creature you touch with a successful attack.
If the target is level 2 or lower, it dies, exploding in a peal of
thunder. If the target is level 3 or higher, it sustains 6 points of
damage and is stunned on its next action. If the target is a PC of any
tier, they move down one step on the damage track. In addition to the
normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to affect
a more powerful target (one level of Effort means a target of up to
level 3 explodes and a target of level 4 or higher takes damage and is
stunned, and so on). Action.

Levity: Through wit, charm, humor, and grace, you are trained in all
social interactions other than those involving coercion or intimidation.
During rests, you put friends and comrades at ease so much that they
gain +1 to their recovery rolls. Enabler.

Life Lessons: Choose any two noncombat skills. You are trained in those
skills. Enabler.

Like the Back of Your Hand: All tasks directly related to a starcraft
that you own or have a direct connection with are eased. Tasks include
repair, refueling, finding a breach in the hull, finding a stowaway, and
so on. The same goes for any attack or defense rolls you make within the
starcraft against enemy boarders, as well as any attack or defense rolls
you make with the ship against enemy ships. Enabler.

Link Senses (2 Intellect points): You touch a willing creature and link
its senses to yours for one minute. At any time during that duration,
you can concentrate to see, hear, and smell what that creature is
experiencing, instead of using your own senses. If you or the creature
move out of long range, the connection is broken. Action to initiate.

Living Armor (4 Intellect points): If you’re in a location where it’s
possible for your creatures from Influence Swarm to come, you call a
swarm around you for one hour. They crawl over your body or fly around
you in a cloud. During this time, your Speed defense tasks are eased,
and you gain +1 to Armor. Action to initiate.

Living Light (6+ Intellect points): Your body dissolves into a cloud of
photons that instantly travel to a location you choose and then reform.
You can choose any open space big enough to contain you that you can see
within very long range, or any place you have lit by Illuminating Touch
that is still shining. You disappear and almost instantly reappear in
the space you chose. It takes until the end of the round for your body
to become fully solid, so until the start of the next round, you take a
maximum of 1 point of damage from any given attack or source of damage.
Each level of Effort you apply allows you to bring along one additional
person besides yourself, as long as they are within immediate range when
you depart. Action.

Living Off the Land: Given an hour or so, you can always find edible
food and potable water in the wilderness. You can even find enough for a
small group of people, if need be. Further, since you’re so hardy and
have gained resistance over time, you are trained in resisting the
effects of natural poisons (such as those from plants or living
creatures). You’re also immune to natural diseases. Enabler.

Living Wall (3 Might points): You specify a confined area—such as an
open doorway, a hallway, or a space between two trees—where you stand.
For the next ten minutes, if anyone attempts to enter or pass through
that area and you don’t wish it, you make an automatic attack against
them. If you hit, not only do you inflict damage, but they must also
stop their movement. Enabler.

Lock (2+ Intellect points): A door, gate, chest, drawer, locket, or
other object that can be closed within long range snaps shut and is
magically locked (level 3 effect) for one hour. If an object or creature
is physically holding the target object open, you must also succeed on
an  
Intellect-based attack. For each level of Effort you apply, the quality
of the magical lock increases by one level. Action to initiate.

Lost in the Chaos: When faced with several foes at once, you have
developed tactics for using their numbers against them. When two or more
foes attack you at once in melee, you play one off the other. Speed
defense rolls or attack rolls (your choice) against them are eased.
Enabler.

Lunge (2 Might points): This ability requires you to extend yourself for
a powerful stab or smash. The awkward lunge hinders the attack roll. If
your attack is successful, it inflicts 4 additional points of damage.
Action.

Abilities—M

Machine Affinity: You are trained in tasks involving electrical
machines. Enabler.

Machine Bond: From very long range, you can activate and control a
device (including a robot or vehicle) that you have bonded with. For
example, you can detonate a manifest cypher even when it is held by
someone else, or cause an automated turret to fire where you direct.
Bonding is a process that requires 24 hours of meditation in the
presence of the machine. Action.

Machine Companion: You create a level 3 animate, intelligent machine
that accompanies you and acts as you direct. As a level 3 machine
companion, it has a target number of 9 and 9 health, and it inflicts 3
points of damage. If it’s destroyed, it takes you one month to create a
new one. Enabler.

Machine Efficiency (3 Intellect points): You can make a blaster shoot
farther, coax more speed from a skycycle, improve the clarity of a
camera, jury-rig a light to be brighter, speed up a network connection,
and so on. You increase an object’s level by 2 for one minute, or you
treat the object as an asset that eases an associated task by two steps
for one minute (your choice). Action to initiate.

Machine Enhancement: Any time you use Effort on an Intellect action, add
one of the following enhancements to the action (your choice):

Free level of Effort

Automatic minor effect

Enabler.

Machine Hunting: You are trained in tasks associated with tracking,
spotting, or otherwise finding robots and animate machines. You are also
trained in all stealth tasks. Enabler.

Machine Interface (2 Intellect points): For one minute you gain an asset
on tasks to discern the level, function, and activation of technological
devices that you touch. Enabler.

Machine Telepathy (3 Intellect points): You can read the surface
thoughts of a machine within short range, even if the machine doesn’t
want you to. You must be able to see the machine. Once you have
established contact, you can read the target’s thoughts for up to one
minute. If you or the target move out of range, the connection is
broken. If you have the Mind Reading ability, when you apply Effort to
Machine Telepathy, you gain a free level of Effort. Action to initiate.

Machine Vulnerabilities: You inflict 3 additional points of damage
against robots and animate machines of all kinds. Enabler.

Magic Shield (1 Intellect point): You gain +1 to Armor for an hour.
Action to initiate.

Magic Training: You are trained in the basics of magic (including the
operation of magic artifacts and cyphers) and can attempt to understand
and identify its properties. Enabler.

Magical Repertoire: The number of subtle cyphers you can bear at the
same time increases by two. If you spend one hour preparing your magic,
you can fill any of your open cypher slots with subtle cyphers chosen
randomly by the GM (this hour can be part of a one-hour or ten-hour
recovery action if you are awake for the entire time). As part of this
preparation process, you may discard any number of subtle cyphers you
carry to make room for more subtle cyphers. Enabler.

If a character has Magical Repertoire, the GM should give the PC
frequent opportunities to gain new subtle cyphers, whether from
preparation or by gaining them automatically as explained in the Cyphers
chapter

Magical Training: You are trained in all of your spells. As a result,
you ease any task involved in the use of your spells. Enabler.

Magnetic Field (4 Intellect points): When you wish it, a field of
magnetism around you pulls incoming, ranged, metallic projectile attacks
(such as arrows, bullets, a thrown metal knife, and so on) to the
ground. You are immune to such attacks for one round. You must be aware
of an attack to foil it. Enabler.

Magnificent Moment: If you make an attack or attempt a task with the
immediate action you gain by using Seize the Moment, the attack or task
is eased. Enabler.

Major Illusion (3 Intellect points): You create a complex scene of
images within immediate range. The entire scene must fit within a  
100-foot (30 m) cube. The images can move, but they can’t leave the area
defined by the cube. The illusion includes sound and smell. It lasts for
ten minutes and changes as you direct (no concentration is needed). If
you move beyond immediate range of the cube, the illusion vanishes.
Action to create.

Make Judgment: You are trained in discerning the truth of a situation,
seeing through lies, or otherwise overcoming deception. Enabler.

Maneuvering Adept: If you apply at least one level of Effort to a task
involving climbing, jumping, balancing, or some other kind of
maneuvering, you get a free level of Effort. Enabler.

Mask (5 Intellect points): You transform your body to become someone
else. You can change any physical characteristic you wish, including
coloration, height, weight, gender, and distinguishing markings. You can
also change the appearance of whatever you are wearing or carrying. Your
stats, as well as the stats of your items, do not change. You remain in
this form for up to a day or until you use an action to resume your
normal appearance. Action to initiate.

Master Crafter: You are trained in the crafting of two kinds of items,
or you are specialized in two kinds of items that you are already
trained in. Enabler.

Master Cypher Use: You can bear five cyphers at a time. Enabler.

Master Entertainer: Your Inspiring Ease ability works more effectively,
easing your friends’ tasks by two steps rather than one step. Enabler.

Master Identifier: You are trained in identifying the function of any
kind of device. Enabler.

Master Machine (8 Intellect points): You can control the functions of a
machine you have bonded with using Machine Bond, intelligent or
otherwise. In addition, if you use an action to concentrate on a
machine, you are aware of what is going on around it (you see and hear
as if you were standing next to it, no matter how far away you are). You
must touch the machine to create the bond, but afterward, there is no
range limitation. This bond lasts for one week. You can bond with only
one machine at a time. Action to initiate.

Master of Unarmed Fighting Style: You are specialized in unarmed
attacks. If you are already specialized in unarmed attacks, you instead
deal 2 additional points of damage with unarmed attacks. Enabler.

Master Thief: You are trained in climbing, escaping from bonds, slipping
through narrow places, and other contortionist moves. Enabler.

Masterful Armor Modification: Choose one of the following modifications
to make to the Powered Armor from your Powered Armor ability. If you
choose to make a different modification later, you can do so, but you
must spend 2 XP each time and substitute the updated modification for
the previous modification.

*Cypher Pod.* The power armor provides an insulated pod in which you can
carry one additional manifest cypher beyond what your cypher limit
normally allows. Enabler.

*Drone (3 Intellect points).* A level 4 drone no larger than 1 foot (30
cm) on a side launches from your armor for one hour, flying up to a long
distance each round. The drone accompanies you and follows your
instructions. It has manipulators, allowing it to attempt to accomplish
physical tasks. You’ll probably make rolls for your drone when it takes
actions. A drone in combat usually doesn’t make separate attacks but
helps with yours. On your action, if the drone is next to you, it serves
as an asset for one attack you make on your turn. If the drone is
destroyed, you must spend another 2 XP to rebuild it or choose another
Masterful Armor Modification. Action to initiate.

*Improved Field Reinforcement.* You gain +1 to Armor while wearing your
power armor. Enabler.

*Jet-Assisted Flight (3+ Might points).* You modify your power armor to
allow you to blast off the ground and fly for one minute at a time. For
each level of Effort applied, you can increase the duration by an
additional minute. Action.

Mastery in Armor: The cost reduction from your Practiced in Armor
ability improves. You now reduce the Speed Effort cost for wearing armor
to 0. Enabler.

Mastery With Attacks: Choose one type of attack in which you are
trained: light bashing, light bladed, light ranged, medium bashing,
medium bladed, medium ranged, heavy bashing, heavy bladed, or heavy
ranged. You are specialized in attacks using that type of weapon.
Enabler. (If you aren’t trained in an attack, select Skill With Attacks
to become trained in that attack.)

Mastery With Defense: Choose one type of defense task in which you are
trained: Might, Speed, or Intellect. You are specialized in defense
tasks of that type. You can select this ability up to three times. Each
time you select it, you must choose a different type of defense task.
Enabler.

Matter Cloud (5 Intellect points): Pebbles, dirt, sand, and debris rise
into the air around you to form a swirling cloud. The cloud extends out
to immediate range, moves with you, and lasts for one minute. When it
ends, all the materials fall to the ground around you. The cloud makes
it harder for other creatures to attack you, giving you an asset on
Speed defense rolls. In addition, while the cloud is around you, you can
use an action to whip the material so that it abrades everything within
immediate range, dealing 1 point of damage to each creature and object
in the area. Action to initiate.

Maximize Cypher: Choose one subtle cypher you bear. Its level becomes
the maximum level possible for that cypher. For example, a meditation
aid has a level range of 1d6 + 2, so maximizing that cypher changes its
level to 8. You can have only one maximized subtle cypher at a time. You
can’t use this ability again until after you’ve taken a ten-hour
recovery action. Enabler.

Mechanical Telepathy (3 Intellect points): By touching a thinking
machine, you gain access to its surface “thoughts.” Action.

Medium Teleportation (5+ Intellect points): You instantly teleport
yourself to any location within a long distance that you can see. In
addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use
Effort to increase your range, teleport to a location you can’t see, or
bring other people with you. Each additional long distance costs one
level of Effort. Teleporting to

a destination you can’t see costs one level of Effort. Each additional
one or two targets brought with you costs one level of Effort (you must
touch any additional targets). These levels of Effort are counted
separately, so teleporting an additional long distance away to a
location you can’t see with two passengers costs a total of three levels
of Effort. Action.

If you already have Short Teleportation when you select Medium
Teleportation or Teleportation, you may replace Short Teleportation with
another tier 4 type ability.

Memory Becomes Action (4+ Intellect points): You can duplicate a
one-action character ability, performing it as if it were natural for
you. You must have seen the ability used within the past week, it must
be third tier or lower, and it must be an ability with a point cost. In
addition to the point cost of Memory Becomes Action, you must pay the
Might, Speed, or Intellect cost of the ability you are copying. For
example, if you want to copy a friend’s Lunge attack (which normally
costs 2 Might points), you’d pay 4 Intellect points to activate Memory
Becomes Action and 2 Might points to use Lunge. In addition to the
normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to copy an
ability you saw longer than one week ago; each level of Effort used in
this way extends the time period by one week.

Enabler.

Mental Link (1+ Intellect point): You open a pathway to another
creature’s mind via a light touch, which allows you to transmit thoughts
and images to each other. The mental link remains regardless of distance
and lasts for one hour. In addition to the normal options for using
Effort, you can choose to use Effort to extend the duration by one hour
for each level of Effort applied. Action to initiate.

Mental Projection (6+ Intellect points): Your mind fully leaves your
body and manifests anywhere you choose within immediate range. Your
projected mind can remain apart from your body for up to 24 hours. This
effect ends early if your Intellect Pool is reduced to 0 or if your
projection touches your resting body.

Your disembodied mind is a psychic construct that looks like you, though
its frayed edges trail off into nothingness. You control this body as if
it were your normal body and can act and move as you normally would with
a few exceptions. You can move through solid objects as if you were
phased, and you ignore any terrain feature that would impede your
movement.

Your attacks inflict 3 fewer points of damage (to a minimum of 1) and
you take 3 fewer points of damage (to a minimum of 1) from physical
attacks, unless they can affect transdimensional or phased beings, in
which case you take full damage. Regardless of the source, you take all
damage as Intellect damage first.

Your mind can travel up to 1 mile (1.5 km) from your body. Each level of
additional Effort applied extends the range that you can travel by 1
mile (1.5 km).

Your physical body is helpless until this effect ends. You cannot use
your physical senses to perceive anything. For example, your body could
sustain a significant injury, and you wouldn’t know it. Your body cannot
take Intellect damage, so if your body takes enough damage to reduce
both your Might Pool and your Speed Pool to 0, your mind snaps back to
your body, and you are stunned until the end of the next round as you
try to reorient yourself to your predicament. Action to initiate.

(Mentally projecting characters may attract psychic entities and
predators that PCs normally don’t have to deal with, run into weather
psychic phenomena that risks severing their connection, and possibly
even become lost on a different metaphysical plane.)

Mentally Tough: Staring into the naked weave of hyperspace, warped
space, or a similar effect related to faster-than-light travel is hard
on the mind, but you’ve developed resistance. You’re trained in
Intellect defense tasks. Enabler.

Meticulous Planner: If you spend a long time planning an action, you
gain an asset on performing it. The time to study and plan for the
action is ten times as long as it takes to perform the action. For
example, if you want to jump across a hole in the floor (one action),
you can study the area for ten rounds (about a minute), and when you
attempt to jump over the hole, you have an asset on the jump. This
benefit applies to only one roll—if you want to perform the task again
with the benefit of an asset, you need to study and plan again. Enabler.

Microgravity Adept: You ignore all the ill effects of low gravity and no
gravity on movement; you are trained in low-gravity maneuvers and  
zero-gravity maneuvers. (You might still be subject to negative
biological effects of long-term exposure, if any.) Enabler.

Microgravity Avoidance: By taking advantage of microgravity conditions,
you gain an asset to Speed defense tasks while in zero-gravity or  
low-gravity conditions. Enabler.

Mind Control (6+ Intellect points): You control the actions of another
creature you touch. This effect lasts for one minute. The target must be
level 2 or lower. Once you have established control, you maintain mental
contact with the target and sense what it senses. You can allow it to
act freely or override its control on a  
case-by-case basis. In addition to the normal options for using Effort,
you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target
or increase the duration by one minute. Thus, to control the mind of a
level 5 target (three levels above the normal limit) or control a target
for four minutes (three minutes above the normal duration), you must
apply three levels of Effort. When the duration ends, the creature
doesn’t remember being controlled or anything it did while under your
command. Action to initiate.

Mind for Might: When performing a task that would normally require
spending points from your Intellect Pool, you can spend points from your
Might Pool instead, and vice versa. Enabler.

Mind Games (3 Intellect points): You use lies and trickery, mockery, and
perhaps even hateful, obscene language against a foe that can understand
you. If successful, the foe is stunned for one round and cannot act, and
it is dazed in the following round, during which time its tasks are
hindered. Action.

Mind of a Leader (6 Intellect points): When you develop a course of
action to deal with a future situation, you can ask the GM one very
general question about what is likely to happen if you carry out the
plan, and you will get a simple, brief answer. Action.

Mind Reading (2 Intellect points): You can read the surface thoughts of
a creature within short range, even if the target doesn’t want you to.
You must be able to see your target. Once you have established contact,
you can read the target’s thoughts for up to one minute. If you also
have the Mind Reading special ability from another source, you can use
this ability at long range, and you don’t need to be able to see the
target (but you do have to know that the target is within range). Action
to initiate.

Mind Surge: In addition to your normal recovery rolls each day, you
can—at any time between ten-hour rests—recover 1d6 + 6 points to your
Intellect Pool. Action.

Minor Illusion (1 Intellect point): You create a single image of a
creature or object within immediate range. The image must fit within a
10-foot (3 m)  
cube. The image can move (for example, you could make the illusion of a
person walk or attack), but it can’t leave the area defined by the cube.
The illusion includes sound but not smell. It lasts for ten minutes, but
if you want to change the original illusion significantly—such as making
a creature appear to be wounded—you must concentrate on it again (though
doing so doesn’t cost additional Intellect points). If you move beyond
immediate range of the cube, the illusion vanishes. Action to create;
action to modify.

Minor Wish: At your request, the magic ally from your Bound Magic
Creature ability can use its action to cast a minor spell on you.
Afterward, it must retreat to its bound object to rest for one hour. The
effects it can produce include the following. Action to initiate.

*Golden Anger.* A golden light touches your eyes. For the next several
minutes, if you attack a target, you inflict 2 additional points of
damage.

*Golden Ward.* You gain +1 to Armor for one hour from a translucent
sheen of golden light.

*Light of Truth.* Whenever you attempt to discern falsehood during the
next hour, the task is eased by two steps.

*Touch of Grace.* With the magic ally’s touch, you add 3 points to any
stat Pool. If you are not damaged, you add the points to your chosen
Pool’s maximum. They remain until you spend them, you lose them to
damage, or an hour passes.

Miraculous Health: When you would descend a step on the damage track,
you can attempt a Might task to resist, with a difficulty equal to the
level of the foe or effect that harmed you. If successful, you don’t
descend the step and you regain 1 point in any Pool that is bereft of
points. You can’t use this ability again until after your next ten-hour
rest. Enabler.

Misdirect (3 Speed points): When an opponent misses you, you can
redirect their attack to another target (a creature or object) of your
choosing that’s within immediate range of you. Make an unmodified attack
roll against the new target (do not use any of your or the opponent’s
modifiers to the attack roll, but you can apply Effort for accuracy). If
the attack hits, the target takes damage from your opponent’s attack.
Enabler.

Misdirect Blame (2+ Intellect points): Using your clever words and
knowledge of others, you can attempt to alter the narrative so that a
target of up to level 3 within short range becomes uncertain of its
conviction in one simple area, such as their conviction that you just
stole a fruit from their stand or their belief that they’ve never met
you before. This effect usually lasts only for the period of time you
spend speaking, and perhaps up to a minute longer, before the target
realizes its error. In addition to the normal options for using Effort,
you can choose to use Effort to increase the target level that can be
affected. Afterward, all your tasks to persuade or otherwise socially
interact with the target are hindered. Action.

Mist Cloud (1+ Intellect points): You create an area of mist an
immediate distance across. The cloud lingers for about a minute unless
conditions (such as wind or freezing temperatures) dictate otherwise. In
addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use
Effort to increase the area (one level of Effort to fill a short area,
two to fill a long area, or three to fill a very long area). Action.

Mobile Fighter (3 Speed points): As part of your attack, you can leap on
or over obstacles, swing from ropes, run along narrow surfaces, or
otherwise move around the battlefield at your normal speed as if such
tasks were routine (difficulty 0). You can’t use this ability if your
Speed Effort costs are reduced from wearing armor. Enabler.

Moderate Wish: At your request, the magic ally from your Bound Magic
Creature ability can spend its action casting a moderate spell on you.
Afterward, it must retreat to its bound object to rest for at least one
hour. The effects it can produce include the following. Action to
initiate.

*Golden Armor.* You gain +3 to Armor for one hour from a translucent
sheen of golden light.

*Golden Fury.* A golden light blazes in your eyes. For the next three
minutes, if you attack a target, you inflict 5 additional points of
damage.

*Improved Touch of Grace.* With the magic ally’s touch, you add 6 points
to any stat Pool. If you are not damaged, you add the points to your
chosen Pool’s maximum. They remain until you spend them, you lose them
to damage, or an hour passes.

*Invisible.* With a touch, the magic ally bends light that falls on you,
so you seem to disappear. You are invisible to other creatures for ten
minutes. While invisible, you are specialized in stealth and Speed
defense tasks. This effect ends if you do something to reveal your
presence or position—attacking, using an ability, moving a large object,
and so on. If this occurs, you can regain the remaining invisibility
effect by taking an action to focus on hiding your position. Action to
initiate.

Modify Artifact Power (6 Intellect points): You permanently add +1 to
the level of an artifact of up to level 5. The difficulty of this task
is equal to the modified higher level of the artifact. If the task is
failed, the artifact makes a depletion roll and is not advanced in
level. Once modified, the artifact can’t be similarly boosted again.
Action.

Modify Cyphers: You can take any two manifest cyphers and quickly
jury-rig a new manifest cypher of the same level as the lowest-level
cypher. You determine the function of the new cypher, but it must be
that of a cypher you have used before (but not necessarily one you’ve
ever built). The new cypher is a temperamental cypher, like those
created with Always Tinkering. The original two cyphers are consumed in
this process. This ability does not function if one or more of the
original cyphers are temperamental cyphers. Action.

Modify Device (4 Intellect points): You jury-rig a piece of mechanical
or electrical equipment to make it function above its rated specs for a
very limited time. To do so, you must use spare parts equal to an
expensive item, have a field science kit (or a permanent lab, if you
have access to one), and succeed at a difficulty 3 Intellect-based task.
When complete, using the device eases all tasks performed in conjunction
with the device, until the device inevitably breaks. For example, you
could overclock a computer so research tasks using it are easier, modify
an espresso maker so that each cup of coffee made with it is better,
modify a car’s engine so that it goes faster (or modify its steering so
it handles better), and so on. Each use of the modified device requires
a depletion roll of 1–5 on a d20. Action to initiate, one hour to
complete.

Momentum: If you use an action to move, your next attack made using a
melee weapon before the end of the next round inflicts 2 additional
points of damage. Enabler.

Monster Bane: You inflict 1 additional point of damage with weapons.
When you inflict damage to creatures more than twice as large or massive
as you, you inflict 3 additional points of damage. Enabler.

Monster Lore: You are trained in the names, habits, suspected lairs, and
related topics regarding the monsters of your world. You can make
yourself understood in their languages (if they have one). Enabler.

Moon Shape (4+ Intellect points): You change into a monstrous natural
beast, such as a wolf, bear, or other terrestrial creature, for up to
one hour. If you try to change during daylight hours when you are not
deep underground (or otherwise away from the daylight), you must apply a
level of Effort. In your new form, you add 8 points to your Might Pool,
gain +2 to your Might Edge, add 2 points to your Speed Pool, and gain +2
to your Speed Edge. Reverting to your normal form is a difficulty 2
task. While in beast form, you are prone to fits of rage (triggered by
GM intrusion), during which you attack every living creature within
short range, and the only way to end the rage is to revert to your
normal form. Either way, after you revert to your normal form, you take
a –1 penalty to all rolls for one hour. If you did not kill and eat at
least one substantial creature while in beast form, the penalty
increases to –2 and affects all your rolls for the next day. Action to
change; action to revert.

Mount: A level 3 creature serves you as a mount and follows your
instructions. While you’re mounted on it, the creature can move and you
can attack on your turn, which provides an asset to your attack. You and
the GM must work out the details of the creature, and you’ll probably
make rolls for it when it takes noncombat actions. The mount acts on
your turn. If your mount dies, you can hunt in the wild for 3d6 days to
find a new one. Enabler.

Move Metal (1 Intellect point): You can exert force on metal objects
within short range for one round. Once activated, your power has an
effective Might Pool of 10, a Might Edge of 1, and an Effort of 2
(approximately equal to the strength of a fit, capable, adult human),
and you can use it to move metal objects, push against metal objects,
and so on. For example, in your round, you could lift and pull a light
metal object anywhere within range to yourself or move a heavy object
(like a piece of furniture) about 10 feet (3 m). This power lacks the
fine control to wield a weapon or move objects with much speed, so in
most situations, it’s not a means of attack. You can’t use this ability
on your own body. The power lasts for one hour or until its Might Pool
is depleted, whichever comes first. Action.

Move Mountains (9 Intellect points): You exert a tremendous amount of
physical force within 250 feet (75 m) of you. You can push up to 10 tons
(9 t) of material up to 50 feet (15 m). This force can collapse
buildings, redirect small rivers, or perform other dramatic effects.
Action.

Movement Skills: You are trained in climbing and jumping. Enabler.

Moving Like Water (3 Speed points): You spin and move so that your
defense and attacks are aided by your fluid motion. For one minute, all
your attacks and Speed defense tasks gain an asset. Enabler.

Multiple Copying: When you use Copy Power, you can copy two of the
creature’s abilities at the same time. In addition to the normal options
for using Effort with Copy Power, you can apply levels of Effort to copy
additional abilities, each level of Effort copying an additional ability
beyond the initial two (three for one level of Effort, four for two
levels, and so on). Enabler.

Multiple Quarry (6 Intellect points): This ability functions like the
Quarry ability except that you can select up to three creatures as
quarry. You must be able to see all three creatures when you initiate
this ability. If you have Hunter’s Drive, it applies to all three
creatures. Action to initiate.

Multiple Skills: You are trained in three skills of your choice in which
you are not already trained. You can select this ability multiple times.
Each time you select it, you must choose three different skills.
Enabler.

Multiplicity (6 Might points): This ability functions as Duplicate,
except you can create two duplicates. Action to initiate.

Multi-Vanish (4+ Intellect points): You turn up to five human-sized
creatures or objects invisible for a short amount of time. The targets
you choose must be within an immediate area and within short range of
you (if you are in the area, you can make yourself invisible and don’t
count toward the limit of five invisible targets). Anything invisible
has an asset on stealth and Speed defense tasks. Affected creatures can
see each other in a limited way, and you can see them clearly.

The invisibility ends at the end of your next turn. If one of the
affected creatures does something to reveal their presence or
position—attacking, using an ability, moving a large object, and so
on—the invisibility ends early for that creature. In addition to the
normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to
increase the duration; each level of Effort used in this way increases
the duration by one round (but creatures can still end it early for
themselves). Action.

Murderer (8+ Speed points): With a swift and sudden attack, you strike a
foe in a vital spot. If the target is level 4 or lower, it is killed
outright. For each additional level of Effort you apply, you can
increase the level of the target by 1. Action.

Muscles of Iron (2 Might points): For the next ten minutes, all
Might-based actions other than attack rolls that you attempt are eased.
If you already have this ability from another source, the effect of this
ability lasts for one hour instead of ten minutes. Enabler.

Abilities—N

Natural Charisma: You are trained in all social interactions, whether
they involve charm, learning a person’s secrets, or intimidating others.
Enabler.

Natural Crafter: All commonplace objects or structures you craft are
effectively one level higher than an average example of that object or
structure. For instance, if you craft a defensive wall that would
normally be level 4, its effective level is 5. Enabler.

Necromancy (3+ Intellect points): You animate the body of a dead
creature of approximately your size or smaller, creating a level 1
creature. It has none of the intelligence, memories, or special
abilities that it had in life. The creature follows your verbal commands
for one hour, after which it becomes an inert corpse. Unless the
creature is killed by damage, you can reanimate it again when its time
expires, but any damage it had when it became inert applies to its newly
reanimated state. If you have access to multiple bodies, you can create
an additional undead creature for each additional Intellect point you
spend when you activate the ability. Action to animate.

Negate Danger (7 Intellect points): You permanently negate a source of
potential danger related to one creature or object within immediate
distance. This could be a weapon or device held by someone, a creature’s
natural ability, or a trap triggered by a pressure plate. Action.

Negotiate (3 Intellect points): In any gathering where two or more
people are trying to establish the truth or come to a decision, you can
sway the verdict with masterful rhetoric. If you are given a few rounds
or more to argue your point, either the decision goes your way or, if
someone else effectively argues a competing point, any associated
persuasion or deception task is eased by two steps. Action to initiate,
one or more rounds to complete.

Network Tap (4 Intellect points): You can ask the GM one question and
get a very short answer if you succeed on an Intellect roll against a
difficulty assigned by the GM. The more obscure the answer, the more
difficult the task. On a failed roll, feedback or perhaps some defense
from the network you’re accessing inflicts 4 points of Intellect damage
on you (ignores Armor). Action. (Generally, knowledge that you could
find by looking somewhere other than your current location is level 1,
while obscure knowledge of the past is level 7. Gaining knowledge of the
future is impossible.)

Never Fumble: If you roll a natural 1 when attacking with your chosen
weapon, you can ignore or countermand the GM intrusion for that roll.
You can never be disarmed of your chosen weapon, nor will you ever drop
it accidentally. Enabler.

Nightmare (5 Intellect points): You pull a horrifying creature from your
worst nightmare into the waking world and sic it on your foes. The
nightmare (level 5) persists each round while you use your action
concentrating on it (or until you disperse it or it is destroyed). It
has one of the following abilities, which you choose when you call it.

*Confusion.* Instead of making a normal attack, the nightmare’s attack
confuses the target for one round. On its next action, the target
attacks an ally.

*Horrify.* Instead of making a normal attack, the nightmare’s attack
horrifies the target, which drops to its knees (or similar appendages).
The target takes 3 points of damage that ignore Armor and is dazed for
one round, during which time all its tasks are hindered.

*Pustule Eruption.* Instead of making a normal attack, the nightmare’s
attack causes rancid, painful pustules to rise all over the target’s
skin for one minute. If the target takes a forceful action (such as
attacking another creature or moving farther than an immediate
distance), the pustules burst, dealing 5 points of damage that ignore
Armor.

Action to initiate, action each round to concentrate.

Nightstrike: When you attack a foe in dim light or darkness, you get a
free level of Effort on the attack. Enabler.

Nimble Swimmer: You are trained in all defense actions while underwater.
Enabler.

No Need for Weapons: When you make an unarmed attack (such as a punch or
kick), it counts as a medium weapon instead of a light weapon. Enabler.

No One Knows Better: You are trained in two of the following skills:
persuasion, deception, intimidation, research, knowledge in one area, or
seeing through deception. If you choose a skill in which you’re already
trained, you become specialized in that skill instead. Enabler.

Noble’s Courage (3+ Intellect points): Your noble lineage teaches that
courage is necessary to do things that are difficult, tedious, or
dangerous. When your mind would be negatively affected by an effect of
up to level 4, whether something as overt as a psychic command or
illness or something as subtle as fear or even boredom, your courage
neutralizes the effect for up to a minute or, if you’re actively being
attacked, until the next attack. For each level of Effort applied, you
can increase the level of the effect you can neutralize by 1. Enabler.

Not Dead Yet: When you would normally be dead, you instead fall
unconscious for one round and then awaken. You immediately gain 1d6 + 6
points to restore your stat Pools, and you are treated as if debilitated
until you rest for ten hours. If you die again before you make your
ten-hour recovery roll, you are truly dead. If you also have this
ability from another source, your healing from this ability increases to
1d6 + 12. Enabler.

Nothing but Defend: If you do nothing on your turn but defend, you are
specialized in all defense tasks for one round. Action.

Nullify Sound (3 Might points): You pulse perfectly misaligned sounds
within short range to create a zone of absolute quiet up to an immediate
distance across for one minute. All sound is canceled in the zone.
Action to initiate.

Abilities—O

Object Bond (3 Intellect points): When you manifest the magic ally from
your Bound Magic Creature ability, it can move up to 300 feet (90 m)
from you before being returned to its bound object. Also, it can remain
manifest for an extended period, lasting until the end of your next
ten-hour recovery roll. Finally, if you give permission, the magic ally
can emerge from and enter the bound object on its own initiative.
Enabler.

Object Bond Mastery (7 Intellect points): When you manifest the magic
ally from your Bound Magic Creature ability, it is now a level 7
creature. It can remain manifest for only three minutes, after which it
must return to its object and rest for three days before you can
manifest it again.

The magic ally can make its own magic touch attacks (when it does, you
roll for it). If it uses its pulse attack from Improved Object Bond,
instead of deactivating items, it can take control of one item within
short range for one minute, if applicable.

Finally, the magic ally can transform into smoke and flame as its
action, giving it +10 to Armor but rendering it incapable of attacking
foes. In this form, it can fly a long distance each round, and the first
time each day it returns to flesh (as an action), it regains 25 points
of health.

Enabler.

Obstacle Running (3 Speed points): For the next minute, you can ignore
obstacles that slow your movement, allowing you to travel at normal
speed through areas with rubble, fences, tables, and similar objects
that you would have to climb over or move around. This movement might
include sliding on a railing, briefly running along a wall, or even
stepping on a creature to boost yourself over something. If an obstacle
would normally require a Might or Speed task to overcome, such as
swinging on a rope, balancing on a rope, or jumping over a hole, you are
trained in that task. Enabler.

One With the Wild (6 Intellect points): For the next hour, natural
animals and plants within long range will not knowingly harm you or
those you designate. In addition, your Might Edge, Speed Edge, and
Intellect Edge increase by 1, and if you make any recovery rolls during
this period, you recover twice as many points. Action to initiate.

Oneirochemy: You are trained in tasks related to sleep and mixing
natural elixirs to help creatures fall asleep. Enabler.

Onslaught (1 Intellect point): You attack a foe using energies that
assail either their physical form or their mind. In either case, you
must be able to see your target. If the attack is physical, you emit a
short-range ray of force that inflicts 4 points of damage. If the attack
is mental, you focus your mental energy to blast the thought processes
of another creature within short range. This mindslice inflicts 2 points
of Intellect damage (ignores Armor). Some creatures without minds (such
as robots) might be immune to your mindslice. Action.

Open Mind (3 Intellect points): You open your mind to increase your
awareness. You gain an asset to any task involving perception. While you
have this asset and you are conscious and able to take actions, other
characters gain no benefit from surprising you. The effect lasts for one
hour. Action.

Opening Statement: You’re trained in tasks related to persuasion,
deception, and detecting the falsehoods of others. Enabler.

Opportunist: You have an asset on any attack roll you make against a
creature that has already been attacked at some point during the round
and is within immediate range. Enabler.

Oratory (4 Intellect points): When speaking with a group of intelligent
creatures that can understand you and aren’t hostile, you convince them
to take one reasonable action in the next round. A reasonable action
should not put the creatures or their allies in obvious danger or be
wildly out of character. Action.

Out of Harm’s Way: No matter how careful, an investigator sometimes ends
up in a scrap. Knowing how to survive is more than half the battle. You
are trained in Speed defense tasks. Enabler.

Outlast the Foe: If you have been in combat for five full rounds, you
have an asset for all tasks in the remainder of the combat, and you deal
1 additional point of damage per attack. Enabler.

Outlaw Reputation (3 Intellect points): People know of your notorious
exploits, which have been told and retold so many times that they bear
little resemblance to reality. But people fear your name when they
recognize you (or you declare yourself). They become so afraid that all
attacks made against you by affected targets within earshot are hindered
until one or more of them successfully inflicts damage on you or one of
your allies, at which time their fear abates. Enabler.

Outside Reality (6+ Intellect points): You exist outside of everything
until the start of your next turn. To you, a few seconds pass while you
are alone in a cool void. To everyone else, you seem to vanish for a few
seconds and reappear in the same place. While in this unreal state, you
can use abilities or objects on yourself, but you can’t perceive,
interact with, or affect the rest of the world, and vice versa.
Time-based effects already on you (like a poison that inflicts damage
every round) are paused while you exist outside reality, but when this
ability ends they resume as if no time had passed. In addition to the
normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to
increase the duration; each level of Effort used in this way adds one
round to how long you spend outside reality. Enabler.

Outwit: When you make a Speed defense roll, you can use your Intellect
in place of your Speed. Enabler.

Overawe (5 Intellect points): A blast of divine radiance from the
heavens spotlights a target you select within long range, pushing the
target to its knees (or similar appendages, if any) and rendering it
helpless in the light for up to ten minutes, or until it breaks free.
The overawed target cannot defend itself, make attacks, or attempt
anything other than to shake free of the divine awe each round. If the
target is a demon, spirit, or something similar, it also takes 1 point
of damage that ignores Armor each round it remains affected. Action to
initiate.

Overcharge Device: You infuse 1 point of energy gained from using Absorb
Energy or related ability into a device, such as an artifact, raising
its effective level on its next use by three (to a maximum of 10).
Action.

Overcharge Energy: When you use Release Energy, it inflicts an
additional 2 points of damage. Enabler.

Overcome All Obstacles (3+ Intellect points): Those who stand against
you do so at their peril and eventually shrink away in your presence.
When you focus on a particular foe within long range, the target suffers
2 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) each round for one minute
or until the target can throw off the effect. This ability can only be
active on one target at a time. You can apply Effort to increase damage
during the first round, and for any one round in which you apply Effort
and use another action. Action to initiate.

Overload Machine (3+ Intellect points): Through the robot assistant from
your Serv-0 ability, you infuse a powered device of level 3 or lower
with more energy than it can handle. If affected, the device is
destroyed or disabled for at least one minute, depending on its size and
complexity. The GM may rule that the disabling effect lasts until the
device is repaired. In addition to the normal options for using Effort,
you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the
target. Thus, to overload a level 5 device (two levels above the normal
limit), you must apply two levels of Effort. Action.

Overwatch (1 Intellect point): You use a ranged weapon to target a
limited area (such as a doorway, a hallway, or the eastern side of the
clearing) and make an attack against the next viable target to enter
that area. This works like a wait action, but you also negate any
benefit the target would have from cover, position, surprise, range,
illumination, or visibility. Further, you inflict 1 additional point of
damage with the attack. You can remain on overwatch as long as you wish,
within reason. Action.

Abilities—P

Parry (5 Speed points): You can deflect incoming attacks quickly. When
you activate this ability, for the next ten rounds you ease all Speed
defense rolls. Enabler.

Passing Mechanic: You are trained in tasks related to the repair and
maintenance of a starcraft. Enabler.

Patient Recovery: You gain an extra ten-minute recovery roll each day.
Enabler.

Pay It Forward (3 Intellect points): You can pass on what you’ve
learned. When you give another character a suggestion involving their
next action that is not an attack, their action is eased for one minute.
Action.

Perfect Control: You no longer need to make a roll to use Beast Form or
change into your normal form. You can change back and forth as your
action. When you return to your normal form, you no longer take a
penalty to your rolls. Enabler.

Perfect Speed Burst (6 Speed points): You can take two separate actions
this round. Enabler.

Perfect Stranger (3 Intellect points): You alter your posture and way of
speaking and make a small but real alteration to an outfit (such as
putting on or taking off a hat, reversing a cloak, and so on). For the
next hour (or as long as you keep up the alteration), even creatures
that know you well don’t recognize you. All tasks related to hiding your
true identity during this period gain one free level of Effort. Action
to initiate.

Perks of Stardom: You are adept at claiming the rewards that fame can
generate. When you are recognized, you can be seated at any restaurant,
be let into any government building, be invited to any show or sports
event (even if they’re sold out), get a seat at a private function of
any sort, or get into any club, no matter how exclusive. When dealing
with someone who can’t or won’t immediately give in to your desire, you
gain an asset on all tasks related to persuasion if that person
recognizes you or is convinced that you’re a celebrity even if they
don’t recognize you. Enabler.

Permanent Illusion (9 Intellect points): An illusion (or portion of an
illusion) that you create using Minor Illusion or related ability that
fits within a 10-foot (3 m) cube becomes permanent.You can permanently
end the illusion as an action, but others must expend exceptional
ingenuity to prevent the illusion from regenerating even if it has
apparently been dispersed. Enabler.

Phase Detonation (2+ Might points): When you use Phase Sprint or Walk
Through Walls, you can choose to significantly damage normal matter
around you with a blast of transdimensional energy when you first go
into or come out of phase (your choice). This detonation inflicts 4
points of damage that ignores Armor to all creatures and objects within
immediate range. If you apply Effort to increase the damage rather than
ease the task, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level of
Effort (instead of 3 points); targets in the area take 1 point of damage
even if you fail the attack roll. Enabler.

Phase Door (4 Intellect points): You can phase into a solid object’s
surface and then phase out of any other solid object within long range
of the first, even if the two objects are not connected. There must be
no intervening barriers between the two objects, and you must be aware
of or able to see the destination object. Action.

Phase Foe (6+ Intellect points): You gather disrupting energy in your
fingertip and touch a creature. If the target is an NPC or a creature of
level 3 or lower, it becomes phased as if it had used the Ghost ability.
However, unless it can figure out how to control its movement while
being phased, which most creatures have no experience with, it begins to
sink through solid matter. If it can’t control itself or end the effect,
it might be gone for good because when it becomes solid again after ten
minutes, it’s probably deep in the earth. For each additional level of
Effort you apply, you can attempt to affect a target of one level
higher. Action.

Phase Sprint (1+ Speed points): You can run up to a long distance as
long as you take no other actions. During your action and until the
beginning of your next turn, you are partially phased, and some attacks
pass through you harmlessly. While phased, you gain an asset to your
Speed defense tasks, but you lose any benefit from armor you wear.

Note that some of your other special abilities may enable specific
actions that you can take while using Phase Sprint. For instance, when
using Disrupting Touch, you can make one touch attack while moving
(though this ends your movement). Action. (You don’t have to run in one
long, straight line when using Phase Sprint, but can instead zig and
zag, curve, or even return to where you started.) (Other abilities can
be used with Phase Sprint to unlock additional effects, including
Disrupting Touch, Scratch Existence, Invisible Phasing, and Phase
Detonation. These abilities are additive enablers, requiring the user to
spend points for both abilities, and sometimes from two different
Pools.)

Phased Attack (3 Intellect points): The attack you make on this turn
ignores your foe’s armor. The ability works for whatever kind of attack
you use (melee, ranged, energy, and so on). Enabler.

Phased Pocket (2+ Intellect points): You connect yourself for one hour
to a small space that is out of phase and moves with you. You can access
this space as if it were a convenient pocket or bag, but nobody else can
perceive or access the space unless they have the ability to interact
with transdimensional areas. The space can hold up to 1 cubic foot. The
space is a part of you, so you can’t use it to carry more cyphers than
your limit, a detonation cypher activated inside the space harms you,
and so on. When the connection ends, anything in the space falls out.
For each 2 additional Intellect points you spend, the pocket lasts an
additional hour. Enabler.

Physical Skills: You are trained in two skills in which you are not
already trained. Choose two of the following: balancing, climbing,
jumping, running, or swimming. You can select this ability multiple
times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills.
Enabler.

Physically Gifted: Any time you spend points from your Might Pool or
Speed Pool on an action for any reason, if you roll a 1 on the
associated die, you reroll, always taking the second result (even if
it’s another 1). Enabler.

Pierce (1 Speed point): This is a well-aimed, penetrating ranged attack.
You make an attack and inflict 1 additional point of damage if your
weapon has a sharp point. Action.

Pilot: You are trained in all tasks related to piloting a starcraft.
Generally speaking, piloting tasks are Speed-based tasks, though using
sensors and communication instruments are Intellect-based tasks.
Enabler.

Play to the Crowd (3 Intellect points): You give a speech that is both
rousing and terrifying. Those within short range who can hear and
understand you have their next action either eased (an asset) or
hindered—you choose, and it can be different for each individual.
Action; a few rounds to complete.

Poetic License: You are trained in all social interactions, including
persuasion, deception, and intimidation. You also know two additional
languages. Enabler.

Poison Crafter: You are trained in crafting, sensing, identifying, and
resisting poisons. Your poison crafting has given you some immunity to
poisons; you have +5 Armor that applies specifically to poison damage.
Enabler.

Poison Resistance: Thanks to an injection of biological agents, a quaff
of a magical elixir, a ring from a dying alien, or something just as
extreme, you are now immune to poisons, toxins, or any kind of
particulate threat. You are not immune to viruses, bacteria, or
radiation. Enabler.

Post-Apocalyptic Survivor: You are trained in stealth and Might defense
tasks. Enabler.

Power Strike (3+ Might points): If you successfully attack a target, you
knock it prone in addition to inflicting damage. The target must be your
size or smaller. You can knock down a target larger than you if you
apply a level of Effort to do so (rather than to ease the attack).
Enabler.

Power Crash (3 Intellect points): You strike your enchanted weapon
against the ground (or a similar large surface), creating an explosion
of energy that affects an area up to immediate range from that point.
(If your enchanted weapon is a ranged weapon, you can instead target a
point within close range to be the center of the explosion.) The blast
inflicts 2 points of damage to all creatures or objects within the area
(except for you). Because this is an area attack, adding Effort to
increase your damage works differently than it does for single-target
attacks. If you apply a level of Effort to increase the damage, add 2
points of damage for each target, and even if you fail your attack roll,
all targets in the area still take 1 point of damage. Action.

Power Memory: When you use Copy Power, you only need to have seen the
ability used within the past day (instead of the past hour), and using
Effort extends how long ago your copying can reach to one day per level
of Effort (instead of one hour per level). Enabler.

Powered Armor: You have a suit of powered armor. It is effectively
medium armor (+2 to Armor); however, you suffer no Speed penalties for
wearing it. Also, your suit grants other benefits: it provides
breathable air for up to eight hours and a comfortable environment even
in bitter heat, cold, vacuum, or underwater to a depth of 4 miles (6
km); and it allows you to see in the dark up to a short distance.
Getting into the suit requires an action (and, of course, access to your
suit). Enabler.

Powerful Rhetoric (1 Intellect point): After engaging a creature in
conversation for at least a minute, you can attempt to influence how
that creature is perceived, promoting it as a friend, dismissing it as a
fool, or denouncing it as an enemy. Your words are so well chosen that
even you and it are affected, because your conviction and its doubt are
paramount. The accuracy of your assessment isn’t important as long as
you keep up the rhetoric. From then on (or until you change your
rhetoric or the creature offers a convincing defense to those who’ve
heard your label), the friend’s social interactions gain an asset, the
fool’s social interactions are hindered, or the enemy’s defenses are
hindered. Action to initiate, one minute to complete.

Practiced in Armor: You can wear armor for long periods of time without
tiring and can compensate for slowed reactions from wearing armor. You
reduce the Speed cost for wearing armor by 1. You start the game with a
type of armor of your choice. Enabler.

Practiced With All Weapons: You become practiced with light, medium, and
heavy weapons and suffer no penalty when using any kind of weapon.
Enabler.

Practiced With Guns: You are practiced with guns and suffer no penalty
when using one. Enabler.

Practiced With Medium Weapons: You can use light and medium weapons
without penalty. If you wield a heavy weapon, attacks with it are
hindered. Enabler.

Practiced With Swords: You are practiced with swords and can use them
without penalty. Enabler.

Precise Cut: You inflict 1 additional point of damage with light
weapons. Enabler.

Precision: You deal 2 additional points of damage with attacks using
weapons that you throw. Enabler.

Precognition (6 Intellect points): You dimly sense the future for the
next ten minutes. This has the following effects until the duration
expires:

Your defense tasks gain an asset.

You can predict the actions of those around you. You gain an asset to
seeing through deceptions and attempts to betray you as well as avoiding
traps and ambushes.

You know what people are probably thinking and what they will say before
they say it, which gives you an edge. You gain an asset to all
interaction skills.

Enabler.

Predictive Equation (2 Intellect points): You observe or study a
creature, object, or location for at least one round. The next time you
interact with it (possibly in the following round), a related task (such
as persuading the creature, attacking it, or defending from its attack)
is eased. Action.

Predictive Model (2+ Intellect points): If you’ve used Predictive
Equation on a creature, object, or location within the last few days,
you can learn one random fact about the subject that is pertinent to a
topic you designate. If you also have the magic flavor ability
Premonition, one use of either ability grants you two random but related
facts about the subject. In addition, you can use Predictive Model on
the same subject multiple times (even if you’ve learned a creature’s
level), but each time you do, you must apply one additional level of
Effort than on your previous use. Action.

Premonition (2 Intellect points): You learn one random fact about a
creature or location that is pertinent to a topic you designate.
Alternatively, you can choose to learn a creature’s level; however, if
you do so, you cannot learn anything else about it later with this
ability. Action.

Preternatural Senses: While you are conscious and able to use an action,
you cannot be surprised. In addition, you are trained in initiative
actions. Enabler.

Privileged Nobility: You are adept at claiming the rewards that a noble
background can generate. When recognized, you can be seated at any
eating establishment no matter how full, get a room in an inn even if
that means others are turned out, be let into any court or other
structure where laws are decided or nobility rules, be invited to any
gala, and get a seat at a private function of any sort. In addition, you
are trained in persuasion. Enabler.

Projection (4 Intellect points): You project an image of yourself to any
location you have seen or previously visited. Distance does not matter
as long as the location is on the same world as you. The projection
copies your appearance, movements, and any sounds you make for the next
ten minutes. Anyone present at the location can see and hear you as if
you were there. However, you do not perceive through your projection.
Action to initiate.

Protective Wall (6+ Might points): When engaging in combat that directly
relates to defending a community you are associated with, you can attack
up to five different foes as a single action as long as they are all
within immediate range. If you hit an attacker, they are pushed back an
immediate distance. All of the attacks have to be the same sort of
attack (melee or ranged). Make a separate attack roll for each foe. You
remain limited by the amount of Effort you can apply on one action.
Anything that modifies your attack or damage applies to all of these
attacks. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can
choose to use Effort to increase the number of foes you can attack with
this ability, one additional foe per level of Effort. Enabler.

Protector: You designate a single character to be your charge. You can
change this freely every round, but you can have only one charge at a
time. As long as that charge is within immediate range, they gain an
asset for Speed defense tasks because you have their back. Enabler.

Pry Open (4 Intellect points): You tear apart the defenses of a creature
within long range. Any energy-based defenses it has (such as a force
field or a Ward ability) are negated for 1d6 + 1 rounds. If the creature
has no energy defenses, its Armor is reduced by 2 for one minute. If it
has no energy-based defenses or Armor, attacks against it are eased for
one minute. Action.

Psychic Burst (3+ Intellect points): You blast waves of mental force
into the minds of up to three targets within short range (make an
Intellect roll against each target). This burst inflicts 3 points of
Intellect damage (ignores Armor). For each 2 additional Intellect points
you spend, you can make an Intellect attack roll against an additional
target. Action.

Psychic Passenger (6 Intellect points): You place your mind into the
body of a willing creature you choose within short range and remain in
that body for up to one hour. Your own body falls down and becomes
insensate until this ability ends.

You see, hear, smell, touch, and taste using the senses of the creature
whose body you inhabit. When you speak, the words come from your
defenseless body, and the creature you inhabit hears those words in
their mind.

The creature you inhabit can use your Intellect Edge in place of their
own. In addition, you and the creature have an asset on any task that
involves perception.

When you take an action, you use the creature’s body to perform that
action if they allow it.

Action to initiate.

(A character should using Psychic Passenger should consider secreting
their actual body someplace away from prying eyes and wild beasts, or
they may return to an unfortunate situation.)

Psychic Suggestion (4 Intellect points): You attempt to make the target
take the action you indicate on its next turn. If the action you wish
the target to take would cause direct harm to itself or its allies, your
mental attack is hindered. Action.

Psychokinetic Attack (5 Intellect points): You can use this attack in
one of two ways. The first is to pick up a heavy object and hurl it at
someone within short range. This attack is an Intellect action, and if
successful, it deals 6 points of damage to the target and to the hurled
object (which could be another foe, although that would require two
rolls—one roll to grab the first foe and another roll to hit the second
foe with the first). The second way is to unleash a shattering burst of
power that works only against an inanimate object no larger than half
your size. Make an Intellect roll to instantly destroy the object; the
task is eased by three steps compared to breaking it with brute
strength. Action.

Psychosis (4 Intellect points): Your words inflict a destructive
psychosis in the mind of a target within long range that can understand
you, dealing 6 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) per round. The
psychosis can be dispersed if a target uses an action doing nothing but
calming and centering itself. Action to initiate.

Pull a Fast One (3 Intellect points): When you’re running a con, picking
a pocket, fooling or tricking a dupe, sneaking something by a guard, and
so on, you gain an asset on the task. Enabler.

Punish All the Guilty (3 Speed points): You can attack up to five foes
within immediate range that you have designated as guilty with your
Designation ability, all as part of the same action in one round. Make
separate attack rolls for each foe, but all attacks count as a single
action in a single round. You remain limited by the amount of Effort you
can apply on one action. Anything that modifies your attack or damage
applies to all attacks. If you also have the Spin Attack ability, you
inflict 1 additional point of damage when you use Punish All the Guilty.
Action.

Punish the Guilty (2 Might points): For the next ten minutes, if you
attack someone you have designated as guilty with your Designation
ability, you inflict 2 additional points of damage. Action to initiate.

Push (2 Intellect points): You telekinetically push a creature or object
an immediate distance in any direction you wish. You must be able to see
the target, which must be your size or smaller, must not be affixed to
anything, and must be within short range. The push is quick, and the
force is too crude to be manipulated. For example, you can’t use this
ability to pull a lever or close a door. Action.

Push Off and Throw (3 Speed points): You can make precise,
point-to-point jumps in microgravity, which means you can move up to a
long distance and make a melee attack or attempt to grab a foe of your
size or smaller. If you successfully grab your foe, you move your foe up
to a short distance from its original position.

Alternatively, while you come to a standstill (or move off in an
immediate distance per round in any direction you choose) you can launch
your foe in a chosen direction through space at a rate of a short
distance per round.

Action.

Push on Through (2 Might points): You ignore the effects of terrain
while moving for one hour. Enabler.

Abilities—Q

Quarry (2 Intellect points): Choose a quarry (a single individual
creature that you can see). You are trained in all tasks involving
following, understanding, interacting with, or fighting that creature.
You can have only one quarry at a time. Action to initiate.

Question the Spirits (2 Intellect points): You can call a spirit to you
and petition it to answer a few questions (usually no more than three
before the spirit fades).

First, you must summon a spirit. If it is a spirit of the dead, you must
have personally known the creature, have an object that was owned by  
the creature, or touch the physical remains  
of the creature. For other spirits, you must know the spirit’s full name
or have a great deal of an element (such as fire or earth) that the
spirit is associated with.

If the spirit responds, it can manifest as an insubstantial shade that
answers for itself, it can inhabit an object or any remains you provide,
or it can manifest as an invisible presence that you speak for.

The spirit may not wish to answer your questions, in which case you must
persuade it to help. You can attempt to psychically wrestle the spirit
into submission (an Intellect task), or you can try diplomacy,
deception, or blackmail (“Answer me, or I’ll tell your children that you
were a philanderer” or “I’ll destroy this relic that belonged to you”).

The GM determines what the spirit might know, based on the knowledge it
possessed in life.

Action to initiate.

Quick Block: If you use a light or medium weapon, you are trained in
Speed defense tasks. Enabler.

Quick Death (2 Speed points): You know how to kill quickly. When you hit
with a melee or ranged attack, you deal 4 additional points of damage.
You can’t make this attack in two consecutive rounds. Action.

Quick Recovery: Your second recovery roll (usually requiring ten
minutes) is only a single action. Enabler.

Quick Strike (4 Speed points): You make a melee attack with such speed
that it is hard for your foe to defend against, and it knocks them off
balance. Your attack is eased by two steps, and the foe, if struck,
takes normal damage but is dazed so that their tasks are hindered for
the next round. Action.

Quick Study: You learn from repetitive actions. You gain a +1 bonus to
rolls for similar tasks after the first time (such as operating the same
device or making attacks against the same foe). Once you move on to a
new task, the familiarity with the old task fades—unless you start doing
it again. Enabler.

Quick Switch: You can activate Shrink as part of another action (the
ability is now an enabler for you instead of an action). While the
one-minute duration of Shrink is active, on your turn you can change
size once before taking an action and once after taking an action. For
example, on your turn you could change to small size, make an attack,
and then return to your normal size, or you could change to your normal
size, use your action to move a short distance, and then return to small
size. Enabler.

Quick Throw (2 Speed points): After using a thrown light weapon, you
draw another light weapon and make another thrown attack against the
same target or a different one. Action.

Quick to Flee: You are trained in stealth and movement tasks. Enabler.

Quick Wits: When performing a task that would normally require spending
points from your Intellect Pool, you can spend points from your Speed
Pool instead. Enabler.

Quick Work (3+ Intellect points): One use of any artifact (or one minute
of its continuous function) is increased by one level if you use it
within the next minute. If you spend 4 additional Intellect points, the
use is increased by two levels if you use it within the next minute.
Action.

Quicker Than Most: Experience has honed your reaction times, because
those who act first gain the advantage in most situations. You’re
trained in tasks related to initiative, seeing underlying patterns, and
solving puzzles. Enabler.

Abilities—R

Rally to Me (2 Intellect points): You cry out, blow a battle horn, or
otherwise signal to everyone within very long range that you require
aid. All allied creatures who respond by moving to within an immediate
distance of you within the next few rounds gain one asset on any one
attack or defense task within the next hour that you suggest, such as
“Hold the gate,” “Charge that group of orcs,” or something similar.
Action to initiate.

Range Increase: Ranges for you increase by one step. Immediate becomes
short, short becomes long, long becomes very long, and very long becomes
1,000 feet (300 m). Enabler.

Rapid Attack (3 Speed points): Once per round, you can make an
additional attack with your chosen weapon. Enabler.

Rapid Processing (6 Intellect points): You or a target you touch
experiences a higher level of mental and physical reaction time for
about a minute. During that period, all Speed tasks (including Speed
defense rolls) are eased. In addition, the target can take one extra
action at any time before the ability’s duration expires. Action.

Rapid Recovery: You can make most recovery rolls faster than normal. You
can make your  
one-action recovery roll as part of another action or when it isn’t your
turn, your ten-minute recovery roll takes you only one action, and your
one-hour recovery roll takes you only ten minutes (your ten-hour rest is
unchanged). If you make a recovery roll when it isn’t your turn, until
the end of your next turn all of your tasks are hindered. Enabler.

Ray of Confusion (2 Intellect points): You project a grey beam of
confusion at a creature within short range, inflicting 1 point of damage
that ignores Armor. In addition, until the end of the next round, all
tasks, attacks, and defenses the target attempts are hindered. Action.

Reaction: If a creature you attacked on your last turn with a melee
attack uses its action to move out of immediate range, you gain an
action to attack the creature as a parting blow, even if you have
already taken a turn in the round. Enabler.

Reactive Field: Thanks to a remarkable enhancement of science, magic,
psionics, or something even stranger, you now have a force field that
radiates 1 inch (2.5 cm) from your body and provides you with +2 to
Armor. In addition, if struck by a melee attack, the field creates a
backlash that inflicts 4 points of electricity damage to the attacker.
Enabler.

Read the Signs (4 Intellect points): You examine an area and learn
precise, useful details about the past (if any exist). You can ask the
GM up to four questions about the immediate area; each requires its own
roll. Action.

Reading the Room (3 Intellect points): You gain knowledge about an area
by speaking with dead spirits or reading residual energies from the
past. You can ask the GM a single, matter-of-fact question about the
location and get an answer if you succeed on the Intellect roll. “What
killed the cattle in this barn?” is a good example of a simple question.
“Why were these cattle killed?” is not an appropriate question because
it has more to do with the mindset of the killer than the barn. Simple
questions usually have a difficulty of 2, but extremely technical
questions or those that involve facts meant to be kept secret can have a
much higher difficulty. Action.

Recruit Deputy: You gain a level 4 follower. They are not restricted on
their modifications. Alternatively, you can choose to advance a level 3
follower you already have to level 4 and then gain a new level 3
follower. Enabler.

Recycled Cyphers: All manifest cyphers you use function at one level
higher than normal. In addition, if given a week and at least ten items
of junk from the Junk table, you can tinker with one of your manifest
cyphers, transforming it into another cypher of the same type that you
had in the past. The GM and player should collaborate to ensure that the
transformation is logical— for example, you probably can’t transform a
pill into a helmet. Enabler.

Regenerate: Your ability to heal (whether from a potent spell, unique
mutation, or cybernetic graft) continues to function even if you die
from violence, as long as your body is mostly intact. One minute after
your death, this ability activates and brings you back to life; however,
you come back with a permanent 2-point deduction from your Intellect
Pool. Enabler. (A character might discover that Regenerate is both a
blessing and a curse, because relying on it too much leads to a kind of
malaise that vitality alone can‘t fix.)

Regenerate Other (9 Might points): You can confer your Regenerate
ability on another creature that you touch and attempt to return it to
life, as long as its body is mostly intact. (If you don’t have the
Regenerate ability, you gain it, but can use it only on yourself.) The
difficulty of the task is equal to 3 plus the number of days the target
has been dead. (If the body has been perfectly preserved in stasis or
through some other non-damaging preservation mechanism, no time limit
applies.) Enabler.

Regeneration (6 Intellect points): You restore points to a target’s
Might or Speed Pool in one of two ways: either the chosen Pool regains
up to 6 points, or it is restored to a total value of 12. You make this
decision when you initiate this ability. Points are regenerated at a
rate of 1 point each round. You must remain within immediate range of
the target the whole time, either touching them or conversing with them.
In no case can this raise a Pool higher than its maximum. Action.

Reinforcing Field (6+ Intellect points): You can reinforce any object or
structure by infusing it with a force field for one hour. The force
field increases the level of the object or structure by 2 for tasks
related to durability and withstanding damage and destruction. Action to
initiate.

Release Energy: You release 1 point of energy you’ve absorbed with your
Absorb Kinetic Energy ability, magnifying and focusing it into a blast
of energy that strikes a single foe within long range for 4 points of
damage. (If you don’t have any kinetic energy absorbed, you can still
use this ability, but it requires that you transform a fraction of
yourself into the blast, which costs 1 point of Might.) Action.

Reload (1 Speed point): When using a weapon that normally requires an
action to reload, such as a heavy crossbow, you can reload and fire (or
fire and reload) in the same action. Enabler.

Relocate (7 Intellect points): Choose one creature or object within
immediate range. You instantly transport it to a new position within
long range that you can see. The new position can be any direction from
you, but it cannot be inside a solid object. Action.

Remote Control (5 Intellect points): You can use a starcraft’s
communication and sensor arrays to launch an attack that briefly renders
an enemy starcraft within 20 miles (32 km) inoperative for up to a
minute. Action. (Remote Control is a masterful attempt to jam or hack an
enemy spacecraft, a task normally requiring multiple rolls, and you only
succeed if you roll a total of three successes before rolling a total of
two failures. However, all such tasks are hindered by at least two steps
due to hardened spacecraft electronic security.)

Remote Viewing (6 Intellect points): Distance is an illusion, as all
space is one space. With great concentration, you can see another place.
This ability can be used in one of two ways:

Distance and direction. Pick a spot a specific distance away and in a
specific direction. You can see from that vantage point as if you had
used the Sensor ability there, but only for one minute.

Think of a place you have seen before, either conventionally or using
the other application of this power. You can see from that vantage point
as if you had used the Sensor ability there, but only for one or two
rounds.

Either application takes anywhere from one action to hours of
concentration, depending on what the GM feels is appropriate due to
time, distance, or other mitigating circumstances. However, you don’t
know in advance how long it will take.

Action to initiate; action each round to concentrate.

Repair Flesh (3 Intellect points): When you touch an impaired or
debilitated character, you can move them up one step on the damage track
(for example, a debilitated PC becomes impaired, and an impaired one
becomes hale). Alternatively, if you use this ability on a PC during a
rest, you grant them a +2 bonus to their recovery roll. Action.

Repel Metal: By manipulating magnetism, you are trained in Speed defense
tasks against any incoming attack that uses metal. Enabler.

Reshape (5 Intellect points): You reshape matter within short range in
an area no larger than a 5-foot (1.5 m) cube. If you use only one action
on this ability, the changes you make are crude at best. If you spend at
least ten minutes and succeed at a hindered appropriate crafting task,
you can make complex changes to the material. You can’t change the
nature of the material, only its shape. Thus, you can make a hole in a
wall or floor, or you can seal one up. You can fashion a rudimentary
sword from a large piece of iron. You can break or repair a chain. With
multiple uses of this ability, you could bring about large changes,
making a bridge, a wall, or a similar structure. Action.

Resilience: You have 1 point of Armor against any kind of physical
damage, even physical damage that normally ignores Armor. Enabler.

Resilient Duplicate: Increase the health of  
any duplicate you create (such as with Duplicate) by 5. Enabler.

Resilient Ice Armor: The sheen of ice you generate using your Ice Armor
ability gives you an additional +1 to Armor. Enabler.

Resist the Elements: You resist heat, cold, and similar extremes. You
have a special +2 to Armor against ambient damage or other damage that
would normally ignore Armor. Enabler.

Resist Tricks: You’re trained in solving puzzles and recognizing tricks
from years of game playing. Enabler.

Resist Underwater Hazards: Whether you’re resisting crushing waters
while exploring the depths or a sting from a poisonous fish, all defense
tasks while submerged in water are eased. Enabler.

Resonance Field (1 Intellect point): Faint lines in a color you choose
form a tracery over your entire body and emit faint light. The effect
lasts for one minute. Whenever a creature within immediate range makes
an attack against you, the pattern energizes to block the attack. You
can make an Intellect defense roll in place of the defense roll you
would normally make. If you do so and you get a minor effect, the
creature attacking you takes 1 point of damage. If you get a major
effect, the creature attacking you takes 4 points of damage. Action to
initiate.

Resonant Frequency: You can infuse an item of up to level 7 that you can
hold in one hand with a special vibration generated from your core. The
object then functions as if two levels higher for one minute. At the end
of that minute, the resonant frequency ramps up exponentially until the
object finally shatters from the energy buildup. Anything within
immediate range of the detonation suffers 5 points of damage. Action to
initiate.

Resonant Quake (7 Intellect points): You can infuse the ground beneath
you with a special vibration generated from your core. This creates a
small quake whose epicenter you can select within a very long distance.
Everyone within short range of the epicenter is subject to 8 points of
damage (from shaking and being struck by toppling objects, crumbling
walls, and so on). However, you are dazed for a round afterward
yourself, during which time all your tasks are hindered. If you have the
Move Mountains ability, both abilities cost 3 fewer Intellect points to
use. Action.

Restful Presence: Creatures who make a recovery roll within short range
of you add +1 to their roll. Enabler.

Restore Life (9+ Intellect points): You can attempt to restore life to a
dead creature of up to level 3, as long as the corpse is no more than a
day old and is mostly intact. You can also attempt to restore life to a
corpse that is much older but is especially well preserved. The
difficulty of the Intellect task is equal to the level of the creature
you’re attempting to restore to life. For each additional level of
Effort applied, you can attempt to restore the life of a creature whose
level is 1 higher. When first restored to life, a creature is dazed for
at least a day, and all tasks they attempt are hindered. Action; one
minute to initiate.

Restorative Bloom (5 Might points): When Wooden Body or Great Tree is in
effect, you produce a flower, acorn, fruit, or similar plant-based
edible item. A creature that eats this food is nourished for a full day
and restores their Might Pool, Speed Pool, and Intellect Pool to their
maximum values, as if they were fully rested. Eating a second food
produced by this ability in a day has no effect. If the food is not
eaten within ten minutes, it spoils. Action to produce, action to eat.

Resuscitate (6 Intellect points): You can resuscitate a character who is
up to two steps down on the damage track as your action. The target
ascends one step on the damage track. If a character has dropped all
three steps on the damage track (dead) but is otherwise in one piece and
less than a minute has passed since they descended to the third step,
you can resuscitate them if you succeed at a level 6 healing task. If
you use this ability on an NPC who has no health but has been dead for
less than a minute and is otherwise in one piece, the NPC is
resuscitated with 1 health. Action.

Retinue: Four level 2 followers join you (and your first follower, if
you have one). One of their modifications must be for tasks related to
serving as your personal assistants. In addition to other tasks they
might individually take on your behalf, they can also work together to
run interference if you’re trying to avoid someone, help hide you from
the attention of others, help you muscle through a crowd, and so on. If
a situation becomes physically violent, they provide an asset to your
Speed defense tasks and, if you command it, try to hold a foe’s
attention while you escape. Enabler.

Retrieve Memories (3 Intellect points): You touch the remains of a
recently killed creature and make an Intellect-based roll to restore its
mind to life long enough to learn information from it. The GM sets the
difficulty based on the amount of time that has passed since the
creature died. A creature that has been dead for only a few minutes is a
difficulty 2 task, one that has been dead for an hour is a difficulty 4
task, and one that has been dead for a few days is a difficulty 9 task.
If you succeed, you awaken the corpse, causing its head to animate and
perceive things as if it were alive. This enables communication for
about one minute, which is how long it takes for the creature to realize
that it’s dead. The creature is limited to what it knew in life, though
it cannot recall minor memories, only big events of importance to it.
When the effect ends, or if you fail the roll, the creature’s brain
dissolves to mush and cannot be awakened again. Action.

Return to Sender (3 Speed points): If you succeed at a Speed defense
task against a melee attack, you can make an immediate melee attack
against your foe. You can use this ability only once per round. Enabler.

Return to the Obelisk (7+ Intellect points): You transfer your body and
personal possessions into a crystal of any size that you can touch, and
you exit from another crystal of any size, including any crystal
obelisks that you are aware of. You must know of the crystal you are
going to use as an exit before you enter the first crystal. You can take
one additional creature with you for each level of Effort applied.
Action.

Reveal (2+ Intellect points): You adjust a creature’s eyesight so that
it can see normally in areas of dim light and darkness. You can affect
one willing creature within immediate range for one hour. In addition to
the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to
affect more targets; each level of Effort applied affects two additional
targets. You must touch additional targets to affect them. Action to
initiate.

Ribbons of Dark Matter (2 Intellect points): For the next minute, dark
matter condenses within an area within long range that is no bigger than
an immediate distance in diameter, manifesting as swirling ribbons. All
tasks attempted by creatures in the area are hindered, and leaving the
area requires a creature’s entire action to move. You can dismiss the
dark matter early as an action. Action to initiate.

Rider: You are trained in riding any kind of creature that serves as a
mount, such as a noble warhorse. Enabler.

Roaming Third Eye (3 Intellect points): When you use your Third Eye
ability, you can place the sensor anywhere within long range. In
addition, until that ability ends, you can use an action to move the
sensor anywhere within short range of its starting position. Enabler.

Robot Assistant: A level 2 robot of your size or smaller (built by you)
accompanies you and follows your instructions. You and the GM must work
out the details of your robot. You’ll probably make rolls for it when it
takes actions. A robot assistant in combat usually doesn’t make separate
attacks but helps with yours. On your action, if the artificial
assistant is next to you, it serves as an asset for one attack you make
on your turn. If the robot is destroyed, you can repair the original
with a few days’ worth of tinkering, or build a new one with a week’s
worth of half-time labor. Enabler.

Robot Builder: You are trained in tasks related to building and
repairing robots. For the purposes of repair, you can use this skill to
heal robots that use similar technology. Enabler.

Robot Control (2+ Intellect points): You use your knowledge of robot
command and control (and possibly devices that transmit on the proper
frequency) to affect any mechanized system or robot of level 2 or lower
within short range. You can render several targets inactive for as long
as you focus all your attention on them. If you focus on just one
target, you can attempt to take active control of it for one minute,
commanding it to do simple tasks on your behalf while you concentrate.
In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to
use Effort to increase the maximum level of the mechanized system or
robot. Thus, to affect a level 4 target (two levels above the normal
limit), you must apply two levels of Effort. Action to initiate.

Robot Evolution: Your first artificial assistant from the Robot
Assistant ability increases to level 5, and each of your level 2 robots
from Robot Fleet increases to level 3. Instead of choosing this option,
you may instead choose one upgrade from the Robot Upgrade ability.
Enabler.

Robot Fighter: When fighting a robot or intelligent machine, you are
trained in attacks and defense. Enabler.

Robot Fleet: You build up to four level 2 robot assistants, each no
larger than yourself. (They are in addition to the assistant you built
at first tier with Robot Assistant, which may have seen a few upgrades
since then.) You and the GM must work out the details of these
additional robots. If a robot is destroyed, you can build a new one (or
repair the old one from its parts) after a week of half-time labor.
Instead of this ability, you can select one of the following abilities:
Expert Follower, Robot Control, or Robot Upgrade. Enabler.

Robot Improvement: Your artificial assistant from the Robot Assistant
ability increases to level 4. Enabler.

Robot Upgrade: You modify your artificial assistant from the Robot
Assistant ability with one new capability. Standard options include the
following. Work with your GM if you prefer a different capability.

*Cypher Pod.* The robot can carry one extra manifest cypher for you.
Enabler.

*Flight.* The robot can fly a long distance each round. It can carry
you, but only for up to an hour between each of your ten-hour recovery
rolls. Enabler.

*Force Shield.* The robot can erect an opaque level 5 force field around
itself and anyone within 10 feet (3 m) of it for one minute (or until it
is destroyed). It cannot do so again until after your next recovery
roll. Action.

*Mounted Laser Configuration.* The robot can reconfigure itself and
become an immobile laser weapon on a gimbal mount. In this
configuration, the robot is a heavy weapon that deals 7 points of
damage. If the robot acts as an autonomous turret, treat it as one level
lower than its normal level. However, if the laser is fired by you or
someone else who has your permission, the laser attacks are eased.
Action to reconfigure; action to return to normal robot configuration.

Ruin Lore: You are trained in scavenging, which means you’re more likely
to find useful things, and junk that can potentially be turned into
useful things in the ruins of what came before. Enabler.

Run and Fight (4 Might points): You can move a short distance and make a
melee attack that inflicts 2 additional points of damage. Action.

Runner: Your standard movement increases from short to long. Enabler.

Abilities—S

Safe Fall: You reduce the damage from a fall by 5 points. Enabler.

Sailor: You are trained in tasks related to sailing and trained in the
geography of islands and coastlines. Enabler.

Salvage and Comfort (2 Intellect points): You’re familiar with open
space. If you spend an hour using your spacecraft’s sensors and make a
difficulty 3 Intellect roll, you can find salvage in the form of
abandoned spacecraft, drifting motes of matter that were once inhabited,
or a place to hide from pursuit in what most people would otherwise
assume to be empty space (such as in a nebula, an asteroid field, or the
shadow of a moon). Salvage you turn up includes enough food and water
for you and several others, as well as the possibility of weapons,
clothing, technological artifacts, survivors, or other usable items. In
other contexts, this ability counts as training in tasks related to
perception. Action to initiate, one hour to complete.

Scan (2 Intellect points): You scan an area equal in size to a 10-foot
(3 m) cube, including all objects or creatures within that area. The
area must be within short range. Scanning a creature or object always
reveals its level. You also learn whatever facts the GM feels are
pertinent about the matter and energy in that area. For example, you
might learn that the wooden box contains a device of metal and plastic.
You might learn that the glass cylinder is full of poisonous gas, and
that its metal stand has an electrical field running through it that
connects to a metal mesh in the floor. You might learn that the creature
standing before you is a mammal with a small brain. However, this
ability doesn’t tell you what the information means. Thus, in the first
example, you don’t know what the metal and plastic device does. In the
second, you don’t know if stepping on the floor causes the cylinder to
release the gas. In the third, you might suspect that the creature is
not very intelligent, but scans, like looks, can be deceiving. Many
materials and energy fields prevent or resist scanning. Action.

Scramble Machine (2 Intellect points): You render one machine within
short range unable to function for one round. Alternatively, you can
hinder any action by the machine (or by someone attempting to use the
machine) for one minute. Action.

Scratch Existence (1+ Might points): You can choose to phase in a way
that “scratches” normal matter in a long streak as you run using Phase
Sprint. This tears a bit at you, too, reflected by the Might cost. When
you use Phase Sprint, you inflict 2 points of damage (ignores Armor) to
one target you select as you pass within immediate range, without
triggering Disrupting Touch. In addition to the normal options for using
Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the number of targets
along your path that you can attack as part of the same action. Make a
separate attack roll for each foe. You remain limited by the amount of
Effort you can apply on one action. Anything that modifies your attack
or damage applies to all of these attacks.

Alternatively, if you apply Effort to increase the damage rather than
ease the task, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level of
Effort (instead of 3 points); the target takes 1 point of damage even if
you fail the attack roll.

Enabler.

Sculpt Flesh (2 Intellect points): You cause a willing creature’s
fingers to lengthen into claws and their teeth to grow into fangs. The
effect lasts for ten minutes. The damage dealt by the target’s unarmed
strikes increases to 4 points. Action.

Sculpt Light (4 Intellect points): You create an object of solid light
in any shape you can imagine that is your size or smaller, and it
persists for about an hour. The object appears in an area adjacent to
you. It is crude and can have no moving parts, so you can make a sword,
a shield, a short ladder, and so on. The object has the approximate mass
of the real object and is level 4. Action.

Sea Legs: You have gotten used to rough seas and unexpected surges. You
are trained in balance. Any movement task that would be hindered by a
pitching deck, moving through rigging, and so on is a routine task for
you. Enabler.

See History (4 Intellect points): You touch an object, read the subtle
echoes of its existence through time, ask the GM a question about the
object’s past, and get a general answer. The answers are often in the
form of brief images or sensations rather than specific answers in a
language you know. The GM assigns a level to the question, so the more
obscure the answer, the more difficult the task. » Generally, knowledge
that you could find by looking somewhere other than your current
location is level 1, and obscure knowledge of the past is level 7. After
you use this ability, you have an asset on identifying the object.
Action. (“Obscure” is a relative term—a sage might not know how a
vampire acquired a specific artifact, but someone using See History on
that artifact would have an easy time sensing that event.)

See the Future (6 Intellect points): Based on all the variables you
perceive, you can predict the next few minutes. This has the following
effects:

For the next ten minutes, your defense rolls gain an asset.

You have a sort of danger sense. For the next ten minutes, you gain an
asset in seeing through deceptions and attempts to betray you, as well
as avoiding traps and ambushes.

You know what people are probably thinking and what they will say before
they say it. For the next ten minutes, you gain an asset to tasks
involving interaction and deception.

Enabler.

See the Unseen: You can automatically perceive creatures and objects
that are normally invisible, out of phase, or only partially in this
universe. When looking for things more conventionally hidden, the task
is eased. Enabler.

See Through Matter (3+ Intellect points): You can see through matter as
if it were transparent. You can see through up to 6 inches (15 cm) of
material for one round. Doing so is a task whose difficulty is equal to
the material or object’s level. In addition to the normal options for
using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to see through another 6
inches of material for each additional level of Effort you apply toward
that goal. Action.

See Through Time (7 Intellect points): Time is an illusion, as all time
is one time. With great concentration, you can see into another time.
You specify a time period regarding the place where you now stand.
Interestingly, the easiest time to view is about one hundred years in
the past or future. Viewing farther back or ahead is a nearly impossible
task.

This takes anywhere from one action to hours of concentration, depending
on what the GM feels is appropriate due to time, distance, or other
mitigating circumstances. However, you don’t know in advance how long it
will take.

Action to initiate; action each round to concentrate.

Seeds of Fury (1 Intellect point): You throw a handful of seeds in the
air that ignite and speed toward a target within long range, scratching
the air with twisting smoke trails. The attack deals 3 points of damage
and catches the target on fire, which inflicts 1 additional point of
damage per round for up to a minute or until the target uses an action
to douse the flames. Action.

Seize the Initiative (5 Intellect points): Within one minute of
successfully using your Draw Conclusion ability, you can take one
additional, immediate action, which you can take out of turn. After
using this ability, you can’t use it again until after your next
ten-hour recovery roll. Enabler.

Seize the Moment (4+ Speed points): If you succeed on a Speed defense
roll to resist an attack, you gain an action. You can use the action
immediately even if you have already taken a turn in the round. You
don’t take an action during the next round, unless you apply a level of
Effort when you use Seize the Moment. Enabler.

Sense Ambush: You are never surprised by an attack. Enabler.

Sense Attitudes: You are trained in sensing lies and whether a person is
likely to (or already does) believe your lies. Enabler.

Sensing Package: You can see in dim light and darkness as if it were
bright light, and you can see up to a short distance through fog, smoke,
and other obscuring phenomena. In addition, if you apply a level of
Effort to perception or searching tasks, you get a free level of Effort
on that task. Enabler.

Sensor (4 Intellect points): You create an immobile, invisible sensor
within immediate range that lasts for 24 hours. At any time during that
duration, you can concentrate to see, hear, and smell through the
sensor, no matter how far you move from it. The sensor doesn’t grant you
sensory capabilities beyond the norm. If you also have this ability from
another source, it lasts twice as long. Action to create; action to
check.

Sensor Array (3 Intellect points): You are trained in using starcraft
sensory instruments. These instruments allow users to answer general
questions about a location, such as “How many people are in the mining
colony?” or “Where did the other spacecraft crash?” Action.

Serv-0: You build a tiny robot assistant. It is level 1 and cannot take
independent actions or leave your immediate area. In truth, it’s more an
extension of you than a separate being. It gains a modification in using
machines and other technological devices. Enabler.

Serv-0 Aim: Your Serv-0 aids you in ranged combat. It gains a
modification in ranged attacks. Enabler.

Serv-0 Brawler: Your Serv-0 aids you in melee combat. It gains a
modification in melee attacks. Enabler.

Serv-0 Defender: Your Serv-0 aids you in combat by blocking attacks. It
gains a modification in Speed defense. Enabler.

Serv-0 Repair: Your Serv-0 aids you in repairing other devices. It gains
a modification in repair. Enabler.

Serv-0 Scanner (2 Intellect points): Your Serv-0 gains the Scan ability.
Enabler.

Serv-0 Spy (3 Intellect points): You can send your Serv-0 up to a long
distance away for up to ten minutes and see and hear through it as
though its senses were your own. You direct its movement. Action to
initiate.

Share Defense: If your training in a defense task is greater than that
of an ally within short range, your advice and insight allow them to
substitute your training for that defense task. Enabler.

Share the Power: When you use Drain Creature or Drain Machine to drain
energy, you can transfer it to another creature, restoring points to
their Might or Speed Pools (or health for an NPC) instead of yourself.
You can spend points from your Siphon Pool (from the Store Energy
ability) in the same way. You must touch the creature you want to heal,
unless you have the Drain at a Distance ability, in which case they can
be up to a short distance away. Enabler.

Share Senses: While your duplicate created by the Duplicate ability is
in existence and within 1 mile (1.5 km), you know everything it
experiences and can communicate with it telepathically. Enabler.

Sharp Senses: You are trained in all tasks involving perception.
Enabler.

Sharp-Eyed: Because you must always keep an eye out when you’re
traveling, you are trained in all tasks related to perception and
navigation. Enabler.

Shatter (2+ Intellect points): You interrupt the fundamental force
holding normal matter together for a moment, causing the detonation of
an object you choose within long range. The object must be a small,
mundane item composed of homogeneous matter (such as a clay cup, an iron
ingot, a stone, and so on). The object explodes in an immediate radius,
dealing 1 point of damage to all creatures and objects in the area. If
you apply Effort to increase the damage, you deal 2 additional points of
damage per level of Effort (instead of 3 points); targets in the area
take 1 point of damage even if you fail the attack roll. Action.

Shatter Mind (7+ Intellect points): Your words reverberate destructively
in the brain of an intelligent level 1 target within short range that
can hear and understand you. They destroy tissue, memories, and
personality, triggering a vegetative state. In addition to the normal
options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the
maximum level of the target. Thus, to shatter the mind of a level 5
target (four levels above the normal limit), you must apply four levels
of Effort. Action. (The vegetative state created by Shatter Mind can be
healed by advanced magic or science, or by a condition remover cypher
that cures psychosis.)

Shattering Shout (5+ Might points): Your focused shout sets up a
destructive resonance in a creature or object within long range. Nothing
happens on the round you strike your target other than an ominous
humming or buzzing sound emitted by the target. But on your next turn,
the resonance shatters discrete inanimate objects, inflicts major damage
to structures, or inflicts 4 points of damage on a creature (ignores
Armor).

If you shatter a discrete object, it shatters explosively, inflicting 1
point of damage on all creatures and objects within immediate range of
it. If you apply Effort to increase the damage rather than ease the
task, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level of Effort
(instead of 3 points); targets in the area take 1 point of damage even
if you fail the attack roll.

Action to initiate.

Shepherd’s Fury: You inflict 3 additional points of damage when engaging
in combat that directly relates to advancing the needs of a community
you are associated with. (You and the GM can decide whether a particular
situation warrants the additional damage.) Enabler.

Shield Burst: When you make a melee or ranged attack and hit with your
Force Field Shield, it releases an explosion of energy, inflicting an
additional 2 points of damage on the target and everything within
immediate range of the target. If you applied Effort to inflict
additional damage as part of the attack, each level of Effort inflicts
only 2 additional points to all targets instead of 3 points. If you use
Shield Burst with a melee attack, you and creatures behind you are not
affected by this explosion. If you use Shield Burst with a ranged
attack, the shield dissipates after the attack and then reforms in your
grasp. Enabler.

Shield Master: When you use a shield, in addition to the asset it gives
you (easing Speed defense tasks), you can act as if you are trained in
Speed defense tasks. However, in any round in which you use this
benefit, your attacks are hindered. Enabler.

Shield Training: If you use a shield, Speed defense tasks are eased by
two steps instead of one. Enabler.

Ship Footing (3 Speed points): For ten minutes, all tasks you attempt
while on a spaceship are eased. Action to initiate.

Shipspeak: You can make basic maneuvers from a planetary distance with a
starship that you have bonded with using Machine Bond. You can send it
to a designated place, call it to you, have it land, allow or deny
entrance, and so on, even if you are not on board. Bonding is a process
that requires a day of meditation while jacked into the ship. Action.

Shock (1 Intellect point): Your hands crackle with electricity, and the
next time you touch a creature, you inflict 3 points of damage.
Alternatively, if you wield a weapon, for ten minutes it crackles with
electricity and inflicts 1 additional point of damage per attack. Action
for touch; enabler for weapon.

Short Teleportation (4+ Intellect points): You instantly teleport to any
location within a short distance that you can see. In addition to the
normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to
increase your range, teleport to a location you can’t see, or bring
other people with you. Each additional short distance costs one level of
Effort. Teleporting to a destination you can’t see costs one level of
Effort. Each additional target brought with you costs one level of
Effort (you must touch any additional targets). These levels of Effort
are counted separately, so teleporting an additional short distance away
to a location you can’t see with one passenger costs a total of three
levels of Effort. Action.

If you already have Short Teleportation when you select Medium
Teleportation or Teleportation, you may replace Short Teleportation with
another tier 4 type ability.

Show Them the Way (6+ Intellect points): Your presence overwhelms a
creature that you touch and ask to aid you. Essentially, if the creature
fails to defend against your presence, you control its actions for up to
ten minutes. The target must be level 3 or lower. Once you have
established control, you maintain control through verbal instruction.
You can allow the target to act freely or override control on a case-by
case basis. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can
choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus,
to affect a level 5 target (two levels above the normal limit), you must
apply two levels of Effort. When the effect ends, the creature vaguely
remembers doing your will, but it’s as blurry as a dream. Action to
initiate.

Shred Existence: When you use Disrupting Touch, Scratch Existence, or
Phase Detonation, you inflict an additional 5 points of damage that
ignores Armor. Enabler.

Shroud of Flame (1 Intellect point): At your command, your entire body
becomes shrouded in flames that last up to ten minutes. The fire doesn’t
burn you, but it automatically inflicts 2 points of damage to anyone who
tries to touch you or strike you with a melee attack. Flames from
another source can still hurt you. While the shroud is active, you gain
+2 Armor against damage from fire from another source. Enabler.

Shrink (1+ Might points): You (and your clothing or suit) become much
smaller than your normal size. You become 6 inches (15 cm) tall and stay
that way for about a minute. During this time, you add 4 points to your
Speed Pool and add +2 to your Speed Edge. While you are smaller than
normal, your Speed defense rolls are eased, your movement speed is
one-tenth normal, and your attacks inflict half the normal amount of
damage (divide the total damage in half after all bonuses, Effort, and
other damage modifiers). You can return to your normal size as part of
another action.

When the effects of Shrink end, your Speed Edge, movement speed, and
damage return to normal, and you subtract a number of points from your
Speed Pool equal to the number you gained (if this brings the Pool to 0,
subtract the overflow first from your Might Pool and then, if necessary,
from your Intellect Pool). Each additional time you use Shrink before
your next ten-hour recovery roll, you must apply an additional level of
Effort (one level of Effort for the second use, two levels of Effort for
the third use, and so on).

Action to initiate.

The increased Effort cost for repeat uses of Shrink between ten-hour
recovery rolls only applies to new activations of Shrink, not to
multiple size changes within one use of Shrink enabled by Quick Switch.

Shrink Others: You can use Shrink on other willing creatures within an
immediate distance. In addition to the normal options for using Effort,
you can choose to use Effort to affect more targets; each level of
Effort affects one additional target. Unless these creatures have an
ability to change their size, they remain small until the one-minute
duration of Shrink ends for them. Enabler.

Silent As Space: By taking advantage of microgravity conditions, you
gain an asset to stealth and initiative tasks while in zero-gravity or
low-gravity conditions. Enabler.

Skill With Attacks: Choose one type of attack in which you are not
already trained: light bashing, light bladed, light ranged, medium
bashing, medium bladed, medium ranged, heavy bashing, heavy bladed, or
heavy ranged. You are trained in attacks using that type of weapon. You
can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you
must choose a different type of attack. Enabler.

Skill With Defense: Choose one type of defense task in which you are not
already trained: Might, Speed, or Intellect. You are trained in defense
tasks of that type. Enabler.

Sleuth: Finding the clues is the first step in solving a mystery. You
are trained in perception. Enabler.

Slice (2 Speed points): This is a quick attack with a bladed or pointed
weapon that is hard to defend against. You are trained in this task. If
the attack is successful, it deals 1 less point of damage than normal.
Action.

Slip Into Shadow (2+ Intellect points): You attempt to slip away from a
selected target and hide from view in a nearby shadow, behind a tree or
a furnishing, or in the next room, even if in full view of the target.
For each level of Effort applied, you can attempt to affect one
additional target, as long as all your targets are next to each other.
Action to initiate.

Slippery: You are trained in escaping any kind of bond or grasp.
Enabler.

Slippery Customer: When you apply Effort to tasks involving escaping
from bonds, fitting in tight spaces, and other contortionist tasks, you
get a free level of Effort on the task. Thanks to your experience, you
are also trained in Speed defense tasks while wearing light armor or no
armor. Enabler.

Small Flight (3+ Intellect points): For the next hour, when using
Shrink, you can fly through the air. You might accomplish this flight by
growing wings from your body, extending wings from your suit, calling a
tiny creature to carry you, or “surfing” air currents. When flying, you
can move up to a short distance as part of another action or a long
distance if all you do on your turn is move. Action to initiate.

Smaller: When you use Shrink, you can choose to shrink down to about
half an inch (1 cm) high, and you add 3 more temporary points to your
Speed Pool. Enabler.

Snap Shot: You can make two gun attacks as a single action, but the
second attack is hindered by two steps. Enabler.

Sneak: You are trained in stealth and initiative tasks. Enabler.

Snipe (2 Speed points): If you spend one action aiming, in the next
round you can make a precise ranged attack. You have an asset on this
attack. If your attack is successful, it inflicts 4 additional points of
damage. Action.

Sniper’s Aim: By dint of almost constant practice playing games that
simulate making ranged attacks, your hand-eye coordination is off the
chart. You have an asset on all ranged attacks. Enabler.

Something in the Road: When you use a vehicle as a weapon, you inflict 5
additional points of damage. Enabler.

Soothe Mind and Body: The body and the mind are connected. All healing
tasks you attempt are eased by two steps. Enabler.

Soothe the Savage (2 Intellect points): You calm a nonhuman beast within
30 feet (9 m). You must speak to it (although it doesn’t need to
understand your words), and it must see you. It remains calm for one
minute or for as long as you focus all your attention on it. The GM has
final say over what counts as a nonhuman beast, but unless some kind of
deception is at work, you should know whether you can affect a creature
before you attempt to use this ability on it. Aliens, extradimensional
entities, very intelligent creatures, and robots never count. Action.

Soul Interrogation (5 Intellect points): You determine the weaknesses,
vulnerabilities, qualities, and mannerisms of a single creature within
long range. The GM should reveal the creature’s level, basic abilities,
and obvious weaknesses (if any). All actions you attempt that affect
that creature—attack, defense, interaction, and so on—are eased for a
few months afterward. Action.

Sound Conversion Barrier: Attacks that hit you—especially energy attacks
like focused light, heat, radiation, and transdimensional energy—are
partially converted to surges of harmless noise similar to the sound of
a wave crashing to shore. This ability grants you +1 Armor against all
attacks and an additional +2 Armor against energy attacks. Enabler.

Space Fighting: By taking advantage of microgravity conditions, you can
use inertia and mass to your advantage. If you spend a round setting up
a melee attack (or an attack from a thrown or launched object) while in
zero-gravity or low-gravity conditions, the attack inflicts 6 additional
points of damage. Enabler.

Speaker for the Dead (2+ Intellect points): You can ask a question of a
dead being whose corpse you are touching. Because the answer comes
through the filter of the being’s understanding and personality, it
can’t answer questions that it wouldn’t have understood in life, and it
can’t provide answers that it wouldn’t have known in life. In fact, the
being is not compelled to answer at all, so you might need to interact
with it in a way that would have convinced it to answer while it was
alive. For each additional Intellect point you spend when you activate
the ability, you can ask the being an additional question. Action.

Special Shot: When you hit a target with a gun attack, you can choose to
reduce the damage by 1 point but hit the target in a precise spot. Some
of the possible effects include (but are not limited to) the following:

You can shoot an object out of someone’s hand.

You can shoot the leg, wing, or other limb it uses to move, reducing its
maximum movement speed to immediate for a few days or until it receives
expert medical care.

You can shoot a strap holding a backpack, armor, or a similarly
strapped-on item so that it falls off.

Enabler.

Specialized Basher: You are specialized in using the stone fists from
your Golem Body ability as a medium weapon. Enabler.

Specialized Throwing: You are specialized in attacks with all weapons
that you throw. Enabler.

Speed Burst (4 Speed points): You can take two separate actions in this
round. In the following round, all actions are hindered. You cannot use
this ability two rounds in a row. Enabler.

Speedy Recovery (3 Intellect points): Your words enhance the normal
regenerative ability of a character within short range who is able to
understand you. When they make a recovery roll, they must spend only
half the normal amount of time required to do so (minimum one action).
Action.

Spin Attack (5+ Speed points): You stand still and make attacks against
up to five foes, all as part of the same action in one round. All of the
attacks have to be the same sort of attack (melee or ranged). Make a
separate attack roll for each foe. You remain limited by the amount of
Effort you can apply on one action. Anything that modifies your attack
or damage applies to all of these attacks. In addition to the normal
options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the
number of foes you can attack with this ability (one additional foe per
level of Effort used in this way). Action.

Spin Identity (2+ Intellect points): You convince all intelligent
creatures who can see, hear, and understand you that you are someone or
something other than who you actually are. You don’t impersonate a
specific individual known to the victim. Instead, you convince the
victim that you are someone they do not know belonging to a certain
category of people. “We’re from the government.” “I’m just a simple
farmer from the next town over.” “Your commander sent me.” A disguise
isn’t necessary, but a good disguise will almost certainly be an asset
to the roll involved. If you attempt to convince more than one creature,
the Intellect cost increases by 1 point per additional victim. Fooled
creatures remain so for up to an hour, unless your actions or other
circumstances reveal your true identity earlier. Action.

Spirit Accomplice: A level 3 spirit accompanies you and follows your
instructions. The spirit must remain within immediate range—if it moves
farther away, it fades at the end of your following turn and cannot
return for a day. You and the GM must work out the details of your
spirit accomplice, and you’ll probably make rolls for it when it takes
actions. The spirit accomplice acts on your turn, can move a short
distance each round, and exists partially out of phase (allowing it to
move through walls, though it makes a poor porter). The spirit takes up
residence in an object you designate, and it manifests as either an
invisible presence or a ghostly shade. Your spirit accomplice is
specialized in one knowledge skill the GM determines.

The spirit is normally insubstantial, but if you use an action and spend
3 Intellect points, it accretes enough substance to affect the world
around it. As a level 3 creature with substance, it has a target number
of 9 and a health of 9. It doesn’t attack creatures, but while
substantial, it can use its action to serve as an asset for any one
attack you make on your turn.

While corporeal, the spirit can’t move through objects or fly. A spirit
remains corporeal for up to ten minutes at a time, but fades back to
being insubstantial if not actively engaged. If your spirit accomplice
is destroyed, it reforms in 1d6 days, or you can attract a new spirit in
2d6 days. Enabler. (An insubstantial creature can’t affect or be
affected by anything unless indicated otherwise, such as when an attack
is made with a special weapon. An insubstantial creature can pass
through solid matter without hindrance, but solid energy barriers, such
as magical fields of force, keep it at bay.)

Spot Weakness: If a creature that you can see has a special weakness,
such as a vulnerability to fire, a negative modification to perception,
or so on, you know what it is. (Ask and the GM will tell you.) Enabler.

Spray (2 Speed points): If a weapon has the ability to fire rapid shots
without reloading (usually called a rapid-fire weapon, such as a crank
crossbow or submachine gun), you can spray multiple shots around your
target to increase the chance of hitting. This ability uses 1d6 + 1
rounds of ammo (or all the ammo in the weapon, if it has less than the
number rolled). You are trained in making this attack. If the attack is
successful, it deals 1 less point of damage than normal. You can also
use this ability on multiple thrown weapons (stones, shuriken, daggers,
and so on) if you‘re carrying them on your person or they are all within
reach. Action.

Spring Away (5 Speed points): Whenever you succeed on a Speed defense
roll, you can immediately move up to a short distance. You cannot use
this ability more than once in a given round. Enabler.

Sprint and Grab (2 Speed points): You can run a short distance and make
a melee attack to grab a foe of your size or smaller. A successful
attack means you grab the foe and bring it to a halt if it was moving
(this can be treated as a tackle, if appropriate). Action.

Spur Effort (5 Intellect points): You select an ally within immediate
range. If that character applies Effort to a task on their next turn,
they can apply a free level of Effort on that task. Enabler.

Stalker: You gain an asset to all types of movement tasks (including
climbing, swimming, jumping, and balancing). Enabler.

Stand Watch (2 Intellect points): While standing watch (mostly remaining
in place for an extended period of time), you unfailingly remain awake
and alert for up to eight hours. During this time, you are trained in
perception tasks as well as stealth tasks to conceal yourself from those
who might approach. Action to initiate.

Stare Them Down: One doesn’t play games of chicken with other maniac
drivers without gaining mental strength. You’re trained in Intellect
defense tasks. Enabler.

Stasis (3 Intellect points): You surround a foe of your size or smaller
with scintillating energy, keeping it from moving or acting for one
minute, as if frozen solid. You must be able to see the target, and it
must be within short range. While in stasis, the target is impervious to
harm, cannot be moved, and is immune to all effects. Action.

Stay the Course (5 Intellect points): When your companions are flagging,
you can help inspire them with a well-timed word or two. Any ally
(except you) within immediate range can make a recovery roll that is not
an action and does not count toward their daily limit. Action.

Steal Power: When you use Copy Power to copy an ability, the creature
you copied it from loses access to that ability for about a minute.
While you have their ability, any attempt by the creature to use their
ability requires them to succeed at a task (Might, Speed, or Intellect,
as appropriate to the stolen ability) opposed by your eased Intellect
task. If they succeed, they regain the use of their ability and you lose
it. Enabler.

If you want to make it more difficult for someone to take back their
stolen power, become skilled in the Steal Power ability, or put a power
shift in power for it.

Stealth Skills: You are trained in your choice of two of the following
skills: disguise, deception, lockpicking, pickpocketing, seeing through
deception, sleight of hand, or stealth. You can choose this ability
multiple times, but you must select different skills each time. Enabler.

Still As a Statue (5 Might points): Drawing upon the power of your Golem
Body, you freeze in place, burying your essence deep in your stone core.
During this time, you lose all mobility as well as the ability to take
physical actions. You cannot sense what’s happening around you, and no
time seems to pass for you. While Still As a Statue, you gain +10 to
Armor against damage of all sorts. Under normal circumstances, you
automatically rouse to normal wakefulness and mobility a day later. If
an ally you trust shakes you hard enough (with a minimum cost of 2 Might
points), you rouse earlier. Action to initiate.

Stimulate (6 Intellect points): Your words encourage a target you touch
who can understand you. The next action it takes is eased by three
steps. Action.

Stone Breaker: Your attacks against objects inflict 4 additional points
of damage when you use a melee weapon that you wield in two hands.
Enabler.

Store Energy: When you drain energy with your focus abilities, you can
store some of it for later in a Siphon Pool. You can spend points from
your Siphon Pool as if they were from your Might or Speed Pool, or use
an action to spend them to restore an equal number of points to your
Might or Speed Pool. Your Siphon Pool can safely store up to 3 points;
each point beyond that hinders all of your tasks. Enabler.

Storm Seed (3 Intellect points): If outside or in a large-enough
enclosed space, you can seed a natural storm of a kind common to the
area. Doing so requires at least an hour’s concentration as you use your
connection to the air (whether this is due to nanobots, elemental
spirits, magic, or some other source) to initiate proper conditions,
though it could take longer if the GM feels there are additional
obstacles at play. Once the storm begins, it lasts for about ten
minutes. Once during that period, you can create a more dramatic and
specific effect appropriate to that kind of storm, such as a lightning
strike, a squall of giant hailstones, the brief touchdown of a twister,
a single gust of hurricane-force winds, and so on. These effects must
occur within long range of your location. You must spend your turn
concentrating to create the effect, which occurs a round later. The
effect inflicts 6 points of damage, after which the storm begins to
disperse. Action to initiate, an hour or more to complete. (Storm Seed
usually calls thunderstorms, but in an area where stranger weather is
common, a Storm Seed could call that instead. For instance, some
settings have particular kinds of magical weather.)

Straightforward: You are trained in one of the following tasks (choose
one): breaking things, climbing, jumping, or running. Enabler.

Strategize (6 Intellect points): Having an action plan in place before
facing a challenge improves the odds of success, even if that plan is
eventually changed or discarded once it’s put into play. If you and your
allies spend at least ten minutes going over a plan of action, all of
you gain one free level of Effort that can be applied to one task you
attempt during the execution of that plan within the next 24 hours. The
plan of action must be something concrete and executable in order to
gain this benefit. Action to initiate, ten minutes to complete.

Stronger Together: When you and your companion from the Beast Companion
ability are within immediate distance of each other, you inflict 2
additional points of damage when you attack and both of you gain an
asset to defense actions. Enabler.

Stun Attack (6 Speed points): You attempt a difficulty 5 Speed task to
stun a creature as part of your melee or ranged attack. If you succeed,
your attack inflicts its normal damage and stuns the creature for one
round, causing it to lose its next turn. If you fail, you still make
your normal attack roll, but you don’t stun the opponent if you hit. If
you also have this ability from another source (such as having it as a
type ability and a focus ability), using this costs you only 3 points
instead of 6 points. Action.

Sturdy: You are trained in Might defense tasks. Enabler.

Subconscious Defense: Your subconscious constantly runs predictive
models for avoiding danger. You gain an asset on your Speed defense
tasks. Enabler.

Subsonic Rumble (2 Intellect points): For one minute or until you use
some other sound manipulation ability, you emit a subsonic rumble that
most living creatures can’t hear but which has an effect on them all the
same. The effect lasts for one minute and affects all creatures you
select within short range. All tasks related to resisting persuasion,
intimidation, and fear are hindered by two steps for affected targets.
Action to initiate.

Subtle Steps: When you move no more than a short distance, you can move
without making a sound, regardless of the surface you move across.
Enabler.

Subtle Tricks: You can use your skills and special abilities in ways
that don’t look like you’re doing anything. If the skill or ability
would normally require an obvious movement, phrase, or other action by
you, it instead seems to happen on its own. Instead of using your tools
to pick a lock, the lock clicks open as you stand near it. Instead of
manipulating a computer screen, the information you want appears on the
screen when you look at it. Instead of bluffing your way past some
guards, they step aside as you approach and let you through. This
ability usually only works up to an immediate distance. You still must
spend points and make rolls to use your skills and abilities with Subtle
Tricks. Using a skill or ability in a subtle way hinders the task. This
ability can’t be used to conceal your attack or defense rolls. Enabler.

Successive Attack (2 Speed points): If you take down a foe, you can
immediately make another attack on that same turn against a new foe
within your reach. The second attack is part of the same action. You can
use this ability with melee attacks and ranged attacks. Enabler.

Suggestion (5+ Intellect points): You suggest an action to a creature
within immediate range. If the action is something that the target might
normally do anyway, it follows your suggestion. If the suggestion is
something that is outside of the target’s nature or express duty (such
as asking a guard to let an intruder pass), the suggestion fails. The
creature must be level 2 or lower. The effect of your suggestion lasts
for up to a minute.

In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to
use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target you can affect
by 1. Thus, to affect a level 5 target (three levels above the normal
limit), you must apply three levels of Effort.

When the effects of the ability end, the creature remembers following
the suggestion but can be persuaded to believe that it chose to do so
willingly.

Action to initiate.

Summon Demon (7+ Intellect points): A demon appears within immediate
range. If you applied a level of Effort as part of the summoning, the
demon is amenable to your instructions; otherwise, it acts according to
its nature. Regardless, the demon persists for up to one minute before
it fades away—you hope. Action to initiate.

Summon Giant Spider (4+ Intellect points): A giant spider appears within
immediate range. If you applied a level of Effort as part of the
summoning, the spider is amenable to your instructions; otherwise, it
acts according to its nature. Regardless, the creature persists for up
to one minute before it fades away. Action to initiate.

Sun Siphon: The safe limit of your Siphon Pool from the Store Energy
ability increases by 3 points. If you spend an hour in sunlight (or an
hour in contact with a suitable powerful energy source), you
automatically fill your Siphon Pool to its safe limit. You can’t refill
your Siphon Pool this way again until after your next ten-hour recovery
roll. Enabler.

Sunlight (3 Intellect points): A mote of light travels from you to a
spot you choose within long range. When the mote reaches that spot, it
flares and casts bright light in a 200-foot (60 m) radius, and darkness
within 1,000 feet (300 m) of the mote becomes dim light. The light lasts
for one hour or until you use an action to dismiss it. Action.

Superb Explorer: You are trained in searching, listening, climbing,
balancing, and jumping tasks. Enabler.

Superb Infiltrator: You are trained in lockpicking and tinkering with
devices in an effort to make them work, or at least work for you.
Enabler.

Superior Duplicate (2 Might points): When you use your Duplicate
ability, you can create a superior duplicate instead of a normal
duplicate. A superior duplicate is a level 3 NPC with 15 health.
Enabler.

Surging Confidence (1 Might point): When you use an action to make your
first recovery roll of the day, you immediately gain another action.
Enabler.

Surprise Attack: If attacking from a hidden vantage, with surprise, or
before your opponent has acted, you get an asset on the attack. On a
successful hit, you inflict 2 additional points of damage. Enabler.

Swim (1+ Intellect points): You can swim like a fish through water and
similar liquid for one hour. For each level of Effort applied, you can
extend the duration by one hour. You swim about 10 miles (16 km) per
hour, and you are not affected by currents in the water. Action to
initiate.

Swipe (1 Speed point): This is a quick, agile melee attack. Your attack
inflicts 1 less point of damage than normal but dazes your target for
one round, during which time all tasks it performs are hindered. Action.

Abilities—T

Take Command (3 Intellect points): You issue a specific command to
another character. If that character chooses to listen, any attack they
attempt on their next turn is eased, and a hit deals 3 additional points
of damage. If your command is to perform a task other than an attack,
the task is eased as if it benefited from a free level of Effort.
Action.

Taking Advantage: When your foe is weakened, dazed, stunned, moved down
the damage track, or disadvantaged in some other way, your attacks
against that foe are eased beyond any other modifications due to the
disadvantage. Enabler.

Tall Tale (3 Intellect points): You tell a short anecdote to a foe that
can understand you about something you’ve witnessed in your life that’s
so over the top yet so convincing that, if you are successful, the foe
is dazed for one minute, during which time its tasks are hindered.
Action.

Targeting Eye: You are trained in any physical ranged attack that is a
character ability or comes from a device. For example, you are trained
when using an Onslaught force blast because it’s a physical attack, but
not when using an Onslaught mindslice because it’s a mental attack.
Enabler.

Task Specialization: Choose one task (other than attacks or defense)
that you are trained in. You become specialized in that task. (You can
instead use this ability as Task Training to become trained in a task
you aren’t trained in.) Enabler.

Task Training: Choose one task (other than attacks or defense) that you
are not trained or specialized in. You become trained in that task.
Enabler.

Taunt Foe (4 Might or Intellect points): You can make an attack on a foe
as part of drawing an attack (which is not something you can do normally
when attempting to draw an attack). In cases where an intelligent or
determined foe isn’t drawn to you, you can attempt an Intellect action
as part of the attack. If that Intellect action is successful, the foe
attacks you. Your defenses against that attack are hindered by one step,
instead of being hindered by two steps as normal when drawing an attack.
Enabler.

Teach Trick (5+ Intellect points): You spend an hour instructing someone
on how to perform a type ability that you know. The ability must be no
higher than fourth tier. For one hour after you teach them, the student
can perform that ability as if it were natural for them. They must pay
the Might, Speed, or Intellect cost (if any) to use that ability. The
student must be able to understand your instructions. In addition to the
normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to
increase how long the student can use the ability or to teach additional
students at the same time; each level of Effort used in this way
increases the duration by one hour or the number of students by one. One
hour to initiate. Action; hour to complete.

Teamwork: Through example, acts of camaraderie, stories of martial
prowess, or other forms of instruction, you and your allies work better
together as a cohesive unit. During any round in which you rally your
team (by spending 2 Intellect points as part of another action), you and
your allies inflict 1 additional point of damage in combat. This benefit
applies only to allies with whom you have spent the last 24 hours. It
ends if you leave, but it resumes if you return to your allies’ company
within 24 hours. If you leave for more than 24 hours, you must spend
another 24 hours together to reactivate the benefit. Enabler.

Tech Skills: You are trained in two skills in which you are not already
trained. Choose two of the following: crafting, computers, identifying,
machines, piloting, repairing, or vehicle driving. You can select this
ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two
different skills. Enabler.

Telekinesis (2 Intellect points): You can exert force on objects within
short range. Once activated, your power has an effective Might Pool of
10, a Might Edge of 1, and an Effort of 2 (approximately equal to the
strength of a fit, capable adult human), and you can use it to move
objects, push against objects, and so on. For example, you could lift
and pull a light object anywhere within range to yourself or move a
heavy object (like a piece of furniture) about 10 feet (3 m). This power
lacks the fine control to wield a weapon or move objects with much
speed, so in most situations, it’s not a means of attack. You can’t use
this ability on your own body. The power lasts for one hour or until its
Might Pool is depleted, whichever comes first. Action. (If you’re using
Telekinesis to move an object across the room, and an average fit human
could do it with their arms, you can do it with your psychokinesis. You
have to use the power’s Might Pool, Might Edge, and Effort only if a PC
would have to do so, such as if a character tried to push open a barred
door.)

Telepathic (1+ Intellect points): You can speak telepathically with
others who are within short range. Communication is two-way, but the
other party must be willing and able to communicate. You don’t have to
see the target, but you must know that it’s within range. You can have
more than one active contact at once, but you must establish contact
with each target individually. Each contact lasts up to ten minutes. If
you apply a level of Effort to increase the duration rather than ease
the task, the contact lasts for 24 hours. Action to establish contact.

Telepathic Network (0+ Intellect points): When you wish it, you can
contact up to ten creatures known to you, no matter where they are. All
targets must be willing and able to communicate. You automatically
succeed at establishing a telepathic network; no roll is required. All
creatures in the network are linked and can communicate telepathically
with one another. They can also “overhear” anything said in the network,
if they wish. Activating this ability doesn’t require an action and
doesn’t cost Intellect points; to you, it’s as easy as speaking out
loud. The network lasts until you choose to end it. If you spend 5
Intellect points, you can contact twenty creatures at once, and for
every 1 Intellect point you spend above that, you can add ten more
creatures to the network. These larger networks last for ten minutes.
Creating a network of twenty or more creatures does require an action to
establish contact. Enabler.

Teleportation (6+ Intellect points): You instantaneously transmit
yourself to any location that you have seen or been to, no matter the
distance, as long as it is on Earth (or whatever world you’re currently
on). In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose
to use Effort to bring other people with you; each level of Effort used
in this way affects up to three additional targets. You must touch any
additional targets. Action.

Teleportation Burst (3 Intellect points): You rapidly teleport multiple
times in an immediate area, confusing your opponents and allowing you to
make an additional melee attack this round. You can use this ability
once per round. Enabler.

Teleportive Wound (7+ Intellect points): You touch a creature and, if
your attack succeeds, you teleport away (up to your normal maximum
teleportation distance) with a significant portion of their body. If the
target is level 2 or lower, it dies. If the target is level 3 or higher,
it takes 6 points of damage and is stunned on its next action. If the
target is a PC of any tier, they move down one step on the damage track.
In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to
use Effort to affect a more powerful target (one level of Effort means a
target of up to level 3 dies or a target of level 4 or higher takes
damage and is stunned, and so on). Action.

Telling (2 Intellect points): This ability provides an asset to any
tasks for attempting to deceive, persuade, or intimidate. Each use lasts
up to a minute; a new use (to switch tasks) replaces the previous use.
Action to initiate.

Temporal Acceleration (5 Intellect points): You or one willing creature
you touch moves more quickly through time. The effect lasts for one
minute. Everything moves more slowly for the affected character, while
to all others, the character seems to move at preternatural speed. The
character has an asset on all tasks until the effect ends. After the
effect ends, the target is exhausted and disoriented by the experience,
hindering all tasks for one hour. Action.

Temporal Dislocation (7 Intellect points): You disappear and travel up
to one hour into the future or the past. While dislocated in time, you
perceive events as they transpire from your position using your normal
senses, but you can’t interact with or change anything. If you project
yourself into the past, you remain there for one hour, at which point
you’ve caught up to the present (to anyone with you in the present, you
only seem to flicker out of existence for a moment). If you project
yourself into the future, you remain there until the present catches up
to you (to anyone with you in the present, you vanish for one hour and
reappear in the place you left). Action.

Temporary Light (2 Intellect points): You create an object of solid
light in any shape you can imagine that is your size or smaller, and it
persists for about a minute (or longer, if you concentrate on it after
that time). The object appears in an area adjacent to you, but afterward
you can move it up to a short distance each round as part of another
action. It is crude and can have no moving parts, so you can make a
sword, a shield, a short ladder, and so on. The object has the
approximate mass of the real object and is level 2. Action.

Terrifying Gaze (6 Intellect points): You project a chilling gaze at all
living creatures within short range who can see you. Make a separate
Intellect attack roll for each target. Success means that the creature
is frozen in fear, not moving or taking actions for one minute or until
it is attacked. Some creatures without minds (such as robots) might be
immune to Terrifying Gaze. Action.

Terrifying Image (6 Intellect points): You use a bit of subtle telepathy
to learn which images would appear terrifying to creatures that you
choose within long range. Those images appear within that area and
menace the appropriate creatures. Make an Intellect attack roll against
each creature you want to affect. Success means the creature flees in
terror for one minute, pursued by its nightmares. Failure means the
creature ignores the images, which do not hamper it in any way. Action.

Terrifying Presence (2+ Intellect points): You convince one intelligent
target of level 3 or lower that you are its worst nightmare. The target
must be within short range and be able to understand you. For as long as
you do nothing but speak (you can’t even move), the target is paralyzed
with fear, runs away, or takes some other action appropriate to the
circumstances. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you
can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target.
Thus, to terrorize a level 5 target (two levels above the normal limit),
you must apply two levels of Effort. Action.

There’s Your Problem: You are trained in tasks related to figuring out
how to solve problems with multiple solutions (like the best way to pack
a truck, calm an enraged customer, give a cat a shot of insulin, or find
a route through the city for maximum speed). Enabler.

Thief’s Luck: Luck is not the chaotic ocean of random chance most people
believe it to be. If you fail on a task (including an attack roll or a
defense roll), you can change the die result to a natural 20. That still
might not be enough to succeed if the difficulty is higher than 6. Once
you use this ability, it is not available again until after you make a
ten-hour recovery roll. (Thief’s Luck doesn’t work if you roll a natural
1 for an attempted task, unless you also have and use the ability Wrest
From Chance.) Enabler.

Think Your Way Out: When you wish it, you can use points from your
Intellect Pool rather than your Might Pool or Speed Pool on any
noncombat action. Enabler.

Thinking Ahead (variable Intellect points): You produce a remedy that
removes a negative condition because you’ve previously spent
considerable time thinking ahead and preparing for your current
situation. For instance, if another character is poisoned, you produce
an antidote, or if they’re blinded, you produce a salve that returns
sight (assuming they weren’t blinded because their eyes were destroyed).
The Intellect cost for using this ability is equal to the level of
effect or creature that caused the negative condition. Action.

Third Eye (1 Intellect point): You visualize a place within short range
and cast your mind to that place, creating an immobile, invisible sensor
for one minute or until you choose to end this ability. While using your
third eye, you see through your sensor instead of your eyes using your
normal visual abilities. You may perceive the area around your body
using your other senses as normal. Action.

Throw (2 Might points): When you are using Enlarge and deal damage to a
creature of your size or smaller with an unarmed attack, you can choose
to throw that creature up to 1d20 feet away from you. The creature lands
prone. Enabler.

Throw Enchanted Weapon: You can throw your enchanted weapon up to short
range as a light ranged weapon. Whether it hits or misses, it
immediately flies back to your hands, and you can automatically catch it
or allow it to land at your feet. Enabler.

Throw Force Shield: You can throw your Force Field Shield up to short
range as a light ranged weapon. Whether the shield hits or misses, it
immediately dissipates and then reforms in your grasp. Enabler.

Thrust (1 Might point): This is a powerful melee stab. You make an
attack and inflict 1 additional point of damage if your weapon has a
sharp edge or point. Action.

Thunder Beam (2 Might points): You direct a beam of focused sound at a
target within long range, inflicting 2 points of damage and inducing a
resonant destructive wave in their body. Each round after this initial
attack, you can make another roll for the destructive wave to inflict an
additional 1 point of damage to the target. If you fail this roll, the
destructive wave ends. Unlike the initial attack, the destructive wave
ignores Armor.

Alternatively, you can set up a destructive resonance in a physical
melee weapon for one minute or until you let go of it. All attacks made
with the target weapon inflict 1 additional point of damage.

Action to initiate.

Time Doppelganger (6+ Intellect points): A perfect copy of you appears
within an immediate distance. This doppelganger is probably a version of
you from another timeline or the past. The doppelganger is a level 5 NPC
with 15 health. It has your mind and memories, and you control it as if
it were you in another body. In effect, while this ability is active,
you have two bodies.

If the doppelganger uses any of your abilities that cost points, those
points come from your Pools (including spending Effort). Controlling two
bodies at once is difficult and distracting; while this ability is
active, all tasks performed by you or the doppelganger are hindered. The
doppelganger has no equipment other than simple clothing.

It remains for up to one minute, but disappears if killed or if you use
an action to dismiss it. If the doppelganger is killed, you take 5
points of damage that ignore Armor, and you lose your next action. If
you are killed while the doppelganger is present, you live on as the
doppelganger (it becomes your character instead of being an NPC that
disappears). In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can
choose to use Effort to increase the duration of this ability; each
level of Effort used in this way adds one minute to the doppelganger’s
existence.

If you also have this ability from another source, you may use either
ability, the doppelganger is 1 level higher, and it has 3 additional
health. Action.

Time Loop (4 Intellect points): You call yourself from a few moments in
the future to help you in the present. On the round you use this
ability, your future self appears anywhere you choose within immediate
range and takes an action. On the second round, you and your future self
both take actions, and your future self’s action is eased. On the third
round, you and your future self both disappear. On the fourth round, you
catch up to your future self, reappear wherever your future self
initially appeared in the first round, and can take your actions
normally.

Your future self shares your stats, so any damage that either of you
takes applies to the same stat Pools. If your future self is killed, you
and your future self disappear in the third round (as normal) and you
reappear, dead, in the fourth round. Neither you nor your future self
can use Time Loop again until you reappear as your future self in the
fourth round.

Action.

(In effect, Time Loop lets “you” take an action on the round you use it,
two actions on the second round, and zero actions on the third round,
and then you’re back to normal after that.)

Time Travel (10+ Intellect points): You and up to three willing
characters you choose within immediate range travel to a point in time
that you specify when you use this ability. The point in time must be
within ten years of the present. For each level of Effort applied, you
can travel ten more years or bring three more creatures with you. When
you appear in the new moment in time, you do so in the same position you
were in when you used this ability. Upon arriving at your temporal
destination, you and the other time travelers are stunned for one
minute. In order to return to your original time, you must use this
ability again. Action.

Tinker (1 Intellect point): You make a device do something different
from its original purpose. For example, a blaster becomes a bomb. A
scanner becomes a signal booster for a radio transmitter. A music player
becomes a battery for another device. The effective level of the
modified device is 1 lower than normal, and the device is rendered
unusable (for its original purpose) until repaired. Action to initiate.

Tiny: When you use Shrink, you can choose to shrink down to about
one-sixteenth of an inch (.2 cm). When you do, you add 5 more temporary
points to your Speed Pool (plus any from Smaller), and because your
attacks are concentrated into a very small area, you deal an additional
2 points of damage. For each level of Effort you apply to shrink even
more, you become one-tenth as tall (one one-hundredth for two levels of
Effort, one one-thousandth for three, and so on) and you add 1 more
point to your Speed Pool. Enabler.

In campaigns where characters can travel to parallel dimensions, using
Tiny to shrink to

one-thousandth of your normal height may be a means of doing so.

Tool Mastery: When you have an asset from using a tool, the time
required to perform the task is cut in half (minimum one round).
Enabler.

Total Awareness: You possess such a high level of awareness that it’s
very difficult to surprise, hide from, or sneak up on you. When you
apply a level of Effort to initiative and perception tasks, you gain two
free levels of Effort. Enabler.

Totally Chill: Your ten-minute recovery roll takes you only one round.
Enabler.

Tough As Nails: When you are impaired or debilitated on the damage
track, Might-based tasks and defense rolls you attempt are eased. If you
also have Ignore the Pain, make a difficulty 1 Might defense roll when
you reach 0 points in all three of your Pools to immediately regain 1
Might point and avoid dying. Each time you attempt to save yourself with
this ability before your next ten-hour recovery roll, the task is
hindered. Enabler. (A character can’t apply Effort or other abilities to
any task accomplished using Tough As Nails.)

Tough It Out: Working for a living has toughened you over time. You have
+1 to Armor against any kind of physical damage, even damage that
normally ignores Armor. Enabler.

Tower of Intellect: You are trained in Intellect defense tasks. If you
are already trained, you are specialized in those tasks instead.
Enabler.

Tower of Will: You are trained in Intellect defense tasks and gain +3
points to your Intellect Pool. Enabler.

Tracker: You are trained in following and identifying tracks. Enabler.

Trained Basher: You are trained in using the stone fists from your Golem
Body as a medium weapon. Enabler.

Trained Excavator: You are trained in perception, climbing, and
salvaging tasks. Enabler.

Trained Gunner: You can choose from one of two benefits. Either you are
trained in using guns, or you have the Spray ability (which costs 2
Speed points): If a weapon has the ability to fire rapid shots without
reloading (usually called a rapid-fire weapon, such as an automatic
pistol), you can spray multiple shots around your target to increase the
chance of hitting. This move uses 1d6 + 1 rounds of ammo (or all the
ammo in the weapon, if it has less than the number rolled). The attack
roll is eased. If the attack is successful, it deals 1 less point of
damage than normal. Enabler (being trained in using guns) or action
(Spray).

Trained Interlocutor: Through wit, charm, humor, and grace (or sometimes
rudeness, threatening posture, and obscenity), you’re better able to
talk others into what you want. You are trained in all interactions.
Enabler.

Trained Slayer: You are trained in using swords. Enabler.

Trained Swimmer: While underwater, you are trained in escaping,
perception, sneaking, and swimming tasks, as well as in tasks to
identify aquatic creatures and geography. Enabler.

Trained Without Armor: You are trained in Speed defense tasks when not
wearing armor. Enabler.

Transcend the Script (5 Intellect points): Whether they are lines you
wrote, acted, reported on, or otherwise incorporated into your talent,
you compose an oratory on the fly that is so wonderful that even you
believe it. For each ally who hears it (and you too), a task attempted
within the next hour is eased by two steps. Action.

Trapfinder (3+ Intellect points): You find any traps (like a floor that
would give way beneath you) or mechanical triggers to a trap or defense
system that might pose a threat. You can do this without setting them
off and in lieu of making a roll to find them. This ability can find
traps of level 4 or below. In addition to the normal options for using
Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the level of traps that
can be found by 2, so using two levels of Effort can find all traps of
level 8 or below. Action.

Trapster: You are trained in creating simple traps for human-sized or
smaller targets, especially many varieties of deadfalls and snares using
natural objects from the surrounding environment. When you lay a trap,
decide whether you want to hold the victim in place (a snare) or inflict
damage (a deadfall). Creating a snare is a difficulty 3 task, while the
difficulty of creating a deadfall is equal to the number of points of
damage you want it to inflict. For example, if you want to inflict 4
points of damage, that’s a difficulty 4 task (the training that comes
with this ability eases the task).

On a success, you create your one-use trap in about one minute, and it
is considered level 3 for the purposes of avoiding detection before it
is sprung and for a victim trying to struggle free (if a snare).

Action to initiate, one minute or one hour to complete.

Travel Skills: You are trained in two skills in which you are not
already trained. Choose two of the following: navigation, riding,
running, piloting, or vehicle driving. You can select this ability
multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different
skills. Enabler.

Traverse the Worlds (8+ Intellect points): You instantaneously transmit
yourself to another planet, dimension, plane, or level of reality. You
must know that the destination exists; the GM will decide if you have
enough information to confirm its existence and the level of difficulty
to reach the destination. In addition to the normal options for using
Effort, you can choose to use Effort to bring other people with you;
each level of Effort used in this way affects up to three additional
targets. You must touch any additional targets. Action.

Tree Companion (5+ Intellect points): You animate a tree of
approximately your size or smaller, creating a level 3 creature with 1
Armor. The tree follows your verbal commands for one hour, after which
it reverts to a normal tree (and roots itself where it stands). Unless
the tree is killed by damage, you can animate it again when the ability
duration expires, but any damage it has carries over to its newly
animated state. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you
can choose to use Effort to affect more trees; each level of Effort used
affects one additional tree. Action.

Tree Travel (4+ Intellect points): You enter one tree and
instantaneously and safely emerge from another one within long distance.
You don’t need to specify which tree you’re exiting from (if you know
there are trees in that direction, you can decide how far to go and you
will step out of a tree in that area). If the starting tree’s trunk
isn’t as large as your body, you must apply a level of Effort to enter
it. You can choose to use Effort to increase the distance you travel;
one level of Effort used in this way increases the range to very long,
two levels raise it to one mile (1.5 km), and each additional level of
Effort beyond that increases it by an additional mile. Action.

Trick Driver: While driving a car, truck, or motorcycle, your Might
Edge, Speed Edge, and Intellect Edge increase by 1. When you make a
recovery roll while driving, you recover 5 additional points. When you
attempt a driving task or an extreme trick—such as jumping a ravine or
other vehicle, spinning in the air, landing safely on another vehicle,
and so on—the task is eased. Enabler.

Trick Shot (2 Speed points): As part of the same action, you make a
ranged attack against two targets that are within immediate range of
each other. Make a separate attack roll against each target. The attack
rolls are hindered. Action.

True Defender (6 Might or Intellect points): This ability functions as
the Devoted Defender ability, except the benefit applies to up to three
characters you choose. If you choose just one character, you become
specialized in the tasks described under the Devoted Defender ability.
Action to initiate.

True Guardian (2 Might or Intellect points): When you stand guard as
your action, allies within immediate range of you gain an asset to their
defense tasks. This lasts until the end of your next turn. Enabler.

True Necromancy (8+ Intellect points): This ability works like the
Necromancy ability except that it creates a level 5 creature. Action to
animate.

True Senses: You can see in complete darkness up to 50 feet (15 m) as if
it were dim light. You recognize holograms, disguises, optical
illusions, sound mimicry, and other such tricks (for all senses) for
what they are. Enabler.

Trust to Luck (3 Intellect points): Sometimes, you’ve just got to roll
the dice and hope things add up in your favor. When you use Trust to
Luck, roll a d6. On any even result, the task you’re attempting is eased
by two steps. On a roll of 1, the task is hindered. Enabler.

Tumbling Moves (5 Speed points): When you use an action to move, Speed
defense rolls are eased until the end of your next turn. Enabler.

Twist of Fate: Experience has taught you a lot, including that sometimes
luck is something that you have to make for yourself. When you roll a 1,
you can reroll. You must use the new result, even if it’s another 1.
Enabler.

Twisting the Knife (4 Speed points): In a round after successfully
striking a foe with a melee weapon, you can opt to automatically deal
standard damage to the foe with that same weapon without any modifiers
(2 points for a light weapon, 4 points for a medium weapon, or 6 points
for a heavy weapon). Action.

Two Things at Once (6 Intellect points): The ultimate test: you divide
your attention and take two separate actions this round. Enabler.

Abilities—U

Ultra Enhancement: You gain +1 to Armor and +5 to each of your three
stat Pools. Enabler.

Unarmed Fighting Style: You are trained in unarmed attacks. Enabler.

Unarmored Fighter: While unarmored, you are trained in Speed defense
tasks. Enabler.

Uncanny Luck (4 Speed points): When you roll for a task and succeed,
roll again. If the second number rolled is higher than the first, you
get a minor effect. If you roll the same number again, you get a major
effect. If you have Uncanny Luck from another source or a similar
ability, it’s your choice (no roll required) whether you get a minor
effect, a major effect, or a free activation of one of your tier 1–3
focus abilities. Enabler.

Understanding (1 Intellect point): You observe or study a creature or
object. Your next interaction with that creature or object gains one
asset. Action.

Underworld Contacts: You know many people in a variety of communities
who engage in illegal activities. These people are not necessarily your
friends and might not be trustworthy, but they recognize you as a peer.
You and the GM should work out the details of your underworld contacts.
Enabler.

Undo (5 Intellect points): You turn back time a few seconds, effectively
undoing a single creature’s most recent action. That creature can then
immediately repeat the same action or try something different. Action.

Unexpected Betrayal: Within a round or two of successfully using
Enthrall, Fast Talk, or a similar ability on a target within short
range, the first attack you make on that target is eased by two steps.
Once you use Unexpected Betrayal on a target, using your abilities or
attempting simple persuasion on that target is permanently hindered by
two steps. Enabler.

Unmovable (3 Might points): You avoid being knocked down, pushed back,
or moved against your will as long as you are upright and able to take
actions. Enabler.

Unraveling Consumption: You can drain energy from a living creature by
touching it and concentrating for a minute or more. Each minute you
spend in contact with and concentrating on the creature deals it 1 point
of damage (ignores Armor) and restores 1 point to your Might or Speed
Pool. Because of the extended contact required for this ability,
normally you can use it only on a willing or helpless creature. If the
creature takes enough damage to knock it unconscious or kill it, it
crumbles into ash, dust, or some other inert material. Action to
initiate.

Untouchable (6 Intellect points): You change your phase state for the
next minute so that you can’t affect or be affected by normal matter or
energy. Only mental attacks and special transdimensional energies,
devices, or abilities can affect you, but likewise you can’t attack,
touch, or otherwise affect anything. Action to initiate.

Untouchable While Moving (4 Intellect points): You change your phase
state for the next minute so that you can’t affect or be affected by
normal matter or energy, as long as you move at least an immediate
distance each round while phased. If you don’t move on your turn, the
effect ends. While you are phased, only mental attacks and special
transdimensional energies, devices, or abilities can affect you, but
likewise you can’t attack, touch, or otherwise affect anything. Action
to initiate.

Up to Speed: If you do nothing but move for three actions in a row, you
accelerate greatly and can move up to 200 mph (about 2,000 feet each
round) for up to ten minutes (about 35 miles), after which you must stop
and make a recovery roll. (Move up to 322 kph \[about 600 m each round\]
for up to ten minutes \[about 56 km\].) Enabler.

Use Senses of Others (4 Intellect points): You can see, hear, smell,
touch, and taste through the senses of anyone with whom you have
telepathic contact by using Telepathic or similar abilities. You can
attempt to use this ability on a willing or unwilling target within long
range; an unwilling target can try to resist. You don’t need to see the
target, but you must know that it’s within range. Your shared senses
last ten minutes. Action to establish.

Using the Environment (4 Intellect points): You find some way to use the
environment to your advantage in a fight. For the next ten minutes,
attack rolls and Speed defense rolls are eased. Action to initiate.

Using What’s Available (4 Intellect points): If you have the time and
the freedom to scrounge for everyday materials in your environment, you
can fashion a temporary asset that will aid you once to accomplish a
specific task. For example, if you need to climb a wall, you could
create some sort of climbing assistance device; if you need to break out
of a cell, you can find something to use as a lockpick; if you need to
create a small distraction, you could put together something to make a
loud bang and flash; and so on. The asset lasts for a maximum of one
minute, or until used for the intended purpose. One minute to assemble
materials; action to create asset.

Usurp Cypher: Choose one cypher that you carry. The cypher must have an
effect that is not instantaneous. You destroy the cypher and gain its
power, which functions for you continuously. You can choose a cypher
when you gain this ability, or you can wait and make the choice later.
However, once you usurp a cypher’s power, you cannot later switch to a
different cypher—the usurping ability works only once. Action to
initiate.

Abilities—V

Vacuum Skilled: You are trained in two of the following skills: vacuum
welding, algae farming, ecosystem design, circuit design, spacecraft
maintenance and repair, or some similar skill related to traveling and
colonizing planets, moons, and stations located in the solar system.
Enabler.

Vanish (2 Intellect points): You become invisible for a short amount of
time. While invisible, you have an asset on stealth and Speed defense
tasks. The invisibility ends at the end of your next turn, or if you do
something to reveal your presence or position—attacking, using an
ability, moving a large object, and so on. Action.

Verbal Misdirection (2+ Intellect points): With fast talk and
bewildering words, you can confuse and distract anyone that you’re
speaking with, giving you an asset on social interactions with that
person for ten minutes. In addition to the normal options for using
Effort, you can choose to use Effort to affect additional creatures (one
per level of Effort). Enabler.

Versatile Mind: When you make a Speed defense roll, you can use your
Intellect in place of your Speed. Enabler.

Very Long Sprinting: When you use Phase Sprint, you can travel up to a
very long distance as your action instead of a long distance. Enabler.

Vigilance (2 Intellect points): You take a cautious approach to combat,
focusing more on protecting yourself than on hurting your opponents.
While this ability is active, you gain an asset on Speed defense rolls
against melee and ranged attacks, and your melee and ranged attacks are
hindered. This effect lasts for as long as you wish, but it ends if no
combat is taking place within range of your senses. Action to initiate.

Vigilant (5 Might points): When affected by an attack or effect that
would daze or stun you, you are not dazed or stunned. Enabler.

Vindictive Performance (5 Intellect points): When you tell a joke,
perform a song or poem, draw a picture, relate an anecdote, or otherwise
provide entertainment, you can select one individual from the audience
who is able to understand you. During your performance, you heap
indirect but biting derision on this target. If you succeed, the target
doesn’t realize that they’ve become the victim of your performance until
you wrap up the entertainment at a moment you choose in a way that
strikes home. The target suffers 6 points of Intellect damage (ignores
Armor) and loses their next turn. One or more actions to initiate.

Void Wings (3 Intellect points): Swirling ribbons of weird matter grasp
you and lift you up, allowing you to fly for one round as quickly as you
can move. Enabler.

Abilities—W

Walk Through Walls (2 Intellect points): You can slowly pass through
physical barriers at a rate of 1 inch (2.5 cm) per round (minimum of one
round to pass through any barrier). You can’t act (other than moving) or
perceive anything until you pass entirely through the barrier. You can’t
pass through energy barriers. Action.

Wall of Lightning (6 Intellect points): You create a barrier of
crackling electricity up to 2,500 square feet (230 sq. m) in size,
shaped as you wish. The wall is a level 7 barrier. Anyone within
immediate distance of the wall automatically takes 10 points of damage.
The wall lasts for one hour. Action to create.

Wall With Teeth: You inflict 2 additional points of damage with all
attacks when using your Living Wall ability. Enabler.

War Flesh: You can instantly transform your hands and feet into claws,
and your human teeth into fangs, or revert to your normal human
appearance. When you make attacks with your claws or fangs, they count
as medium weapons instead of light weapons. Enabler.

Ward: You have a shield of energy around you at all times that helps
deflect attacks. You gain +1 to Armor. Enabler.

Warding Shield: You have +1 to Armor while you are using a shield.
Enabler.

Water Adaptation: You can breathe water as easily as you breathe air.
Enabler.

Weapon and Body (5 Speed points): After making a melee weapon or ranged
weapon attack, you follow up with a punch or kick as an additional
attack, all as part of the same action in one round. The two attacks can
be directed at different foes. Make a separate attack roll for each
attack. You remain limited by the amount of Effort you can apply on one
action. Anything that modifies your attack or damage applies to both
attacks, unless it is tied specifically to your weapon. Action.

Weapon Crafter: You are trained in crafting tasks associated with your
chosen weapon. For instance, if your weapon is a bow, you are trained in
tasks related to crafting bows and fletching arrows; if your weapon is a
sword, you are trained in tasks for forging swords and sharpening
blades; and so on. Enabler.

Weapon Defense: While your chosen weapon is in your hand(s), you are
trained in Speed defense rolls. Enabler.

Weapon Master: You inflict an additional 1 point of damage with your
chosen weapon. Enabler.

Weaponization: One light or medium melee weapon of your choice is built
into your body, and you are trained in using it. The weapon is concealed
until you wish to use it. Enabler.

Wear It Well: When you wear armor of any kind, you gain an additional +1
to Armor. Enabler.

Weather the Vicissitudes: Helping your friends means being able to stand
up to everything the world throws at you. You have +1 to Armor. Also,
you resist heat, cold, and similar extremes and have an additional +1 to
Armor against ambient damage or other damage that would normally ignore
Armor. Enabler.

Weight of the World (6+ Intellect points): You can increase a target’s
weight dramatically. The target is pulled to the ground and can’t move
physically under its own power for one minute. The target must be within
short range. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can
choose to use Effort to affect additional creatures (one per level of
Effort). Action.

Weightless Shot: You have a sixth sense when it comes to lining up
trajectories and moving in low-gravity and zero-gravity environments,
which also translates to making ranged attacks. When you hit a target
with a ranged attack in microgravity conditions, you can choose to
reduce the damage by 2 points but hit the target in a precise spot. Some
of the possible effects include (but are not limited to) the following:

You punch a hole in the target’s suit, so it begins to leak air into the
vacuum slowly, or all at once (your choice).

You hit the reaction mass of the target’s maneuvering pack, which means
the target can no longer change their trajectory, or they go spinning
off in a random direction (your choice).

You can shoot a spacecraft, and degrade one ship system by one step
(systems include engines, weapons, and atmosphere).

Enabler.

Weighty (1 Intellect point): You briefly increase the weight of a target
within short range enough to stop them in their tracks, preventing the
target from moving and hindering any attempted tasks on their next turn.
Action.

Weird Science Breakthrough (5+ Intellect points): Your research leads to
a breakthrough, and you imbue an object with a truly amazing property,
though you can use the item only once. To do so, you must buy spare
parts equivalent to an expensive item, have a field science kit (or a
permanent lab, if you have access to one), and succeed at a difficulty 4
Intellect-based roll to create a random manifest cypher of up to level
2. The GM decides the nature of the cypher you create. Attempting to
create a specified cypher hinders the task by two steps. Creating a
cypher does not allow you to surpass your normal cypher limit. In
addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use
Effort to increase the level of the cypher you create; each level of
Effort increases the level of the cypher and the difficulty of the
Intellect task to create it. Action to initiate, one hour to complete.

Whirlwind of Throws (5 Speed points): With a large handful of small
objects—tiny knives, shuriken, stones, jagged bits of metal, coins, or
whatever is on hand—you attack every creature in an immediate area
within short range. You must make attack rolls against each target. Each
attack is hindered. You inflict 3 points of damage on targets you hit.
Action.

Wild Camouflage (4 Intellect points): By drawing your clothing about you
just so and using various tricks and your deep knowledge of your
surroundings, you become invisible in the wilderness for ten minutes.
While you are invisible, this asset eases your stealth and Speed defense
tasks by two steps. This effect ends if you do something to reveal your
presence or position—attacking, using an ability, moving a large object,
and so on. If this occurs, you can regain the remaining invisibility
effect by taking an action to focus on hiding your position. Action to
initiate or reinitiate.

The Wild Is on Your Side (5 Intellect points): While you’re in the
wilderness, foes within short range are tripped by rocks, tangled in
vines, bitten by insects, and distracted or confused by small animals,
which hinders all their tasks for ten minutes. Action to initiate.

Wild Insight: You gain a momentary perfect understanding of the flow of
magic around you at this moment. When preparing your magic, choose one
specific subtle cypher and make a magical lore skill roll against level
6. If you succeed, you gain that subtle cypher (the cypher’s level is
6); if you fail, you get a random subtle cypher. If you aren’t sure what
specific subtle cypher you want, you can ask for a broad category such
as “healing,” “movement,” or “skill”; this eases the magical lore task,
and if you succeed, the GM chooses a random cypher that fits that
category. You can’t use this ability again until after you’ve taken a
ten-hour recovery action. Enabler.

Wild Vitality (4 Intellect points): You attune with the life force of a
natural creature (your size or bigger) within long range that you can
see. This is a level 2 Intellect task. If you succeed, the creature is
not harmed, but through resonance with its wild vitality, you gain
several benefits for up to one minute: an asset to all your Might-based
tasks (including attacks and defenses), +2 to your Might Edge and Speed
Edge, and 2 additional points of damage on all successful melee attacks.
Action to initiate.

Wildcard Powers: You have a gift with using copied powers in unusual
ways. Whenever you try a power stunt and use a level of Effort on the
special roll to modify the ability, you get a free level of Effort on
that roll. Enabler.

Wilderness Awareness (4 Intellect points): Your connection to the
natural world extends to a degree that some would call supernatural.
While in the wilderness, you can extend your senses up to a mile in any
direction and ask the GM a very simple, general question about that
area, such as “Where is the orc camp?” or “Is my friend Deithan still
alive?” If the answer you seek is not in the area, you receive no
information. Action.

Wilderness Encouragement (3 Intellect points): While in the wilderness,
or when talking about your time in the wilderness, your stirring words
of encouragement grant a target within short range that can understand
you 1d6 points to one Pool. You can’t use this ability on the same
creature again until they’ve made a recovery roll. Action.

Wilderness Explorer: While taking any action (including fighting) in the
wild, you ignore any penalties due to natural causes such as tall grass,
thick brush, rugged terrain, weather, and so on. Enabler.

Wilderness Life: You are trained in two of the following: climbing,
swimming, navigation, or identifying plants and creatures. Enabler.

Wilderness Lore: You are trained in wilderness navigation and in
identifying plants and creatures. Enabler.

Will of a Leader (9 Intellect points): You harden your allies’
dedication and capabilities. Each ally within immediate range gains +1
Edge to one stat of their choice for one hour. You also gain this
benefit to one stat of your choice. Action.

Will of Legend: You are immune to attacks that would captivate,
mesmerize, charm, or otherwise influence your mind. Enabler.

Willing Sacrifice: When you take an attack meant for another character,
you know how to take the attack in a way that minimizes its effect. The
attack automatically strikes you, but instead of taking 1 additional
point of damage, you take 1 less point of damage (to a minimum of 1
point). Additionally, you can take more than one attack in a given round
provided that all the attacks were originally meant for one target.
Enabler. (Two characters attempting to draw an attack at the same time
cancel each other out.)

Wind Armor (1 Intellect point): When you wish it, a cyclone of wind
surrounds your body for ten minutes, giving you +1 to Armor and an
additional +2 to Armor against physical projectile weapons specifically.
While the cyclone is active, you feel no discomfort from the wind, and
you can interact with other creatures and objects normally because the
wind flow automatically diverts to enable such interaction. Enabler.

Wind Chariot (7+ Intellect points): You summon winds that pick you up
and allow you to fly for up to a long distance each round in combat or
with an overland speed of up to 200 miles per hour (320 kph) for up to
ten hours. For each level of Effort you apply, you can bring one ally of
about your size with you through the air or increase the duration of the
effect by one hour. Action to initiate.

Windrider (4+ Intellect points): You summon winds that pick you up and
allow you to fly for one minute at a rate of up to a long distance each
round. For each level of Effort you apply, you can carry one ally of
about your size with you through the air or increase the duration of the
effect by one minute. Action to initiate.

Windwracked Traveler (4+ Intellect points): You condense a wide wing of
dark matter that can carry you through the air for a period of up to one
hour. For each level of Effort applied, you can add one hour to the
duration or carry one additional creature of your size or smaller. You
must touch the additional creatures for them to be tucked under your
wing. They must remain relatively still while the wing lasts or they
will fall. In terms of overland movement, you fly at about 20 miles (32
km) per hour and are not affected by terrain. Action to initiate.

Wings of Fire (4 Intellect points): While your Shroud of Flame is
active, you can spread wings of fire and can levitate, moving at a rate
of up to 20 feet (6 m) per round in any direction for one minute. You
can also take one other  
non-movement action on your turn. Action.

Wing Weapons: You can use your wings to make melee attacks (even when
flying), leaving your hands and feet free. Your wings are medium bashing
or bladed weapons (your choice). You are practiced with this attack.
Enabler.

Winter Gauntlets: When you use Frost Touch, you inflict an additional 3
points of damage if you touch a creature, or an additional 2 points of
damage if you infuse a weapon. In addition, damaged targets are frozen
in place (if standing on a solid surface) and can’t move from their
location until they use an action to break free. The target can still
attack and defend. Action for touch; enabler for weapon.

Wooden Body (1+ Might points): You transform your body into living wood
for ten minutes, which grants you several benefits. You gain +1 to Armor
and you are practiced in using your limbs as medium weapons. You need
about one-tenth as much air as a human. Hiding among trees or on a tree
is eased. However, in your wooden form you move more stiffly than a
creature of flesh, hindering your Speed defense rolls. Action to change
or revert.

Your wooden body might be smooth like a polished board, rough like tree
bark, or a mix of both.

Word of Command (6 Intellect points + level 6 cypher): You utter a word
so powerful that to fully invest it, you sacrifice a cypher in your
possession that is level 6 or higher. You issue the word to one creature
within long range that you can see. The affected target must obey the
command for several hours before it is free to act as it wishes. Targets
that are attacked while under the effect of the command can defend
themselves. Typical commands include “retreat,” “calm,” “come,” and
“stay.” The GM decides how the target acts once a command is given.
Action.

Word of Death (5+ Intellect points): Your attack is the utterance of a
magic word so terrible that it snuffs the life from a living target
within short range. The target must be level 1. In addition to the
normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to
increase the maximum level of the target. Thus, to kill a level 5 target
(four levels above the normal limit), you must apply four levels of
Effort. Action.

Work the Friendship (4 Intellect points): You know just what to say to
draw a little extra effort from an ally. This grants one creature you
choose within short range an additional, immediate action, which it can
take out of turn. The creature uses the additional action however it
wishes. Action.

Wormhole (6 Intellect points): You create a doorway through time and
space. The shortcut manifests as a hole in reality large enough to
accommodate you and creatures of your size or smaller. One side of the
doorway appears anywhere within immediate range, and the other side
opens at a spot you choose anywhere within long range. Any character or
object moving into one side exits from the other. The door remains open
for one minute or until you use an action to close it. Action to
initiate.

Wound Tender: You are trained in healing. Enabler.

Wraith Cloak: At your command, the spirit from your Spirit Accomplice
ability wraps itself around you for up to ten minutes. The spirit
automatically inflicts 4 points of damage to anyone who tries to touch
you or strike you with a melee attack. While the wraith cloak is active,
all tasks to evade the perceptions of others are eased. Enabler.

Wreck: Using two hands, you wield a weapon or a tool with a powerful
swing. (If fighting unarmed, this attack is made with both fists or both
feet together.) When using this as an attack, you take a –1 penalty to
the attack roll, and you inflict 3 additional points of damage. When
attempting to damage an object or barrier, you are trained in the task.
Action.

Wrest From Chance: If you roll a natural 1 on a d20, you can reroll the
die. If you reroll, you avoid a GM intrusion—unless you roll a second
1—and might succeed on your task. Once you use this ability, it is not
available again until after you make a ten-hour recovery roll. Enabler.

Abilities—Y

You Studied: To be able to put two and two together to reach a
deduction, you have to know a few things. You are trained in two areas
of knowledge of your choosing (as long as they are not physical actions
or combat related) or specialized in one area. Enabler.

Abilities—Z

Zero Dark Eyes: Some people’s eyes are degraded by constantly playing
games. And maybe that’ll happen to you, but not yet. You’re still young
and instead of degrading, your vision is actually better thanks to all
your practice. You can see in very dim light as though it were bright
light. You can see in total darkness as if it were very dim light.
Enabler.

Equipment

Equipment in the Cypher System plays only a small role. It’s far more
important to focus on what you can do than on what you have. Still,
sometimes it’s important to know if you’ve got enough rope, or what kind
of gun your space pilot has at their hip.

Aquatic: The animal either breathes water instead of air or is able to
breathe water in addition to breathing air.

Armor: The animal has a thick hide or shell, granting +1 to Armor.

Constrict: The animal can grip its opponent fast after making a melee
attack (usually with a bite or claw), easing attack rolls against that
foe on later turns until the animal releases the foe.

Fast: The animal can move a long distance on its turn instead of a short
distance.

Flying: The animal can fly, which (depending on the type of animal) may
be up to a short or long distance on its turn.

Hands: The animal has paws or hands that are nearly as agile as those of
a human. Unlike with most animal shapes, the animal’s tasks that require
hands are not hindered (although the GM may decide that some tasks
requiring human agility, such as playing a flute, are still hindered).

Scent: The animal has a strong sense of smell, gaining an asset on
tracking and dealing with darkness or blindness.

Small: The animal is considerably smaller than a human, easing its Speed
defense tasks but hindering tasks to move heavy things.

Venom: The animal is poisonous (usually through a bite), inflicting 1
additional point of damage.

CURRENCY AND PRICES

Dollars, pounds, euros, credits, gold pieces, Martian solval beads,
Corso moons and stars, bottle caps—a lot of different currencies might
be used in your game, depending on the setting and the genre. You should
use whatever you like. In the Cypher System rules, we talk in
generalities rather than specifics. Not unlike saying immediate or short
distance rather than giving precise numbers, we talk about goods and
services in terms of inexpensive, moderately priced, expensive, very
expensive, or exorbitant.

The GM can figure out what those things mean in their setting. In a
fantasy setting, an inexpensive item might be 1 or 2 copper pennies,
while an expensive item might require gold on the table. The exact
amount can vary, and in many campaigns, the exact amount will matter.
The GM will develop a detailed price list for their setting, and players
will track their money on their character sheets to determine what they
can afford, often ignoring the terms inexpensive, moderately priced, and
so on.

But some GMs might want to keep things simple and use only the general
terms, indicating currency just as flavor now and then. In a space opera
game, where the PCs are the crew of a starship blazing about the galaxy
in search of adventure and profit, fuel and upkeep for the ship might be
expensive. Hauling a few passengers from Epsilon Eridani back to Earth
might earn enough to purchase six expensive items but cost the
equivalent of two expensive items, leaving the crew with the means to
refuel and maintain the ship for two further voyages. In such a game,
where money only means keeping the ship flying, no one has to talk in
specific amounts. Characters might refer to “galactic credits” or
something similar, but amounts might not be tracked on the character
sheets.

PRICE CATEGORIES

There are five price categories for goods and services.

An inexpensive item is something that common people buy. A simple meal
or a drink in the bar. A pen and some paper. A book or magazine.

A moderately priced item is something that common people buy, but not
too often and not in great quantities. A small piece of furniture. A
major entertainment. An expensive meal. A new outfit.

An expensive item is something that would strain a common person’s
finances. Rent on a simple apartment. A major piece of furniture. A very
nice outfit. The cost to travel a long distance (if appropriate to the
setting).

A very expensive item is probably out of the reach of most people except
in very special circumstances. Jewelry. Luxury furnishings.

An exorbitant item is something only the very rich can afford. A very
nice house. A ship. Extremely expensive jewelry or art.

Think of the categories as powers of 10. That is to say, a moderately
priced item is ten times more costly than an inexpensive item. An
expensive item is ten times more costly than a moderately priced item,
and thus 100 times the cost of something inexpensive. A very expensive
item is ten times the cost of an expensive one, 100 times the cost of a
moderate one, and 1,000 times the cost of an inexpensive one. An
exorbitant item is priced ten times beyond that.

(In some settings, even the generalization offered by the pricing
categories might be too specific or cumbersome. In many superhero games,
for example, prices are relatively moot. After saving the city, typical
superheroes don’t worry about paying rent or how much dinner will cost.
On the other hand, in a grittier superhero game, maybe that’s exactly
what they worry about.)

USING THE PRICE CATEGORIES

Regardless of how precise you want to be with prices and currency, you
can use the price categories in a variety of ways.

It’s easy for a GM to say to a player “You can afford two extra
moderately priced things at the start of the game.” The player can look
on the list and pick two moderately priced items without worrying about
their cost. Plus, this approach makes it clear that they get two items,
not twenty inexpensive items or one more expensive item that perhaps
would not be appropriate for a starting character. The categories make
it easy to lump similar items together.

The GM can also say “You can have whatever inexpensive items you want,
and don’t worry about the cost.” At higher tiers, when the PCs have more
wealth, followers, and so on, the GM can do this with moderate or even
expensive items. This allows the group to skip over playing through a
shopping trip to get supplies, and players don’t have to track prices
down to the last coin.

Finally, the categories can be shorthand when evaluating loot, dividing
up the spoils among the PCs, and resolving other story-based occurrences
that crop up in the game without dealing in the minutiae of exact
prices. This is of particular use in high-powered games where the PCs
are rich and powerful.

Level of Equipment

Mundane equipment is about level 4—less if of inferior quality or
materials, more if of superior quality or materials. This means that in
a setting based on the distant past, the default level might be 3, while
in the future it might be 5 or 6. So an average serf ’s tool in the Dark
Ages is level 3, easily broken, while an average tool on a space station
is level 6, made of advanced polymers.

ARMOR

Characters expecting danger frequently wear armor. Even the simplest
protective covering helps against stabs and cuts, and more sophisticated
or heavier armor protects against graver threats.

You can wear only one type of armor at a time—you cannot wear chainmail
hauberk and scale armor together, for example. However, Armor bonuses
from multiple sources combine to provide a total Armor rating. For
example, if you have subdermal implants that give you +1 to Armor, a
force field that offers another +1 to Armor, and beastskin that grants
+2 to Armor, you have a total of +4 to Armor.

In general, light armor is a moderately priced item, medium armor is
expensive, and heavy armor is very expensive. The Genre chapter offers
more specific details on the kinds of armor available in a given
setting. Keep in mind that in many genres, it’s quite odd, at best, to
run around in armor tougher than a leather jacket.

USING ARMOR

Anyone can wear any armor, but it can be taxing. Wearing armor increases
the cost of using a level of Effort when attempting a Speed-based
action. So if you’re wearing light armor and want to use two levels of
Effort on a Speed-based roll to run across difficult terrain, it costs 7
points from your Speed Pool rather than 5 (3 for the first level of
Effort, plus 2 for the second level of Effort, plus 1 per level for
wearing light armor). Edge reduces the overall cost as normal. If you
are not experienced with a certain type of armor but wear it anyway,
this cost is further increased by 1. Having experience with a type of
armor is called being practiced with the armor.

FANTASY ARMOR DESCRIPTIONS

You can wear only one kind of armor at a time (wearing more than one
only gives the Armor from the best one and the Speed Effort cost of the
worst one). 

Beastskin: An improved form of hides and furs, usually crafted from a
creature with especially tough skin such as a giant lizard or
rhinoceros.

Breastplate: A fitted metal plate or set of plates that protect your
torso but not your arms or legs, giving you greater movement than full
plate at the cost of some protection. 

Brigandine: Long strips of metal attached to a cloth or leather backing.
Often called “splint mail.” 

Chainmail: Mail armor made from hundreds of interlocking metal rings or
links. Often called “chain” or “chain armor.” 

Dwarven breastplate: A high-quality breastplate crafted by a skilled
dwarf, providing good protection and great mobility. Dwarven breastplate
is medium armor (2 Armor) but encumbers the wearer as if it were light
armor (it has a Speed Effort cost of 1). Not all dwarf-crafted
breastplates count as this type of armor (only exceptionally skilled
dwarven smiths know how to make it). 

Elven chainmail: A high-quality suit of chainmail crafted by a skilled
elf, providing good protection and excellent mobility. Elven chainmail
is medium armor (2 Armor) but is no more encumbering than a typical
outfit of normal clothing (it has no Speed Effort cost). Not all
elf-crafted chainmail counts as this type of armor (only exceptionally
skilled elven smiths know how to make it). 

Full plate: A complete suit of fitted metal plates that give excellent
coverage and protection against attacks. The joints are protected by
small layered plates over flexible chain. Sometimes called “plate
mail.” 

Heavy cloth: Clothing that’s heavy enough to reduce the effect of
attacks against you, such as winter clothing or a fashionable leather
outfit. Heavy cloth provides 1 Armor against piercing or slashing
attacks like arrows and swords, but not bashing attacks like clubs or
hammers. Heavy cloth doesn’t have a Speed Effort cost. It can’t be worn
with other kinds of armor. 

Hides and furs: Made from thick or poorly cured animal skins. It’s
heavier and bulkier than other kinds of leather armor, but easier to
make, especially by resource-poor crafters. 

Leather jerkin: Armor made of hardened pieces of leather (usually boiled
or treated with chemicals) that mainly covers your torso. It’s stiffer
than leather used for clothing, but still flexible enough that you can
bend and twist in it. Some jerkins are reinforced with metal studs (and
may be called “studded leather”), and brigandine improves upon that
concept. 

Padded: Cloth armor that is deliberately designed with multiple layers
to be thick and protective. This is sometimes called “quilted armor”
because it is a layer of padding sewn between two layers of cloth.
Padded armor provides 1 Armor against piercing or slashing attacks like
arrows and swords, but not bashing attacks like clubs or hammers. Padded
armor doesn’t have a Speed Effort cost. It can’t be worn with other
kinds of armor.

Scale: Mail armor made from overlapping scales or plates attached to a
leather or cloth backing. Often called “scale mail.” 

Shield: Provides an asset to Speed defense. Shield sizes vary from a
small buckler to a large kite shield (in the Cypher System, the
difference is mainly flavor, and for game purposes they all grant the
wearer the same benefit).

\*\* Using a shield provides the wearer with an asset on Speed defense
tasks

If the GM prefers the simpler method of not tracking whether an attack
is bashing, slashing, or stabbing, heavy cloth and padded armor should
provide no Armor at all.

Shields

Shields provide an asset to Speed defense rolls. You must have one free
hand to use a shield.

WEAPONS

Not all characters are familiar with all weapons. Warriors know their
way around most types, but Explorers prefer light or medium weapons, and
Adepts and Speakers usually stick to light weapons. If you wield a
weapon that you have no experience with, an attack with that weapon is
hindered. Having experience with a weapon is called being practiced with
the weapon.

Light weapons inflict only 2 points of damage, but attacks with them are
eased because they are fast and easy to use. Light weapons are punches,
kicks, knives, handaxes, darts, very small pistols, and so on. Weapons
that are particularly small are light weapons.

Medium weapons inflict 4 points of damage. Medium weapons include
broadswords, battleaxes, maces, crossbows, spears, typical handguns,
light rifles, sawed-off shotguns, and so on. Most weapons are medium.
Anything that could be used in one hand (even if it’s often used in two
hands, such as a quarterstaff or spear) is a medium weapon.

Heavy weapons inflict 6 points of damage, and you must use two hands to
attack with them. Heavy weapons are huge swords, great hammers, massive
axes, halberds, heavy crossbows, rifles, regular shotguns, assault
rifles, and so on. Anything that must be used in two hands is a heavy
weapon.

|        |                         |
|--------|-------------------------|
| Weapon | Damage                  |
| Light  | 2 points (attack eased) |
| Medium | 4 points                |
| Heavy  | 6 points                |

In general, light weapons are moderately priced items, medium weapons
are expensive, and heavy weapons are very expensive. Ammunition for a
ranged weapon is inexpensive. The Genre chapter offers more specific
details on weapons available in a given setting. Keep in mind that in
many genres, it’s not acceptable to run around carrying dangerous
weapons.

FANTASY WEAPONS DESCRIPTIONS

EXPLOSIVE WEAPONS

Bombs, grenades, missiles, and other explosives operate differently than
other weapons. They affect all targets within an area (usually an
immediate area) and inflict damage to all of them. A separate attack
roll is required for each (or a Speed defense roll if the PCs are the
targets of such an attack), although to simplify, the player can make
one attack roll and compare it to the difficulty to attack each target.
Usually, even if the attack roll fails (or the Speed defense roll
succeeds), the targets still suffer a smaller amount of damage, often 1
point.

Explosives like grenades can be thrown a short distance. Otherwise,
another launcher weapon is needed to project them a long distance (or
farther).

Adventuring equipment DESCRIPTIONS

Acid: A flask of strong acid. Can be thrown up to short range,
inflicting acid damage as a light weapon (ignores Armor). If poured
carefully, it can damage or destroy a small item or areas made of stone
or metal. 

Adventuring pack: Includes 50 feet (15 m) of rope, three days’ iron
rations, three spikes, small hammer, a set of warm clothes, boots, and
three torches. 

Alchemist fire: A flask of chemicals that burst into flames upon contact
with air. The flames burn out after one round. Can be thrown up to short
range, inflicting fire damage as a light weapon (ignores Armor). 

Alchemist tools: A sturdy wooden case with tiny flasks, stirring rods,
droppers, and other materials used in alchemy. It grants an asset for
identifying potion cyphers and similar mysterious liquids. 

Bag of heavy tools: Contains a hammer, six spikes, crowbar, large tongs,
chisel, and 10 feet (3 m) of strong rope. 

Bag of light tools: Contains a small hammer, small tongs, pliers, small
pry bar, awl, lockpicks, 10 feet (3 m) of string, 3 feet (1 m) of metal
wire, and a handful of nails. 

Battering ram: This sturdy plank is capped with hard metal. It provides
an asset for breaking down doors. 

Book: A book with information on a particular topic, such as geography,
history, magic, or religion. Provides an asset on appropriate rolls if
the character reads or skims the book for at least ten minutes before
attempting the task (this assumes the character has already read the
book and is looking for relevant information). 

Caltrops, bag: A bag of hard things you scatter on the ground to slow or
injure anyone walking through an area. One bag covers an immediate area
and makes that area count as difficult terrain. A creature can safely
move through it as if it were difficult terrain (half speed). If a
creature moves through the area at normal speed, they must make a
difficulty 2 Speed defense roll or take 2 points of Speed damage
(ignores Armor).

Candle: A candle burns for one hour and creates dim light in an
immediate area. 

Climbing kit: A set of crampons, pitons, ropes, and tools. Provides an
asset on climbing tasks. 

Crowbar: This bent length of metal grants an asset on tasks to open
doors, treasure chests, and similar objects. 

Disguise kit: Makeup, simple prosthetics, and a wig or two, suitable for
disguises for a theatrical production. Provides an asset on disguise
tasks. Some parts are reusable, but the kit runs out after about five
uses. 

Healing kit: A collection of bandages, needles, thread, and basic
medicines. Provides an asset on healing tasks. Some parts are reusable,
but the kit runs out after about five uses. 

Lamp: A hollow container filled with oil that slowly burns to provide
light (often resembling a “genie lamp”). A lamp creates normal light in
an immediate area and dim light out to the short area beyond that. It
burns for three to four hours on 1 pint (.5 L) of oil. If dropped, it
might spill oil, break, or both. 

Lantern: An improved version of a lamp, with a wick that draws oil and
glass or metal panes to protect it from wind. A lantern creates normal
light in an immediate area and dim light out to the short area beyond
that. It burns for three to four hours on 1 pint (.5 L) of oil. If
dropped, it is less likely to spill than a lamp.

Lockpicks: Also known as thieves’ tools, this set provides everything a
skilled person needs to pick locks and disarm traps. 

Manacles: Metal or heavy wooden restraints that hold an enemy’s wrists
or ankles in place and are secured with a pin. A common set of manacles
is level 5. 

Oil: A pint (.5 L) of lamp oil in a leather flask. It burns for three to
four hours in a lantern or lamp. If prepped with a burning wick, it can
be thrown, inflicting fire damage as a light weapon (ignores Armor). If
poured on a flat surface, it makes an immediate area slippery. A
creature can safely move through the oil slick as if it were difficult
terrain (half speed). If a creature moves through the area at normal
speed, they must make a difficulty 3 Speed defense roll or slip on the
oil and fall prone. Lighting the oil slick makes it burn for one or two
rounds and inflicts 1 point of fire damage (ignores Armor) on anyone in
or moving through the area. 

Signal horn: This horn can be heard up to a mile away. 

Spyglass: This device grants an asset on perception tasks to see things
at long range or longer. 

Tent: This has enough room for two humans or three smaller people. 

Torch: A wooden stick with some kind of fuel on one end (such as burlap
and wax). It burns for one hour, creating normal light in an immediate
area and dim light in the short area beyond that. A torch is fragile and
usually breaks if used to hit something

Miscellaneous Items and Services

Although the types of items for sale vary greatly based on the setting,
a few things are always present, like food, lodging, and clothing.
However, these goods and services can span the price categories. For
example, you can get an inexpensive meal, a moderately priced meal, an
expensive meal, and so on. An inexpensive meal is light and probably not
very nutritious. An expensive meal is available only in nice restaurants
in certain locations. An exorbitant meal is probably a feast for a
crowd, with the finest foods and drink available.

Nightly lodging is similar, although the bottom end starts out worse. An
inexpensive night’s lodging is probably a flea-ridden mat on the floor
of a room filled with other lodgers. Typical lodging (a private room
with a decent bed) is probably in the moderately priced range. Very
expensive lodging might be a suite of rooms with delicious meals and
personal services (such as massages and grooming) included.

Inexpensive clothing is just a step up from rags, but moderately priced
clothing is decent enough. For a formal party, you’d want expensive
clothing. The very rich likely wear very expensive clothing most of the
time, and exorbitant clothing (and jewelry) when they go to their elite
galas.

Other sorts of miscellaneous items can be found in the Genre chapter.

Fantasy clothing descriptions

Specific pieces of clothing vary by climate and local custom, but
usually include a hat, shirt, belt, pants or skirt, shoes, and
underclothes. 

Artisan’s outfit: A suitable outfit for a person who performs a trade
(blacksmith, cobbler, and so on). Often includes an apron and a belt for
holding tools. 

Ascetic’s outfit: A simple outfit worn by monks and other people who
eschew displays of wealth and status. Specific styles vary by climate
and the philosophical tenets of the wearer, but a typical example is a
loose shirt, loose breeches, sandals, a cap, and several cloth straps
that can serve as a belt, scarf, or simple adornments. 

Cold-weather outfit: A heavier set of clothing for protection against
cold weather. 

Entertainer’s costume: Interesting (and usually colorful) clothing
appropriate for an entertainer such as an actor, bard, juggler, or
acrobat.

Explorer’s outfit: A set of sturdy clothing for adventurers and
experienced travelers who want to be prepared for various activities and
environments. 

Fancy outfit: A stylish set of clothes according to the local fashions
and customs. Generally the minimum required for meeting with important
townsfolk such as a mayor or noble. Higher-status events require outfits
that cost up to four times as much. 

Peasant’s outfit: Very simple clothing for free people of low social
status. Includes a kerchief or cap, shirt or blouse, trousers or skirt,
and heavy cloth shoes or foot wrappings. 

Priestly vestments: Garments appropriate for performing ceremonies for a
specific religion. A common example is a hat or headdress, long tunic or
dress, tabard or stole, and shoes, with the outer pieces marked with
appropriate symbols. 

Traveler’s outfit: A comfortable set of clothes that includes gloves, a
protective hat, a jacket, and a cloak with a hood. 

Wizard’s outfit: Clothing that identifies the wearer as a practitioner
of arcane magic. A typical outfit includes an interesting hat or cap, a
robe with long sleeves and many pockets, and shoes, often adorned with
runes or representations of magical creatures such as dragons. Scholars
and sages wear very similar garments that lack the mystical aspects of
wizard clothing.

or patrolling an area against thieves and intruders than it is for
accompanying adventurers into dangerous locations. 

Pony: A smaller type of horse, suitable for pulling a cart, carrying
smaller loads than a full-sized horse, or serving as a mount for a
smaller-than-human creature such as a dwarf or halfling. 

Riding horse: A horse trained for riding and able to carry a typical
adult human. Riding horses tend to panic in combat. 

Warhorse: A horse trained to be calm during the noise and action of
combat, used either as a mount or to pull a vehicle such as a chariot.

CYPHERS

Cyphers can sometimes be physical items like equipment, but they work
very differently. To be entirely accurate, cyphers might have the veneer
of equipment, but don’t fall into the trap of confusing the two. Cyphers
are far more akin to PC special abilities than to gear. In a fantasy
game, they might be potions, scrolls, or charms. In a science fiction
game, cyphers might be interesting throwaway devices or alien crystals
of unknown providence. In other games, they might just represent good
fortune or sudden inspiration. See the Cyphers chapter for more details.

ARTIFACTS

Artifacts are more powerful than equipment and can’t simply be
purchased. The Genre chapter offers a few sample artifacts appropriate
for various settings.

Each artifact has a level and a rate of power depletion. When an
artifact is used or activated, the player rolls the designated die (1d6,
1d10, 1d20, or 1d100). If the die shows the depletion number(s), the
item works, but that is its last use. A depletion entry of “—” means
that the artifact never depletes, and an entry of “automatic” means that
it can be used only once.

Depowered artifacts can sometimes be recharged using the repair rules,
depending on the item’s nature. Other special abilities can also repower
an expended item, but probably for only one use.

For GM information on artifacts, see the Running the Cypher System
chapter.

Finding, Identifying, and USing Artifacts

Characters can sometimes find artifacts while on adventures. They might
be in ancient ruins, either intact or in need of manipulation to get
them working. They could have been stolen from well-guarded military
installations. They might be granted as rewards or taken from fallen
foes. Sometimes they can even be purchased from a specialized source,
but this occurs more rarely than most PCs would probably like.

After the characters find an artifact, identifying it is a separate
Intellect task. The GM sets the difficulty of the task, but it is
usually equal to the artifact’s level. Identifying it takes fifteen
minutes to three hours. If the PCs can’t identify an artifact, they can
bring it to an expert to be identified or, if desired, traded or sold.

Characters can attempt to use an artifact that has not been identified,
which is usually an Intellect task equal to the artifact’s level + 2.
Failure might mean that the PCs can’t figure out how to use the artifact
or they use it incorrectly (GM’s discretion). Of course, even if
characters use an unidentified artifact correctly the first time, they
have no idea what the effect might be.

Once characters identify an artifact, using it for the first time
requires an additional Intellect action; this process is far more
complex than pushing a button. It can involve manipulating touchscreens,
reciting the proper arcane words, or anything else that fits the
setting. The GM sets the difficulty, but it is usually equal to the
artifact’s level.

Rules of the Game

Cypher System games are played in the joint imagination of all the
players, including the GM. The GM sets the scene, the players state what
their characters attempt to do, and the GM determines what happens next.
The rules and the dice help make the game run smoothly, but it’s the
people, not the rules or the dice, that direct the action and determine
the story—and the fun. If a rule gets in the way or detracts from the
game, the players and the GM should work together to change it.

**This is how you play the Cypher System:**

1\. The player tells the GM what they want to do. This is a character
action.

2\. The GM determines if that action is routine (and therefore works
without needing a roll) or if there’s a chance of failure.

3\. If there is a chance of failure, the GM determines which stat the
task uses (Might, Speed, or Intellect) and the task’s difficulty—how
hard it will be on a scale from 1 (really easy) to 10 (basically
impossible).

4\. The player and the GM determine if anything about the character—such
as training, equipment, special abilities, or various actions—can modify
the difficulty up or down by one or more steps. If these modifications
reduce the difficulty to less than 1, the action is routine (and
therefore works with no roll needed).

5\. If the action still isn’t routine, the GM uses its difficulty to
determine the target number—how high the player must roll to succeed at
the action (see the Task Difficulty table). The GM doesn’t have to tell
the player what the target number is, but they can give the player a
hint, especially if the character would reasonably know if the action
was easy, average, difficult, or impossible.

6\. The player rolls a d20. If they roll equal to or higher than the
target number, the character succeeds.

That’s it. That’s how to do anything, whether it’s identifying an
unknown device, calming a raging drunk, climbing a treacherous cliff, or
battling a demigod. Even if you ignored all the other rules, you could
still play the Cypher System with just this information. The key
features here are: character actions, determining task difficulty, and
determining modifications.

KEY CONCEPTS

ACTION: Anything a character does that is significant—punch a foe, leap
a chasm, activate a device, use a special power, and so on. Each
character can take one action in a round.

CHARACTER: Any creature in the game capable of acting, whether it is a
player character (PC) run by a player or a nonplayer character (NPC) run
by the game master (GM). In the Cypher System, even bizarre creatures,
sentient machines, and living energy beings can be “characters.”

DIFFICULTY: A measure of how easy it is to accomplish a task. Difficulty
is rated on a scale from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). Altering the
difficulty to make a task harder is called “hindering.” Altering it to
make a task easier is called “easing.” All changes in difficulty are
measured in steps. Difficulty often equates directly with level, so
opening a level 3 locked door probably has a difficulty of 3.

EASE: A decrease in a task’s difficulty, usually by one step. If
something doesn’t say how many steps it eases a task, then it reduces
the difficulty by one step.

EFFORT: Spending points from a stat Pool to reduce the difficulty of a
task. A PC decides whether or not to apply Effort on their turn before
the roll is made. NPCs never apply Effort.

HINDER: An increase in a task’s difficulty, usually by one step. If
something doesn’t say how many steps it hinders a task, then it
increases the difficulty by one step.

INABILITY: The opposite of trained—you’re hindered whenever you attempt
a task that you have an inability in. If you also become trained in the
task, the training and the inability cancel each other out and you
become practiced.

LEVEL: A way to measure the strength, difficulty, power, or challenge of
something in the game. Everything in the game has a level. NPCs and
objects have levels that determine the difficulty of any task related to
them. For example, an opponent’s level determines how hard they are to
hit or avoid in combat. A door’s level indicates how hard it is to break
down. A lock’s level determines how hard it is to pick. Levels are rated
on a scale from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). PC tiers are a little like
levels, but they go only from 1 to 6 and mechanically work very
differently than levels—for example, a PC’s tier does not determine a
task’s difficulty.

PRACTICED: The normal, unmodified ability to use a skill—not trained,
specialized, or an inability. Your type determines what weapon skills
you’re practiced in; if you aren’t practiced with a type of weapon, you
have an inability in it.

ROLL: A d20 roll made by a PC to determine whether an action is
successful. Although the game occasionally uses other dice, when the
text simply refers to “a roll,” it always means a d20 roll.

ROUND: A length of time about five to ten seconds long. There are about
ten rounds in a minute. When it’s really important to track precise
time, use rounds. Basically, it’s the length of time to take an action
in the game, but since everyone more or less acts simultaneously, all
characters get to take an action each round.

SPECIALIZED: Having an exceptional amount of skill in a task. Being
specialized eases the task by two steps. So, if you are specialized in
climbing, all your climbing tasks are eased by two steps.

STAT: One of the three defining characteristics for PCs: Might, Speed,
or Intellect. Each stat has two values: Pool and Edge. Your Pool
represents your raw, innate ability, and your Edge represents knowing
how to use what you have. Each stat Pool can increase or decrease over
the course of play—for example, you can lose points from your Might Pool
when struck by an opponent, spend points from your Intellect Pool to
activate a special ability, or rest to recover points in your Speed Pool
after a long day of marching. Anything that damages a stat, restores a
stat, or boosts or penalizes a stat affects the stat’s Pool.

TASK: Any action that a PC attempts. The GM determines the difficulty of
the task. In general, a task is something that you do and an action is
you performing that task, but in most cases they mean the same thing.

TRAINED: Having a reasonable amount of skill in a task. Being trained
eases the task. For example, if you are trained in climbing, all
climbing tasks for you are eased. If you become very skilled at that
task, you become specialized instead of trained. You do not need to be
trained to attempt a task.

TURN: The part of the round when a character or creature takes its
actions. For example, if a Warrior and an Adept are fighting an orc,
each round the Warrior takes an action on their turn, the Adept takes an
action on their turn, and the orc takes an action on its turn. Some
abilities or effects last only one turn, or end when the next turn is
started.

TAKING ACTION

Each character gets one turn each round. On a character’s turn, they can
do one thing—an action. All actions fall into one of three categories:
Might, Speed, or Intellect (just like the three stats). Many actions
require die rolls—rolling a d20.

Every action performs a task, and every task has a difficulty that
determines what number a character must reach or surpass with a die roll
to succeed.

Most tasks have a difficulty of 0, which means the character succeeds
automatically. For example, walking across a room, opening a door, and
throwing a stone into a nearby bucket are all actions, but none of them
requires a roll. Actions that are usually difficult or that become
difficult due to the situation (such as shooting at a target in a
blizzard) have a higher difficulty. These actions usually require a
roll.

Some actions require a minimum expenditure of Might, Speed, or Intellect
points. If a character cannot spend the minimum number of points needed
to complete the action, they automatically fail at the task.

DETERMINING TASK STAT

Every task relates to one of a character’s three stats: Might, Speed, or
Intellect. Physical activities that require strength, power, or
endurance relate to Might. Physical activities that require agility,
flexibility, or fast reflexes relate to Speed. Mental activities that
require force of will, memory, or mental power relate to Intellect. This
means you can generalize tasks into three categories: Might tasks, Speed
tasks, and Intellect tasks. You can also generalize rolls into three
categories: Might rolls, Speed rolls, and Intellect rolls.

The category of the task or roll determines what kind of Effort you can
apply to the roll and may determine how a character’s other abilities
affect the roll. For example, an Adept may have an ability that makes
them better at Intellect rolls, and a Warrior may have an ability that
makes them better at Speed rolls.

DETERMINING TASK DIFFICULTY

The most frequent thing a GM does during the game—and probably the most
important thing—is set a task’s difficulty. To make the job easier, use
the Task Difficulty table, which associates a difficulty rating with a
descriptive name, a target number, and general guidance about the
difficulty.

Every difficulty from 1 to 10 has a target number associated with it.
The target number is easy to remember: it’s always three times the
difficulty. The target number is the minimum number a player needs to
roll on a d20 to succeed at the task. Moving up or down on the table is
called hindering or easing, which is measured in steps.

For example, reducing a difficulty 5 task to a difficulty 4 task is
“easing the difficulty by one step” or just “easing the difficulty” or
“easing the task.” Most modifiers affect the difficulty rather than the
player’s roll. This has two consequences:

Low target numbers such as 3 or 6, which would be boring in most games
that use a d20, are not boring in the Cypher System. For example, if you
need to roll a 6 or higher, you still have a 25% chance to fail.

The upper levels of difficulty (7, 8, 9, and 10) are all but impossible
because the target numbers are 21 or higher, which you can’t roll on a
d20. However, it’s common for PCs to have abilities or equipment that
ease a task and thus lower the target number to something they *can*
roll on a d20.

A character’s tier does not determine a task’s level. Things don’t get
more difficult just because a character’s tier increases—the world
doesn’t instantly become a more difficult place. Fourth-tier characters
don’t deal only with level 4 creatures or difficulty 4 tasks (although a
fourth-tier character probably has a better shot at success than a
first-tier character does). Just because something is level 4 doesn’t
necessarily mean it’s meant only for fourth-tier characters. Similarly,
depending on the situation, a fifth-tier character could find a
difficulty 2 task just as challenging as a second-tier character does.

Therefore, when setting the difficulty of a task, the GM should rate the
task on its own merits, not on the power of the characters.

MODIFYING THE DIFFICULTY

After the GM sets the difficulty for a task, the player can try to
modify it for their character. Any such modification applies only to
this particular attempt at the task. In other words, rewiring an
electronic door lock normally might be difficulty 6, but since the
character doing the work is skilled in such tasks, has the right tools,
and has another character assisting them, the difficulty in this
instance might be much lower. That’s why it’s important for the GM to
set a task’s difficulty without taking the character into account. The
character comes in at this step.

By using skills and assets, working together, and—perhaps most
important—applying Effort, a character can ease a task by multiple steps
to make it easier. Rather than adding bonuses to the player’s roll,
reducing the difficulty lowers the target number. If they can reduce the
difficulty of a task to 0, no roll is needed; success is automatic. (An
exception is if the GM decides to use a GM intrusion on the task, in
which case the player would have to make a roll at the original
difficulty.)

There are three basic ways in which a character can ease a task: skills,
assets, and Effort. Each method eases the task by at least one
step—never in smaller increments.

(By using skills, assets, and Effort, a character can ease a task by a
maximum of ten steps: one or two steps from skills, one or two steps
from assets, and one to six steps from Effort.)

SKILLS

Characters may be skilled at performing a specific task. A skill can
vary from character to character. For example, one character might be
skilled at lying, another might be skilled at trickery, and a third
might be skilled in all interpersonal interactions. The first level of
being skilled is called being trained, and it eases that task by one
step. More rarely, a character can be incredibly skilled at performing a
task. This is called being specialized, and it eases the task by two
steps instead of one. Skills can never decrease a task by more than two
steps—any more than two steps from being trained and specialized don’t
count.

ASSETS

An asset is anything that helps a character with a task, such as having
a really good crowbar when trying to force open a door or being in a
rainstorm when trying to put out a fire. Appropriate assets vary from
task to task. The perfect awl might help when woodworking, but it won’t
make a dance performance much better. An asset usually eases a task by
one step. Assets can never ease a task by more than two steps—any more
than two steps from assets don’t count.

(The important thing to remember is that a skill can reduce the
difficulty by no more than two steps, and assets can reduce the
difficulty by no more than two steps, regardless of the situation. Thus,
no task’s difficulty will ever be reduced by more than four steps
without using Effort.)

EFFORT

A player can apply Effort to ease a task. To do this, the player spends
points from the stat Pool that’s most appropriate to the task. For
example, applying Effort to push a heavy rock off a cliff requires a
player to spend points from the character’s Might Pool; applying Effort
to activate an unusual machine interface requires them to spend points
from the character’s Intellect Pool. For every level of Effort spent on
a task, the task is eased. It costs 3 points from a stat Pool to apply
one level of Effort, and it costs 2 additional points for every level
thereafter (so it costs 5 points for two levels of Effort, 7 points for
three levels of Effort, and so on). A character must spend points from
the same stat Pool as the type of task or roll—Might points for a Might
roll, Speed points for a Speed roll, or Intellect points for an
Intellect roll.

Every character has a maximum level of Effort they can apply to a single
task. Effort can never ease a task by more than six steps—any more than
six steps from applying Effort doesn’t count.

Free Level of Effort: A few abilities give you a free level of Effort
(these usually require you to apply at least one level of Effort to a
task). In effect, you’re getting one more level of Effort than what you
paid for. This free level of Effort can exceed the Effort limit for your
character, but not the six-step limit for easing a task.

ROLLING THE DIE

To determine success or failure, a player rolls a die (always a d20). If
they roll the target number or higher, they succeed. Most of the time,
that’s the end of it—nothing else needs to be done. Rarely, a character
might apply a small modifier to the roll. If they have a +2 bonus when
attempting specific actions, they add 2 to the number rolled. However,
the original roll matters if it’s a special roll.

If a character applies a modifier to the die roll, it’s possible to get
a result of 21 or higher, in which case they can attempt a task with a
target number above 20. But if there is no possibility for success—if
not even rolling a natural 20 (meaning the d20 shows that number) is
sufficient to accomplish the task—then no roll is made. Otherwise,
characters would have a chance to succeed at everything, even impossible
or ridiculous tasks such as climbing moonbeams, throwing elephants, or
hitting a target on the opposite side of a mountain with an arrow.

If a character’s modifiers add up to +3, treat them as an asset instead.
In other words, instead of adding a +3 bonus to the roll, reduce the
difficulty by one step. For example, if a Warrior has a +1 bonus to
attack rolls from a minor effect, a +1 bonus to attack rolls from a
special weapon quality, and a +1 bonus to attack rolls from a special
ability, they do not add 3 to their attack roll—instead, they reduce the
difficulty of the attack by one step. So if they attack a level 3 foe,
they would normally roll against difficulty 3 and try to reach a target
number of 9, but thanks to their asset, they roll against difficulty 2
and try to reach a target number of 6.

This distinction is important when stacking skills and assets to
decrease the difficulty of an action, especially since reducing the
difficulty to 0 or lower means no roll is needed.

THE PLAYER ALWAYS ROLLS

In the Cypher System, players always drive the action. That means they
make all the die rolls. If a PC leaps out of a moving vehicle, the
player rolls to see if they succeed. If a PC searches for a hidden
panel, the player rolls to determine whether they find it. If a
rockslide falls on a PC, the player rolls to try to get out of the way.
If a PC and an NPC arm wrestle, the player rolls, and the NPC’s level
determines the target number. If a PC attacks a foe, the player rolls to
see if they hit. If a foe attacks the PC, the player rolls to see if
they dodge the blow.

As shown by the last two examples, the PC rolls whether they are
attacking or defending. Thus, something that improves defenses might
ease or hinder their rolls. For example, if a PC uses a low wall to gain
cover from attacks, the wall eases the player’s defense rolls. If a foe
uses the wall to gain cover from the PC’s attacks, it hinders the
player’s attack rolls.

SPECIAL ROLLS

If a character rolls a natural 1, 17, 18, 19, or 20 (meaning the d20
shows that number), special rules come into play. These are explained in
more detail in the following sections.

1: GM Intrusion. The GM makes a free intrusion (see below) and doesn’t
award experience points (XP) for it.

17: Damage Bonus. If the roll was a damage-dealing attack, it deals 1
additional point of damage.

18: Damage Bonus. If the roll was a damage-dealing attack, it deals 2
additional points of damage.

19: Minor Effect. If the roll was a damage-dealing attack, it deals 3
additional points of damage or the PC gets a minor effect in addition to
the normal results of the task. If the roll was something other than an
attack, the PC gets a minor effect in addition to the normal results of
the task.

20: Major Effect. If the roll was a damage-dealing attack, it deals 4
additional points of damage or the PC gets a major or minor effect in
addition to the normal results of the task. If the roll was something
other than an attack, the PC gets a major effect in addition to the
normal results of the task. If the PC spent points from a stat Pool on
the action, the point cost for the action decreases to 0, meaning the
character regains those points as if they had not spent them at all.

GM INTRUSION

GM intrusion is explained in more detail in the Running the Cypher
System chapter, but essentially it means that something occurs to
complicate the character’s life. The character hasn’t necessarily
fumbled or done anything wrong (although perhaps they did). It could
just be that the task presents an unexpected difficulty or something
unrelated affects the current situation.

For GM intrusion on a defense roll, a roll of 1 might mean that the PC
takes 2 additional points of damage from the attack, indicating that the
opponent got in a lucky blow.

(For complete details about GM intrusion and how to use it to best
effect in the game, see the Running the Cypher System chapter.)

MINOR EFFECT

A minor effect happens when a player rolls a natural 19. Most of the
time, a minor effect is slightly beneficial to the PC, but not
overwhelming.

A climber gets up the steep slope a bit faster. A repaired machine works
a bit better. A character jumping down into a pit lands on their feet.
Either the GM or the player can come up with a possible minor effect
that fits the situation, but both must agree on what it should be.

Don’t waste a lot of time thinking of a minor effect if nothing
appropriate suggests itself. Sometimes, in cases where only success or
failure matters, it’s okay to have no minor effect. Keep the game moving
at an exciting pace.

In combat, the easiest and most straightforward minor effect is dealing
3 additional points of damage with an attack. The following are other
common minor effects for combat:

Damage object: Instead of striking the foe, the attack strikes what the
foe is holding. If the attack hits, the character makes a Might roll
with a difficulty equal to the object’s level. On a success, the object
moves one or more steps down the object damage track.

Distract: For one round, all of the foe’s tasks are hindered.

Knock back: The foe is knocked or forced back a few feet. Most of the
time, this doesn’t matter much, but if the fight takes place on a ledge
or next to a pit of lava, the effect can be significant.

Move past: The character can move a short distance at the end of the
attack. This effect is useful to get past a foe guarding a door, for
example.

Strike a specific body part: The attacker strikes a specific spot on the
defender’s body. The GM rules what special effect, if any, results. For
example, hitting a creature’s tentacle that is wrapped around an ally
might make it easier for the ally to escape. Hitting a foe in the eye
might blind it for one round. Hitting a creature in its one vulnerable
spot might ignore Armor.

Usually, the GM just has the desired minor effect occur. For example,
rolling a 19 against a relatively weak foe means it is knocked off the
cliff. The effect makes the round more exciting, but the defeat of a
minor creature has no significant impact on the story. Other times, the
GM might rule that an additional roll is needed to achieve the
effect—the special roll only gives the PC the *opportunity* for a minor
effect. This mostly happens when the desired effect is very unlikely,
such as pushing a 50-ton battle automaton off a cliff. If the player
just wants to deal 3 additional points of damage as the minor effect, no
extra roll is needed.

MAJOR EFFECT

A major effect happens when a player rolls a natural 20. Most of the
time, a major effect is quite beneficial to the character. A climber
gets up the steep slope in half the time. A jumper lands with such
panache that those nearby are impressed and possibly intimidated. A
defender makes a free attack on a foe.

Either the GM or the player can come up with a possible major effect
that fits the situation, but both must agree on what it should be. As
with minor effects, don’t spend a lot of time agonizing over the details
of a major effect. In cases where only success or failure matters, a
major effect might offer the character a one-time asset (a modification
of one step) to use the next time they attempt a similar action. When
nothing else seems appropriate, the GM can simply grant the PC an
additional action on their turn that same round.

In combat, the easiest and most straightforward  
major effect is dealing 4 additional points of damage with an attack.
The following are other common major effects for combat.

Disarm: The foe drops one object that it is holding.

Impair: For the rest of the combat, all tasks the foe attempts are
hindered.

Knock down: The foe is knocked prone. It can get up on its turn.

Stun: The foe loses its next action.

As with minor effects, usually the GM just has the desired major effect
occur, but sometimes the GM might require an extra roll if the major
effect is unusual or unlikely.

Retrying a Task after failure

If a character fails a task (whether it’s climbing a wall, picking a
lock, trying to figure out a mysterious device, or something else) they
can attempt it again, but they must apply at least one level of Effort
when retrying that task. A retry is a new action, not part of the same
action that failed, and it takes the same amount of time as the first
attempt did.

Sometimes the GM might rule that retries are impossible. Perhaps a
character has one chance to convince the leader of a group of thugs not
to attack, and after that, no amount of talking will stop them.

This rule doesn’t apply to something like attacking a foe in combat
because combat is always changing and fluid. Each round’s situation is
new, not a repeat of a previous situation, so a missed attack can’t be
retried.

INITIAL COST

The GM can assign a point cost to a task just for trying it. Called an
initial cost, it’s simply an indication that the task is particularly
taxing. For example, let’s say a character wants to try a Might action
to open a heavy cellar door that is partially rusted shut. The GM says
that forcing the door open is a difficulty 5 task, and there’s an
initial cost of 3 Might points simply to try. This initial cost is in
addition to any points the character chooses to spend on the roll (such
as when applying Effort), and the initial cost points do not affect the
difficulty of the task. In other words, the character must spend 3 Might
points to attempt the task at all, but that doesn’t help them open the
door. If they want to apply Effort to ease the task, they have to spend
more points from their Might Pool.

Edge helps with the initial cost of a task, just as it does with any
expenditure from a character’s Pool. In the previous example, if the
character had a Might Edge of 2, they would have to spend only 1 point
(3 points minus 2 from their Might Edge) for the initial cost to attempt
the task. If they also applied a level of Effort to open the door, they
couldn’t use their Edge again—Edge applies only once per action—so using
the Effort would cost the full 3 points. Thus, they’d spend a total of 4
points (1 for the initial cost plus 3 for the Effort) from their Might
Pool.

The rationale of the initial cost rule is that even in the Cypher
System, where things like Effort can help a character succeed on an
action, logic still suggests that some actions are very difficult and
taxing, particularly for some PCs more than others.

DISTANCE

Distance is simplified into four basic categories: immediate, short,
long, and very long.

Immediate distance from a character is within reach or within a few
steps; if a character stands in a small room, everything in the room is
within immediate distance. At most, immediate distance is 10 feet (3 m).
Immediate distance is sometimes referred to as close, or even  
point-blank, particularly when referring to ranges.

(The words “immediate” and “close” can be used interchangeably to talk
about distance. If a creature or object is within arm’s reach of the
character, it can be considered both immediate and close.)

Short distance is anything greater than immediate distance but less than
50 feet (15 m) or so.

Long distance is anything greater than short distance but less than 100
feet (30 m) or so.

Very long distance is anything greater than long distance but less than
500 feet (150 m) or so.

Beyond that range, distances are always specified—1,000 feet (300 m), 1
mile (1.5 km), and so on.

All weapons and special abilities use these terms for ranges. For
example, all melee weapons have immediate range—they are close-combat
weapons, and you can use them to attack anyone within immediate
distance. A thrown knife (and most other thrown weapons) has short
range. A small handgun also has short range. A rifle has long range.

A character can move an immediate distance as a part of another action.
In other words, they can take a few steps to the light switch and flip
it on. They can lunge across a small room to attack a foe. They can open
a door and step through.

A character can move a short distance as their entire action for a turn.
They can also try to move a long distance as their entire action, but
the player might have to roll to see if the character slips, trips, or
stumbles for moving so far so quickly.

GMs and players don’t need to determine exact distances. For example, if
the PCs are fighting a group of guards, any character can likely attack
any foe in the general melee—they’re all within immediate range.
However, if one trooper stays back to fire a blaster, a character might
have to use their entire action to move the short distance required to
attack that foe. It doesn’t matter if the trooper is 20 feet (6 m) or 40
feet (12 m) away—it’s simply considered short distance. It does matter
if the trooper is more than 50 feet (15 m) away because that distance
would require a long move.

Boxed text:

OTHER DISTANCES

In rare cases where distances beyond very long are needed, real-world
distances are best (1 mile, 100 kilometers, and so on). However, the
following shorthand distances can be useful in some settings:

Planetary: On the same planet.

Interplanetary: Within the same solar system.

Interstellar: Within the same galaxy.

Intergalactic: Anywhere in the same universe.

Interdimensional: Anywhere.

TIMEKEEPING

Generally, keep time the same way that you normally would, using
minutes, hours, days, and weeks. Thus, if the characters walk overland
for 15 miles (24 km), about eight hours pass, even though the journey
can be described in only a few seconds at the game table. Precision
timekeeping is rarely important. Most of the time, saying things like
“That takes about an hour” works fine.

This is true even when a special ability has a specific duration. In an
encounter, a duration of “one minute” is mostly the same as saying “the
rest of the encounter.” You don’t have to track each round that ticks by
if you don’t want to. Likewise, an ability that lasts for ten minutes
can safely be considered the length of an in-depth conversation, the
time it takes to quickly explore a small area, or the time it takes to
rest after a strenuous activity.

ENCOUNTERS, ROUNDS, AND INITIATIVE

Sometimes in the course of the game, the GM or players will refer to an
“encounter.” Encounters are not so much measurements of time as they are
events or instances in which something happens, like a scene of a movie
or a chapter in a book. An encounter might be a fight with a foe, a
dramatic crossing of a raging river, or a stressful negotiation with an
important official. It’s useful to use the word when referring to a
specific scene, as in “My Might Pool is low after that encounter with
the soul sorcerer yesterday.”

A round is about five to ten seconds. The length of time is variable
because sometimes one round might be a bit longer than another. You
don’t need to measure time more precisely than that. You can estimate
that on average there are about ten rounds in a minute. In a round,
everyone—each character and NPC—gets to take one action.

To determine who goes first, second, and so on in a round, each player
makes a Speed roll called an initiative roll. Most of the time, it’s
only important to know which characters act before the NPCs and which
act after the NPCs. On an initiative roll, a character who rolls higher
than an NPC’s target number takes their action before the NPC does. As
with all target numbers, an NPC’s target number for an initiative roll
is three times the NPC’s level. Many times, the GM will have all NPCs
take their actions at the same time, using the highest target number
from among all the NPCs. Using this method, any characters who rolled
higher than the target number act first, then all the NPCs act, and
finally any characters who rolled lower than the target number act.

(An initiative roll is a d20 roll. Since your initiative depends on how
fast you are, if you spend Effort on the roll, the points come from your
Speed Pool.)

The order in which the characters act usually isn’t important. If the
players want to go in a precise order, they can act in initiative order
(highest to lowest), by going around the table, by going oldest to
youngest, and so on.

For example, Charles, Tammie, and Shanna’s characters are in combat with
two level 2 security guards. The GM has the players make Speed rolls to
determine initiative. Charles rolls an 8, Shanna rolls a 15, and Tammie
rolls a 4. The target number for a level 2 creature is 6, so each round
Charles and Shanna act before the guards, then the guards act, and
finally Tammie acts. It doesn’t matter whether Charles acts before or
after Shanna, as long as they think it’s fair.

After everyone—all PCs and NPCs—in the combat has had a turn, the round
ends and a new round begins. In all rounds after the first, everyone
acts in the same order as they did in the first round. The characters
cycle through this order until the logical end of the encounter (the end
of the fight or the completion of the event) or until the GM asks them
to make new initiative rolls. The GM can call for new initiative rolls
at the beginning of any new round when conditions drastically change.
For example, if the NPCs gain reinforcements, the environment changes
(perhaps the lights go out), the terrain changes (maybe part of the
balcony collapses under the PCs), or something similar occurs, the GM
can call for new initiative rolls.

Since the action moves as a cycle, anything that lasts for a round ends
where it started in the cycle. If Umberto uses an ability on an opponent
that hinders its defenses for one round, the effect lasts until Umberto
acts on his next turn.

A CLOSER LOOK AT SITUATIONS THAT DON’T INVOLVE PCs

Ultimately, the GM is the arbiter of conflicts that do not involve the
PCs. They should be adjudicated in the most interesting, logical, and
story-based way possible. When in doubt, match the level of the NPCs
(characters or creatures) or their respective effects to determine the
results. Thus, if a level 4 NPC fights a level 3 NPC, the level 4 NPC
will win, but if they face a level 7 NPC, they’ll lose. Likewise, a
level 4 creature resists poisons or devices of level 3 or lower but not
those of level 5 and above.

The essence is this: in the Cypher System, it doesn’t matter if
something is a creature, a poison, or a gravity-dispelling ray. If it’s
a higher level, it wins; if it’s a lower level, it loses. If two things
of equal level oppose each other, there might be a long, drawn-out
battle that could go either way.

ACTIONS

Anything that your character does in a round is an action. It’s easiest
to think of an action as a single thing that you can do in five to ten
seconds. For example, if you use your dart thrower to shoot a strange
floating orb, that’s one action. So is running for cover behind a stack
of barrels, prying open a stuck door, using a rope to pull your friend
up from a pit, or activating a cypher (even if it’s stored in your
pack).

Opening a door and attacking a security guard on the other side are two
actions. It’s more a matter of focus than time. Drawing your sword and
attacking a foe is all one action. Putting away your bow and pushing a
heavy bookcase to block a door are two actions because each requires a
different train of thought.

If the action you want to accomplish is not within reach, you can move a
little bit. Essentially, you can move up to an immediate distance to
perform your action. For example, you can move an immediate distance and
attack a foe, open a door and move an immediate distance into the
hallway beyond, or grab your hurt friend lying on the ground and pull
them back a few steps. This movement can occur before or after your
action, so you can move to a door and open it, or you can open a door
and move through it.

**The most common actions are:**

Attack

Activate a special ability (one that isn’t an attack)

Move

Wait

Defend

Do something else

ACTION: ATTACK

An attack is anything that you do to someone that they don’t want you to
do. Slashing a foe with a curved dagger is an attack, blasting a foe
with a lightning artifact is an attack, wrapping a foe in magnetically
controlled metal cables is an attack, and controlling someone’s mind is
an attack. An attack almost always requires a roll to see if you hit or
otherwise affect your target.

In the simplest kind of attack, such as a PC trying to stab a thug with
a knife, the player rolls and compares their result to the opponent’s
target number. If their roll is equal to or greater than the target
number, the attack hits. Just as with any kind of task, the GM might
modify the difficulty based on the situation, and the player might have
a bonus to the roll or might try to ease the task using skills, assets,
or Effort.

A less straightforward attack might be a special ability that stuns a
foe with a mental blast. However, it’s handled the same way: the player
makes a roll against the opponent’s target number. Similarly, an attempt
to tackle a foe and wrestle it to the ground is still just a roll
against the foe’s target number.

Attacks are sometimes categorized as “melee” attacks, meaning that you
hurt or affect something within immediate reach, or “ranged” attacks,
meaning that you hurt or affect something at a distance.

Melee attacks can be Might or Speed actions—player choice. Physical
ranged attacks (such as bows, thrown weapons, and blasts of fire from a
mutation) are almost always Speed actions, but those that come from
special abilities tend to be Intellect actions.

Special abilities that require touching the target require a melee
attack. If the attack misses, the power is not wasted, and you can try
again each round as your action until you hit the target, use another
ability, or take a different action that requires you to use your hands.
These attempts in later rounds count as different actions, so you don’t
have to keep track of how much Effort you used when you activated the
ability or how you used Edge. For example, let’s say that in the first
round of combat, you activate a special ability that requires you to
touch your foe and you use Effort to ease the attack, but you roll
poorly and miss your foe. In the second round of combat, you can try
attacking again and use Effort to ease the attack roll.

The GM and players are encouraged to describe every attack with flavor
and flair. One attack roll might be a stab to the foe’s arm. A miss
might be the PC’s sword slamming into the wall. Combatants lunge, block,
duck, spin, leap, and make all kinds of movements that should keep
combat visually interesting and compelling. The Running the Cypher
System chapter has much more guidance in this regard.

Common elements that affect the difficulty of a combat task are cover,
range, and darkness. The rules for these and other modifiers are
explained in the Attack Modifiers and Special Situations section of this
chapter.

Damage

When an attack strikes a character, it usually means the character takes
damage.

An attack against a PC subtracts points from one of the character’s stat
Pools—usually the Might Pool. Whenever an attack simply says it deals
“damage” without specifying the type, it means Might damage, which is by
far the most common type. Intellect damage, which is usually the result
of a mental attack, is always labeled as Intellect damage. Speed damage
is often a physical attack, but attacks that deal Speed damage are
fairly rare.

NPCs don’t have stat Pools. Instead, they have a characteristic called
health. When an NPC takes damage of any kind, the amount is subtracted
from its health. Unless described otherwise, an NPC’s health is always
equal to its target number. Some NPCs might have special reactions to or
defenses against attacks that would normally deal Speed damage or
Intellect damage, but unless the NPC’s description specifically explains
this, assume that all damage is subtracted from the NPC’s health.

Objects don’t have stat Pools or health. They have an object damage
track, just like how PCs have a damage track. Attacking objects might
move them down their damage track.

Damage is always a specific amount determined by the attack. For
example, a slash with a broadsword or a blast with a spike thrower deals
4 points of damage. An Adept’s Onslaught deals 4 points of damage.
Often, there are ways for the attacker to increase the damage. For
example, a PC can apply Effort to deal 3 additional points of damage,
and rolling a natural 17 on the attack roll deals 1 additional point of
damage.

Armor

Pieces of equipment and special abilities protect a character from
damage by giving them Armor. Each time a character takes damage,
subtract their Armor value from the damage before reducing their stat
Pool or health. For example, if a Warrior with 2 Armor is hit by a
gunshot that deals 4 points of damage, they take only 2 points of damage
(4 minus 2 from their Armor). If Armor reduces the incoming damage to 0
or lower, the character takes no damage from the attack. For example,
the Warrior’s 2 Armor protects them from all physical attacks that deal
1 or 2 points of damage.

The most common way to get Armor is to wear physical armor, such as a
leather jacket, a bulletproof vest, a chainmail hauberk, bioengineered
carapace grafts, or something else, depending on the setting. All
physical armor comes in one of three categories: light, medium, or
heavy. Light armor gives the wearer 1 point of Armor, medium gives 2
points of Armor, and heavy gives 3 points of Armor.

When you see the word “Armor” capitalized in the game rules (other than
in the name of a special ability), it refers to your Armor
characteristic—the number you subtract from incoming damage. When you
see the word “armor” in lowercase, it refers to any physical armor you
might wear.

Other effects can add to a character’s Armor. If a character is wearing
chainmail (+2 to Armor) and has an ability that covers them in a
protective force field that grants +1 to Armor, their total is 3 Armor.
If they also use a cypher that hardens their flesh temporarily for +1 to
Armor, their total is 4 Armor.

Some types of damage ignore physical armor. Attacks that specifically
deal Speed damage or Intellect damage ignore Armor; the creature takes
the listed amount of damage without any reduction from Armor. Ambient
damage (see below) usually ignores Armor as well.

A creature may have a special bonus to Armor against certain kinds of
attacks. For example, a protective suit made of a sturdy, fire-resistant
material might normally give its wearer +1 to Armor but count as +3 to
Armor against fire attacks. An artifact worn as a helmet might grant +2
to Armor only against mental attacks.

Ambient Damage

Some kinds of damage aren’t direct attacks against a creature, but they
indirectly affect everything in the area. Most of these are
environmental effects such as winter cold, high temperatures, or
background radiation. Damage from these kinds of sources is called
ambient damage. Physical armor usually doesn’t protect against ambient
damage, though a well-insulated suit of armor can protect against cold
weather.

Damage From Hazards

Attacks aren’t the only way to inflict damage on a character.
Experiences such as falling from a great height, being burned in a fire,
and spending time in severe weather also deal damage. Although no list
of potential hazards could be comprehensive, the Damage From Hazards
table includes common examples.

SPACE HAZARDS

A few specific hazards that you can include as part of an encounter
involving a spacecraft follow. These hazards are more site specific than
the general threats presented in Chapter 5: Conflicts of the Future.

GRAVITY WELL

All bodies in space produce a gravitational field, though usually only
things the size of a small moon or larger pose a hazard to unprepared
(and sometimes even to prepared) spacecraft. The larger the body, the
“deeper” and wider the associated gravity field. Any time a spacecraft
launches from a moon or planet, it must escape the gravity well. For RPG
purposes, that’s either a routine task, or a low-difficulty one
(assuming no complicating factors are at play). 

Gravity wells become a hazard when a spacecraft encounters one
unexpectedly— usually because of a navigational or sensor error, but
occasionally because of a moon or extreme gravity source being someplace
unforeseen. 

Slingshot Trajectory: An unexpected encounter with a gravity well can
sling a spacecraft off on a new and unwanted trajectory on a failed
piloting task, the difficulty determined by the situation.

Captured: An unexpected encounter with a gravity well can also capture a
spacecraft in the gravity well’s orbit, forcing the craft to expend
additional power to get free (power it may or may not have)

BLACK HOLE

Black holes are just extreme gravity wells. All the dangers associated
with a gravity well also apply to black holes. A couple of additional
hazards are also associated with black holes, notably tidal destruction
(“spaghettification”), time dilation, and being swallowed.

Tidal Desctruction: Mechanically speaking, while a spacecraft feels
tidal forces by passing too close to a black hole’s event horizon, all
tasks aboard the craft are hindered, Void Rules are in effect, and if a
GM intrusion is triggered thereby, the ship sustains major damage and
risks coming apart. Meanwhile, PCs in the ship (assuming some sort of
fantastic tech-rated gravity nullifier isn’t in use) suffer 1 point of
ambient damage each round. 

A ship near a very large black hole (like Sagittarius A\*, the
supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy) can avoid
tidal effects because the gravity gradient is so much wider, but still
feel relativistic time dilation.

Relativistic Time Dialation: From a mechanical perspective, spacecraft
that survive close encounters with black holes and return to normal
space discover that more time has passed than expected, which could
range from fairly inconsequential minutes or hours, to far more serious
days, months, years, centuries, or more.

Past the Event Horizon: The event horizon is the point of no return,
where not even light can escape the clutch of gravity. If a spacecraft
falls into a black hole, assuming it is not spaghettified by tidal
forces, it is still lost from the universe of its origin. At least, it’s
lost assuming no intervention from a fantastic tech-rated
post-singularity AI or ancient ultra.

RADIATION BELT/SOLAR FLARE

Radiation belts of intensely charged particles trapped by magnetic
fields around some planets and moons can surge, causing radiation
exposure. An unexpected solar flare, or the drive plume of a massive
spacecraft, can cause the same unexpected exposure.

Ship Damage: The ship suffers minor or major damage, requiring repair
and perhaps even replacement of parts. This damage is as serious as you
require for the purposes of creating an interesting story.

Radiation Sickness: When PCs are exposed to intense radiation, they
suffer 3 points of ambient radiation damage for each minute the
character fails a difficulty 3 Might defense task. If the character
fails three such defense rolls during any single period of radiation
exposure, they suffer acute radiation sickness, a level 8 disease that
drops them one step on the damage track for each day they fail a Might
defense roll until they expire.

ASTEROID/DEBRIS FIELD

Movies often depict asteroid belts as densely packed fields of tumbling
rock that ships must constantly swerve through to avoid a collision.
Such locations are not easy to find in the solar system. But such
situations can occur in fantastic settings, or possibly in solar systems
other than Earth’s. 

Evasive Ateroid Piloting: During any round a spacecraft moves through a
densely packed asteroid or debris field, the pilot (or shipmind) must
succeed on a piloting task, whose difficulty is set by the situation. On
a failed roll, a collision occurs. Each time a collision occurs, the
ship (and possibly its crew) is damaged according to the track laid out
below. Collisions are assumed to be major rocks or pieces of debris, or
possibly a series of smaller pieces of debris all impacting nearly
simultaneously, with one getting through the shielding.

Finding Shelter: The best way to find shelter in order to effect
repairs, or hide from pursuers, is to try to find an asteroid or piece
of debris large enough for the spacecraft to land on or find a crevice
to slide into. To land a spacecraft on an asteroid or big piece of
debris is a challenging (difficulty 5) piloting task to match the
asteroid’s spin, then slide into the cramped space.

The Effects of Taking Damage

When an NPC reaches 0 health, it is either dead or (if the attacker
wishes) incapacitated, meaning unconscious or beaten into submission.

As previously mentioned, damage from most sources is applied to a
character’s Might Pool. Otherwise, stat damage always reduces the Pool
of the stat it affects.

If damage reduces a character’s stat Pool to 0, any further damage to
that stat (including excess damage from the attack that reduced the stat
to 0) is applied to another stat Pool. Damage is applied to Pools in
this order:

1\. Might (unless the Pool is 0)

2\. Speed (unless the Pool is 0)

3\. Intellect

Even if the damage is applied to another stat Pool, it still counts as
its original type for the purpose of Armor and special abilities that
affect damage. For example, if a character with 2 Armor is reduced to 0
Might and then is hit by a creature’s claw for 3 points of damage, it
still counts as Might damage, so their Armor reduces the damage to 1
point, which then is applied to their Speed Pool. In other words, even
though they take the damage from their Speed Pool, it doesn’t ignore
Armor like Speed damage normally would.

In addition to taking damage from their Might Pool, Speed Pool, or
Intellect Pool, PCs also have a damage track. The damage track has four
states (from best to worst): hale, impaired, debilitated, and dead. When
one of a PC’s stat Pools reaches 0, they move one step down the damage
track. Thus, if they are hale, they become impaired. If they are already
impaired, they become debilitated. If they are already debilitated, they
become dead.

Some effects can immediately shift a PC one or more steps on the damage
track. These include rare poisons, cellular disruption attacks, and
massive traumas (such as falls from very great heights, being run over
by a speeding vehicle, and so on, as determined by the GM).

Some attacks, like a serpent’s poisonous bite or a Speaker’s Enthrall,
have effects other than damage to a stat Pool or shifting the PC on the
damage track. These attacks can cause unconsciousness, paralysis, and so
on.

(When NPCs (who have only health) suffer Speed or Intellect damage,
normally this is treated the same as Might damage. However, the GM or
the player has the option to suggest an appropriate alternate effect—the
NPC suffers a penalty, moves more slowly, is stunned, and so on.)

The Damage Track

As noted above, the damage track has four states: hale, impaired,
debilitated, and dead.

Hale is the normal state for a character: all three stat Pools are at 1
or higher, and the PC has no penalties from harmful conditions. When a
hale PC takes enough damage to reduce one of their stat Pools to 0, they
become impaired. Note that a character whose stat Pools are much lower
than normal can still be hale.

Impaired is a wounded or injured state. When an impaired character
applies Effort, it costs 1 extra point per level applied. For example,
applying one level of Effort costs 4 points instead of 3, and applying
two levels of Effort costs 7 points instead of 5.

An impaired character ignores minor and major effect results on their
rolls, and they don’t deal as much extra damage in combat with a special
roll. In combat, a roll of 17 or higher deals only 1 additional point of
damage. When an impaired PC takes enough damage to reduce one of their
stat Pools to 0, they become debilitated.

Debilitated is a critically injured state. A debilitated character may
not take any actions other than to move (probably crawl) no more than an
immediate distance. If a debilitated character’s Speed Pool is 0, they
can’t move at all. When a debilitated PC takes enough damage to reduce a
stat Pool to 0, they are dead.

Dead is dead.

(The damage track allows you to know how far from death you are. If
you’re hale, you’re three steps from death. If you’re impaired, you’re
two steps from death. If you’re debilitated, you are only one small step
from death’s door.)

Recovering Points in a Pool

After losing or spending points in a Pool, you recover those points by
resting. You can’t increase a Pool past its maximum by resting—just back
to its normal level. Any extra points gained go away with no effect. The
amount of points you recover from a rest, and how long each rest takes,
depends on how many times you have rested so far that day.

When you rest, make a recovery roll. To do this, roll a d6 and add your
tier. You recover that many points, and you can divide them among your
stat Pools however you wish. For example, if your recovery roll is 4 and
you’ve lost 4 points of Might and 2 points of Speed, you can recover 4
points of Might, or 2 points of Might and 2 points of Speed, or any
other combination adding up to 4 points.

The first time you rest each day, it takes only a few seconds to catch
your breath. If you rest this way in the middle of an encounter, it
takes one action on your turn.

The second time you rest each day, you must rest for ten minutes to make
a recovery roll. The third time you rest each day, you must rest for one
hour to make a recovery roll. The fourth time you rest each day, you
must rest for ten hours to make a recovery roll (usually, this occurs
when you stop for the day to eat and sleep).

After that much rest, it’s assumed to be a new day, so the next time you
rest, it takes only a few seconds. The next rest takes ten minutes, then
one hour, and so on, in a cycle.

If you haven’t rested yet that day and you take a lot of damage in a
fight, you could rest a few seconds (regaining 1d6 points + 1 point per
tier) and then immediately rest for ten minutes (regaining another 1d6
points + 1 point per tier). Thus, in one full day of doing nothing but
resting, you could recover 4d6 points + 4 points per tier.

Each character chooses when to make recovery rolls. If a party of five
PCs rests for ten minutes because two of them want to make recovery
rolls, the others don’t have to make rolls at that time. Later in the
day, those three can decide to rest for ten minutes and make recovery
rolls.

|                      |                  |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Recovery Roll        | Rest Time Needed |
| First recovery roll  | One action       |
| Second recovery roll | Ten minutes      |
| Third recovery roll  | One hour         |
| Fourth recovery roll | Ten hours        |

Restoring the Damage Track

Using points from a recovery roll to raise a stat Pool from 0 to 1 or
higher also automatically moves the character up one step on the damage
track.

If all of a PC’s stat Pools are above 0 and the character has taken
special damage that moved them down the damage track, they can use a
recovery roll to move up one step on the damage track instead of
recovering points. For example, a character who is debilitated from a
hit with a  
cell-disrupting biotech device can rest and move up to impaired rather
than recover points in a Pool.

Special Damage

In the course of playing the game, characters face all manner of threats
and dangers that can harm them in a variety of ways, only some of which
are easily represented by points of damage.

Dazed and Stunned: Characters can be dazed when struck hard on the head,
exposed to extremely loud sounds, or affected by a mental attack. When
this happens, for the duration of the daze effect (usually one round),
all of the character’s tasks are hindered. Similar but more severe
attacks can stun characters. Stunned characters lose their turn (but can
still defend against attacks normally).

Poison and Disease: When characters encounter poison—whether the venom
of a serpent, rat poison slipped into a burrito, cyanide dissolved in
wine, or an overdose of acetaminophen—they make a Might defense roll to
resist it. Failure to resist can result in points of damage, moving down
the damage track, or a specific effect such as paralysis,
unconsciousness, disability, or something stranger. For example, some
poisons affect the brain, making it impossible to say certain words,
take certain actions, resist certain effects, or recover points to a
stat Pool.

Diseases work like poisons, but their effect occurs every day, so the
victim must make a Might defense roll each day or suffer the effects.
Disease effects are as varied as poisons: points of damage, moving down
the damage track, disability, and so on. Many diseases inflict damage
that cannot be restored through conventional means.

Paralysis: Paralytic effects cause a character to drop to the ground,
unable to move. Unless otherwise specified, the character can still take
actions that require no physical movement.

Other Effects: Other special effects can render a character blind or
deaf, unable to stand without falling over, or unable to breathe.
Stranger effects might negate gravity for the character (or increase it
a hundredfold), transport them to another place, render them out of
phase, mutate their physical form, implant false memories or senses,
alter the way their brain processes information, or inflame their nerves
so they are in constant, excruciating pain. Each special effect must be
handled on a case-by-case basis. The GM adjudicates how the character is
affected and how the condition can be alleviated (if possible).

NPCs and Special Damage

The GM always has final say over what special damage will affect an NPC.
Human NPCs usually react like characters, but nonhuman creatures might
react very differently. For example, a tiny bit of venom is unlikely to
hurt a gigantic dragon, and it won’t affect an android or a demon at
all.

If an NPC is susceptible to an attack that would shift a character down
the damage track, using that attack on the NPC usually renders it
unconscious or dead. Alternatively, the GM could apply the debilitated
condition to the NPC, with the same effect as it would have on a PC.

ATTACK MODIFIERS AND SPECIAL SITUATIONS

In combat situations, many modifiers might come into play. Although the
GM is at liberty to assess whatever modifiers they think are appropriate
to the situation (that’s their role in the game), the following
suggestions and guidelines might make that easier. Often the modifier is
applied as a step in difficulty. So if a situation hinders attacks, that
means if a PC attacks an NPC, the difficulty of the attack roll is
increased by one step, and if an NPC attacks a PC, the difficulty of the
defense roll is decreased by one step. This is because players make all
rolls, whether they are attacking or defending—NPCs never make attack or
defense rolls.

When in doubt, if it seems like it should be harder to attack in a
situation, hinder the attack rolls. If it seems like attacks should gain
an advantage or be easier in some way, hinder the defense rolls.

(Precise ranges are not important in the Cypher System. The broadly
defined “immediate,” “short,” “long,” and “very long” ranges let the GM
quickly make a judgment call and keep things moving. Basically, the idea
is: your target is right there, your target is close, your target is
pretty far away, or your target is extremely far away.)

Cover

If a character is behind cover so that a significant portion of their
body is behind something sturdy, attacks against the character are
hindered.

If a character is entirely behind cover (their entire body is behind
something sturdy), they can’t be attacked unless the attack can go
through the cover. For example, if a character hides behind a thin
wooden screen and their opponent shoots the screen with a rifle that can
penetrate the wood, the character can be attacked. However, because the
attacker can’t see the character clearly, this still counts as cover
(attacks against the character are hindered).

Position

Sometimes where a character stands gives them an advantage or a
disadvantage.

Prone Target: In melee, a prone target is easier to hit (attacks against
them are eased). In ranged combat, a prone target is harder to hit
(attacks against them are hindered).

Higher Ground: In either ranged or melee combat, attacks by an opponent
on higher ground are eased.

Surprise

When a target isn’t aware of an incoming attack, the attacker has an
advantage. A ranged sniper in a hidden position, an invisible assailant,
or the first salvo in a successful ambush are all eased by two steps.
For the attacker to gain this advantage, however, the defender truly
must have no idea that the attack is coming.

If the defender isn’t sure of the attacker’s location but is still on
guard, the attacks are eased by only one step.

Range

In melee, you can attack a foe who is adjacent to you (next to you) or
within reach (immediate range). If you enter into melee with one or more
foes, usually you can attack most or all of the combatants, meaning they
are next to you, within reach, or within reach if you move slightly or
have a long weapon that extends your reach.

The majority of ranged attacks have only two ranges: short range and
long range (a few have very long range). Short range is generally less
than 50 feet (15 m) or so. Long range is generally from 50 feet (15 m)
to about 100 feet (30 m). Very long range is generally 100 feet (30 m)
to 500 feet (150 m). Greater precision than that isn’t important in the
Cypher System. If anything is longer than very long range, the exact
range is usually spelled out, such as with an item that can fire a beam
1,000 feet (300 m) or teleport you up to 1 mile (1.5 km) away.

Thus, the game has four measurements of distance: immediate, short,
long, and very long. These apply to movement as well. A few special
cases—point-blank range and extreme range— modify an attack’s chance to
successfully hit.

Point-Blank Range: If a character uses a ranged weapon against a target
within immediate range, the attack is eased.

Extreme Range: Targets just at the limit of a weapon’s range are at
extreme range. Attacks against such targets are hindered.

(The GM might allow a character with a ranged weapon to attack beyond
extreme range, but the attack would be hindered by two steps for each
range category beyond the normal limit. Attacks with hard limits, such
as the blast radius of a bomb, can’t be modified.)

(In certain situations, such as a PC on top of a building looking across
an open field, the GM should allow ranged attacks to exceed their
maximum range. For example, in perfect conditions, a good archer can hit
a large target with a bow and arrow at 500 feet (150 m), much farther
than a bow’s typical long range.)

Illumination

What characters can see (and how well they can see) plays a huge factor
in combat.

Dim Light: Dim light is approximately the amount of light on a night
with a bright full moon or the illumination provided by a torch,
flashlight, or desk lamp. Dim light allows you to see out to short
range. Targets in dim light are harder to hit. Attacks against such
targets are hindered. Attackers trained in low-light spotting negate
this modifier.

Very Dim Light: Very dim light is approximately the amount of light on a
starry night with no visible moon, or the glow provided by a candle or
an illuminated control panel. Very dim light allows you to see clearly
only within immediate range and perceive vague shapes to short range.
Targets in very dim light are harder to hit. Attacks against targets
within immediate range are hindered, and attacks against those in short
range are hindered by two steps. Attackers trained in low-light spotting
modify these difficulties by one step in their favor. Attackers
specialized in low-light spotting modify these difficulties by two steps
in their favor.

Darkness: Darkness is an area with no illumination at all, such as a
moonless night with cloud cover or a room with no lights. Targets in
complete darkness are nearly impossible to hit. If an attacker can use
other senses (such as hearing) to get an idea of where the opponent
might be, attacks against such targets are hindered by four steps.
Otherwise, attacks in complete darkness fail without the need for a roll
unless the player spends 1 XP to “make a lucky shot” or the GM uses GM
intrusion. Attackers trained in low-light spotting ease the task.
Attackers specialized in low-light spotting ease the task by two steps.

Visibility

Similar to illumination, factors that obscure vision affect combat.

Mist: A target in mist is similar to one in dim light. Ranged attacks
against such targets are hindered. Particularly dense mist makes ranged
attacks nearly impossible (treat as darkness), and even melee attacks
are hindered.

Hiding Target: A target in dense foliage, behind a screen, or crawling
amid the rubble in a ruin is hard to hit because they’re hard to see.
Ranged attacks against such targets are hindered.

Invisible Target: If an attacker can use other senses (such as hearing)
to get an idea of where the opponent might be, attacks against such
targets are hindered by four steps. Otherwise, attacks against an
invisible creature fail without the need for a roll unless the player
spends 1 XP to “make a lucky shot” or the GM uses GM intrusion.

Water

Being in shallow water can make it hard to move, but it doesn’t affect
combat. Being in deep water can make things difficult, and being
underwater entirely can seem as different as being on another world.

Deep Water: Being in water up to your chest (or the equivalent thereof)
hinders your attacks. Aquatic creatures ignore this modifier.

Underwater Melee Combat: For nonaquatic creatures, being completely
underwater makes attacking very difficult. Attacks with stabbing weapons
are hindered, and melee attacks with slashing or bashing weapons are
hindered by two steps. Aquatic creatures ignore these penalties.

Underwater Ranged Combat: As with melee combat, nonaquatic creatures
have problems fighting underwater. Some ranged attacks are impossible
underwater—you can’t throw things, fire a bow or crossbow, or use a
blowgun. Many firearms also do not work underwater. Attacks with weapons
that do work underwater are hindered. Ranges underwater are reduced by
one category; very-long-range weapons work only to long range,
long-range weapons work only to short range, and short-range weapons
work only to immediate range.

Moving Targets

Moving targets are harder to hit, and moving attackers have a difficult
time as well.

Target Is Moving: Attackers trying to hit a foe who is moving very fast
are hindered. (A foe moving very fast is one who is doing nothing but
running, mounted on a moving creature, riding on a vehicle or moving
conveyance, and so on.)

Attacker Is Moving: An attacker trying to make an attack while moving
under their own power (walking, running, swimming, and so on) takes no
penalties. Attacks from a moving mount or moving vehicle are hindered;
an attacker trained in riding or driving ignores this penalty.

Attacker Is Jostled: Being jostled, such as while standing on a listing
ship or a vibrating platform, makes attacking difficult. Such attacks
are hindered. Characters trained in balancing or sailing would ignore
penalties for being on a ship.

SPECIAL SITUATION: COMBAT BETWEEN NPCs

When an NPC ally of the PCs attacks another NPC, the GM can designate a
player to roll and handle it like a PC attacking. Often, the choice is
obvious. For example, a character who has a trained attack animal should
roll when their pet attacks enemies. If an NPC ally accompanying the
party leaps into the fray, that ally’s favorite PC rolls for them. NPCs
cannot apply Effort. Of course, it’s perfectly fitting (and easier) to
have the NPC ally use the cooperative action rules to aid a PC instead
of making direct attacks, or to compare the levels of the two NPCs
(higher wins).

SPECIAL SITUATION: COMBAT BETWEEN PCs

When one PC attacks another PC, the attacking character makes an attack
roll, and the other character makes a defense roll, adding any
appropriate modifiers. If the attacking PC has a skill, ability, asset,
or other effect that would ease the attack if it were made against an
NPC, the character adds 3 to the roll for each step reduction (+3 for
one step, +6 for two steps, and so on). If the attacker’s final result
is higher, the attack hits. If the defender’s result is higher,  
the attack misses. Damage is resolved normally. The GM mediates all
special effects.

SPECIAL SITUATION: AREA ATTACKS

Sometimes, an attack or effect affects an area rather than a single
target. For example, a grenade or a landslide can potentially harm or
affect everyone in the area.

In an area attack, all PCs in the area make appropriate defense rolls
against the attack to determine its effect on them. If there are any
NPCs in the area, the attacker makes a single attack roll against all of
them (one roll, not one roll per NPC) and compares it to the target
number of each NPC. If the roll is equal to or greater than the target
number of a particular NPC, the attack hits that NPC.

Some area attacks always deal at least a minimum amount of damage, even
if the attacks miss or if a PC makes a successful defense roll.

For example, consider a character who uses Shatter to attack six
cultists (level 2; target number 6) and their leader (level 4; target
number 12). The PC applies Effort to increase the damage and rolls an 11
for the attack roll. This hits the six cultists, but not the leader, so
the ability deals 3 points of damage to each of the cultists. The
description of Shatter says that applying Effort to increase the damage
also means that targets take 1 point of damage if the PC fails the
attack roll, so the leader takes 1 point of damage. In terms of what
happens in the story, the cultists are caught flat-footed by the sudden
detonation of one of their knives, but the leader ducks and is shielded
from the blast. Despite the leader’s quick moves, the blast is so
intense that a few bits of metal slice them.

SPECIAL SITUATION: ATTACKING OBJECTS

Attacking an object is rarely a matter of hitting it. Sure, you can hit
the broad side of a barn, but can you damage it? Attacking inanimate
objects with a melee weapon is a Might action. Objects have  
levels and thus target numbers. Objects have a damage track that works
like the damage track for PCs.

Intact is the default state for an object.

Minor damage is a slightly damaged state. An object with minor damage
reduces its level by 1.

Major damage is a critically damaged state. An object with major damage
is broken and no longer functions.

Destroyed is destroyed. The object is ruined, no longer functions, and
cannot be repaired.

If the Might action to damage an object is a success, the object moves
one step down the object damage track. If the Might roll exceeded the
difficulty by 2 levels, the object instead moves two steps down the
object damage track. If the Might roll exceeded the difficulty by 4
levels, the object instead moves three steps down the object damage
track. Objects with minor or major damage can be repaired, moving them
one or more steps up the object damage track.

Brittle or fragile objects, like paper or glass, decrease the effective
level of the object for the purposes of determining if it is damaged.
Hard objects, like those made of wood or stone, add 1 to the effective
level. Very hard objects, like those made of metal, add 2. (The GM may
rule that some exotic materials add 3.)

The tool or weapon used to attack the object must be at least as hard as
the object itself. Further, if the amount of damage the attack could
inflict—not modified by a special die roll—does not equal or exceed the
effective level of the object, the attack cannot damage the object no
matter what the roll.

ACTION: Activate a Special Ability

Special abilities are granted by foci, types, and flavors, or provided
by cyphers or other devices. If a special ability affects another
character in any kind of unwanted manner, it’s handled as an attack.
This is true even if the ability is normally not considered an attack.
For example, if a character has a healing touch, and their friend
doesn’t want to be healed for some reason, an attempt to heal their
unwilling friend is handled as an attack.

Plenty of special abilities do not affect another character in an
unwanted manner. For example, a PC might use Hover on themselves to
float into the air. A character with a matter-reorganizing device might
change a stone wall into glass. A character who activates a phase
changer cypher might walk through a wall. None of these requires an
attack roll (although when turning a stone wall to glass, the character
must still make a roll to successfully affect the wall).

If the character spends points to apply Effort on the attempt, they
might want to roll anyway to see if they get a major effect, which would
reduce the cost for their action.

ACTION: MOVE

As a part of another action, a character can adjust their
position—stepping back a few feet while using an ability, sliding over
in combat to take on a different opponent to help a friend, pushing
through a door they just opened, and so on. This is considered an
immediate distance, and a character can move this far as part of another
action.

In a combat situation, if a character is in a large melee, they’re
usually considered to be next to most other combatants, unless the GM
rules that they’re farther away because the melee is especially large or
the situation dictates it.

If they’re not in melee but still nearby, they are considered to be a
short distance away—usually less than 50 feet (15 m). If they’re farther
away than that but still involved in the combat, they are considered to
be a long distance away, usually 50 to 100 feet (15 to 30 m), or
possibly even a very long distance away, usually more than 100 feet to
500 feet (30 to 150 m).

In a round, as an action, a character can make a short move. In this
case, they are doing nothing but moving up to about 50 feet (15 m). Some
terrain or situations will change the distance a character can move, but
generally, making a short move is considered to be a difficulty 0
action. No roll is needed; they just get where they’re going as their
action.

A character can try to make a long move—up to 100 feet (30 m) or so—in
one round. This is a Speed task with a difficulty of 4. As with any
action, they can use skills, assets, or Effort to ease the task.
Terrain, obstacles, or other circumstances can hinder the task. A
successful roll means the character moved the distance safely. Failure
means that at some point during the move, they stop or stumble (the GM
determines where this happens).

A character can also try to make a short move and take another
(relatively simple) physical action, like make an attack. As with the
attempt to make a long move, this is a Speed task with a difficulty of
4, and failure means that the character stops at some point, slipping or
stumbling or otherwise getting held up.

Long-Term Movement

When talking about movement in terms of traveling rather than
round-by-round action, typical characters can travel on a road about 20
miles (32 km) per day, averaging about 3 miles (5 km) per hour,
including a few stops. When traveling overland, they can move about 12
miles (19 km) per day, averaging 2 miles (3 km) per hour, again with
some stops. Mounted characters, such as those on horseback, can go twice
as far. Other modes of travel (cars, airplanes, hovercraft, sailing
ships, and so on) have their own rates of movement.

Movement Modifiers

Different environments affect movement in different ways.

Rough Terrain: A surface that’s considered rough terrain is covered in
loose stones or other material, uneven or with unsure footing, unsteady,
or a surface that requires movement across a narrow space, such as a
cramped corridor or a slender ledge. Stairs are also considered rough
terrain. Rough terrain does not slow normal movement on a round-by-round
basis, but hinders move rolls. Rough terrain cuts long-term movement
rates in half.

Difficult Terrain: Difficult terrain is an area filled with challenging
obstacles—water up to waist height, a very steep slope, an especially
narrow ledge, slippery ice, a foot or more of snow, a space so small
that one must crawl through it, and so on. Difficult terrain hinders
move rolls and halves movement on a  
round-by-round basis. This means that a short move is about 25 feet (8
m), and a long move is about 50 feet (15 m). Difficult terrain reduces  
long-term movement to a third of its normal rate.

Water: Deep water, in which a character is mostly or entirely submerged,
hinders move rolls  
and reduces round-by-round and long-term movement to one quarter its
normal rate. This means that a short move is about 12 feet(4 m),  
and a long move is about 25 feet (7.5 m). Characters trained in swimming
halve their movement only while in deep water.

Low Gravity: Movement in low gravity is easier but not much faster. All
move rolls are eased.

High Gravity: In an environment of high gravity, treat all moving
characters as if they were in difficult terrain. Characters trained in  
high-gravity maneuvering negate this penalty. High gravity reduces
long-term movement to a third of its normal rate.

Zero Gravity: In an environment without gravity, characters cannot move
normally. Instead, they must push off from a surface and succeed at a
Might roll to move (the difficulty is equal to one-quarter the distance
traveled in feet). Without a surface to push off from, a character
cannot move. Unless the character’s movement takes them to a stable
object that they can grab or land against, they continue to drift in
that direction each round, traveling half the distance of the initial
push.

Special Situation: A Chase

When a PC is chasing an NPC or vice versa, the player should attempt a
Speed action, with the difficulty based on the NPC’s level. If the PC
succeeds at the roll, they catch the NPC (if chasing), or they get away
(if chased). In terms of the story, this one-roll mechanic can be the
result of a long chase over many rounds.

Alternatively, if the GM wants to play out a long chase, the character
can make many rolls (perhaps one per level of the NPC) to finish the
pursuit successfully. For every failure, the PC must make another
success, and if they ever have more failures than successes, the PC
fails to catch the NPC (if chasing) or is caught (if chased). As with
combat, the GM is encouraged to describe the results of these rolls with
flavor. A success might mean the PC has rounded a corner and gained some
distance. A failure might mean that a basket of fruit topples over in
front of them, slowing them down. Vehicle chases are handled similarly.

ACTION: WAIT

You can wait to react to another character’s action.

You decide what action will trigger your action, and if the triggering
action happens, you get to take your action first (unless going first
wouldn’t make sense, like attacking a foe before they come into view).
For example, if an orc threatens you with a halberd, on your turn you
can decide to wait, stating “If it stabs at me, I’m going to slash it
with my sword.” On the orc’s turn, it stabs, so you make your sword
attack before that happens.

Waiting is also a good way to deal with a ranged attacker who rises from
behind cover, fires an attack, and ducks back down. You could say “I
wait to see them pop up from behind cover and then I shoot them.”

(Waiting is also a useful tool for cooperative actions (see below).)

ACTION: DEFEND

Defending is a special action that only PCs can do, and only in response
to being attacked. In other words, an NPC uses its action to attack,
which forces a PC to make a defense roll. This is handled like any other
kind of action, with circumstances, skill, assets, and Effort all
potentially coming into play. Defending is a special kind of action in
that it does not happen on the PC’s turn. It’s never an action that a
player decides to take; it’s always a reaction to an attack. A PC can
take a defense action when attacked (on the attacking NPC’s turn) and
still take another action on their own turn.

The type of defense roll depends on the type of attack. If a foe attacks
a character with an axe, they can use Speed to duck or block it with
what they’re holding. If they’re struck by a poisoned dart, they can use
a Might action to resist its effects. If a psi-worm attempts to control
their mind, they can use Intellect to fend off the intrusion.

Sometimes an attack provokes two defense actions. For example, a
poisonous reptile tries to bite a PC. They try to dodge the bite with a
Speed action. If they fail, they take damage from the bite, and they
must also attempt a Might action to resist the poison’s effects.

If a character does not know an attack is coming, usually they can still
make a defense roll, but they can’t add modifiers (including the
modifier from a shield), and they can’t use any skill or Effort to ease
the task. If circumstances warrant—such as if the attacker is right next
to the character—the GM might rule that the surprise attack simply hits.

A character can always choose to forgo a defense action, in which case
the attack automatically hits.

Some abilities (such as the Countermeasures special ability) may allow
you to do something special as a defense action.

ACTION: DO SOMETHING ELSE

Players can try anything they can think of, although that doesn’t mean
anything is possible. The GM sets the difficulty—that’s their primary
role in the game. Still, guided by the bounds of logic, players and GMs
will find all manner of actions and options that aren’t covered by a
rule. That’s a good thing.

Players should not feel constrained by the game mechanics when taking
actions. Skills are not required to attempt an action. Someone who’s
never picked a lock can still try. The GM might hinder the task, but the
character can still attempt the action.

Thus, players and GMs can return to the beginning of this chapter and
look at the most basic expression of the rules. A player wants to take
an action. The GM decides, on a scale of 1 to 10, how difficult that
task is and what stat it uses. The player determines whether they have
anything that might modify the difficulty and considers whether to apply
Effort. Once the final determination is made, they roll to see if their
character succeeds. It’s as easy as that.

As further guidance, the following are some of the more common actions a
player might take.

(Players are encouraged to come up with their own ideas for what their
characters do rather than looking at a list of possible actions. That’s
why there is a “do something else” action. PCs are not pieces on a game
board—they are people in a story. And like real people, they can try
anything they can think of. (Succeeding is another matter entirely.) The
task difficulty system provides GMs with the tools they need to
adjudicate anything the players come up with.)

CLIMBING

When a character climbs, the GM sets a difficulty based on the surface
being climbed. Climbing is like moving through difficult terrain: the
move roll is hindered and the movement is half speed. Unusual
circumstances, such as climbing while under fire, pose additional step
penalties.

CLIMBING Difficulty

|                |                                                     |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Difficulty** | **Surface**                                         |
| 2              | Surface with lots of handholds                      |
| 3              | Stone wall or similar surface (a few handholds)     |
| 4              | Crumbling or slippery surface                       |
| 5              | Smooth stone wall or similar surface                |
| 6              | Metal wall or similar surface                       |
| 8              | Smooth, horizontal surface (climber is upside down) |
| 10             | Glass wall or similar surface                       |

COOPERATIVE ACTIONS

There are many ways multiple characters can work together. None of these
options, however, can be used at the same time by the same characters.

Helping: If you use your action to help someone with a task, you ease
the task. If you have an inability in a task, your help has no effect.
If you use your action to help someone with a task that you are trained
or specialized in, the task is eased by two steps. Help is considered an
asset, and someone receiving help usually can’t gain more than two
assets on a single task if that help is provided by another character.

For example, if Scott is trying to climb a steep incline and Sarah (who
is trained in climbing) spends her turn helping him, Scott’s task is
eased by two steps.

Sometimes you can help by performing a task that complements what
another person is attempting. If your complementary action succeeds, you
ease the other person’s task. For example, if Scott tries to persuade a
ship captain to let him on board, Sarah could try to supplement Scott’s
words with a flattering lie about the captain (a deception action), a
display of knowledge about the region where the ship is headed (a
geography action), or a direct threat to the captain (an intimidation
action). If Sarah’s roll is a success, Scott’s persuasion task is eased.

Distraction: When a character uses their turn to distract a foe, that
foe’s attacks are hindered for one round. Multiple characters
distracting a foe have no greater effect than a single character doing
so—a foe is either distracted or not. A distraction might be yelling a
challenge, firing a warning shot, or a similar activity that doesn’t
harm the foe.

Draw the Attack: When an NPC attacks a character, another PC can
prominently present themselves, shout taunts, and move to try to get the
foe to attack them instead. In most cases, this action succeeds without
a roll—the opponent attacks the prominent PC instead of their
companions. In other cases, such as with intelligent or determined foes,
the prominent character must succeed at an Intellect action to draw the
attack. If that Intellect action is successful, the foe attacks the
prominent character, whose defenses are hindered by two steps. Two
characters attempting to draw an attack at the same time cancel each
other out.

(Two characters attempting to draw an attack at the same time cancel
each other out.)

Take the Attack: A character can use their action to throw themselves in
front of a foe’s successful attack to save a nearby comrade. The attack
automatically succeeds against the sacrificial character, and it deals 1
additional point of damage. A character cannot willingly take more than
one attack each round in this way.

CRAFTING, BUILDING, AND REPAIRING

Crafting is a tricky topic in the Cypher System because the same rules
that govern building a spear also cover repairing a machine that can
take you into hyperspace. Normally, the level of the item determines the
difficulty of creating or repairing it as well as the time required. For
cyphers, artifacts, other items that require specialized knowledge, or
items unique to a world or species other than your own (such as a
Martian tripod walker), add 5 to the item’s level to determine the
difficulty of building or repairing it.

Sometimes, if the item is artistic in nature, the GM will add to the
difficulty and time required. For example, a crude wooden stool might be
hammered together in an hour. A beautiful finished piece might take a
week or longer and would require more skill on the part of the crafter.

The GM is free to overrule some attempts at creation, building, or
repair, requiring that the character have a certain level of skill,
proper tools and materials, and so forth.

A level 0 object requires no skill to make and is easily found in most
locations. Sling stones and firewood are level 0 items—producing them is
routine. Making a torch from spare wood and oil-soaked cloth is simple,
so it’s a level 1 object. Making an arrow or a spear is fairly standard
but not simple, so it’s a level 2 object.

Generally speaking, a device to be crafted requires materials equal to
its level and all the levels below it. So a level 5 device requires
level 5 material, level 4 material, level 3 material, level 2 material,
and level 1 material (and, technically, level 0 material).

The GM and players can gloss over much of the crafting details, if
desired. Gathering all the materials to make a mundane item might not be
worth playing out—but then again, it might be. For example, making a
wooden spear in a forest isn’t very interesting, but what if the
characters have to make a spear in a treeless desert? Finding the
wreckage of something made of wood or forcing a PC to fashion a spear
out of the bones of a large beast could be interesting situations.

The time required to create an item is up to the GM, but the guidelines
in the crafting table are a good starting point. Generally, repairing an
item takes somewhere between half the creation time and the full
creation time, depending on the item, the aspect that needs repairing,
and the circumstances. For example, if creating an item takes one hour,
repairing it takes thirty minutes to one hour.

Sometimes a GM will allow a rush job if the circumstances warrant it.
This is different than using skill to reduce the time required. In this
case, the quality of the item is affected. Let’s say that a character
needs to create a tool that will cut through solid steel with a laser (a
level 7 item), but they have to do it in one day. The GM might allow it,
but the device might be extremely volatile, inflicting damage on the
user, or it might work only once. The device is still considered a level
7 item to create in all other respects. Sometimes the GM will rule that
reducing the time is not possible. For example, a single human can’t
make a chainmail vest in one hour without some kind of machine to help.

Possible crafting skills include:

Armoring

Bowyering/fletching

Chemistry

Computer science

Electronics

Engines

Genetic engineering

Glassblowing

Gunsmithing

Leatherworking

Metalworking

Neural engineering

Weaponsmithing

Woodcrafting

Characters might try to make a cypher, an artifact, or an alien psionic
starship do something other than its intended function. Sometimes, the
GM will simply declare the task impossible. You can’t turn a vial of
healing elixir into a two-way communicator. But most of the time, there
is a chance of success.

That said, tinkering with weird stuff is not easy. Obviously, the
difficulty varies from situation to situation, but difficulties starting
at 7 are not unreasonable. The time, tools, and training required would
be similar to the time, tools, and training needed to repair a device.
If the tinkering results in a long-term benefit for the character—such
as creating an artifact that they can use—the GM should require them to
spend XP to make it.

(Circumstances really matter. For example, sewing a dress by hand might
take five times as long (or more) as using a sewing machine.)

(The GM is free to overrule some attempts at creation, building, or
repair, requiring that the character have a certain level of skill,
proper tools and materials, and so forth.)

(Obviously, what is considered “weird stuff ” will vary from setting to
setting, and sometimes the concept might not apply at all. But many
times, there will be something in the setting that is too strange, too
alien, too powerful, or too dangerous for PCs to mess around with (or at
least mess around with easily). Einstein may have been extraordinary,
but that doesn’t mean he could reverse-engineer a teleporter made in
another dimension.)

| 10         | Technological item (something from beyond Earth)                                                       | Many years            |

GUARDING

In a combat situation, a character can stand guard as their action. They
do not make attacks, but all their defense tasks are eased. Further, if
an NPC tries to get by them or take an action that they are guarding
against, the character can attempt an eased Speed action based on the
level of the NPC. Success means the NPC is prevented from taking the
action; the NPC’s action that turn is wasted. This is useful for
blocking a doorway, guarding a friend, and so forth.

If an NPC is standing guard, use the same procedure, but to get past the
guard, the PC attempts a hindered Speed action against the NPC. For
example, Diana is an NPC human with a level 3 bodyguard. The bodyguard
uses their action to guard Diana. If a PC wants to attack Diana, the PC
first must succeed at a difficulty 4 Speed task to get past the guard.
If the PC succeeds, they can make their attack normally.

HEALING

You can administer aid through bandaging and other succor, attempting to
heal each patient once per day. This healing restores points to a stat
Pool of your choice. Decide how many points you want to heal, and then
make an Intellect action with a difficulty equal to that number. For
example, if you want to heal someone for 3 points, that’s a difficulty 3
task with a target number of 9.

INTERACTING WITH CREATURES

The level of the creature determines the target number, just as with
combat. Thus, bribing a guard works much like punching them or affecting
them with an ability. This is true of persuading someone, intimidating
someone, calming a wild beast, or anything of the kind. Interaction is
an Intellect task. Interacting usually requires a common language or
some other way to communicate. Learning new languages is the same as
learning a new skill.

JUMPING

Decide how far you want to jump, and that sets the difficulty of your
Might roll. For a standing jump, subtract 4 from the distance in feet to
determine the difficulty of the jump. For example, jumping 10 feet (3 m)
has a difficulty of 6.

If you run an immediate distance before jumping, it counts as an asset,
easing the jump.

If you run a short distance before jumping, divide the jump distance (in
feet) by 2 and then subtract 4 to determine the difficulty of the jump.
Because you’re running an immediate distance (and then some), you also
count your running as an asset. For example, jumping a distance of 20
feet (6 m) with a short running start has a difficulty of 5 (20 feet
divided by 2 is 10, minus 4 is 6, minus 1 for running an immediate
distance).

For a vertical jump, the distance you clear (in feet) is equal to the
difficulty of the jumping task. If you run an immediate distance, it
counts as an asset, easing the jump.

(There’s nothing wrong with the GM simply assigning a difficulty level
to a jump without worrying about the precise distance. The rules here
are just so everyone has some guidelines.)

LOOKING OR LISTENING

Generally, the GM will describe any sight or sound that’s not
purposefully difficult to detect. But if you want to look for a hidden
enemy, search for a secret panel, or listen for someone sneaking up on
you, make an Intellect roll. If it’s a creature, its level determines
the difficulty of your roll. If it’s something else, the GM determines
the difficulty of your roll.

MOVING A HEAVY OBJECT

You can push or pull something very heavy and move it an immediate
distance as your action.

The weight of the object determines the difficulty of the Might roll to
move it; every 50 pounds (23 kg) hinders the task by one step. So moving
something that weighs 150 pounds (68 kg) is difficulty 3, and moving
something that weighs 400 pounds (180 kg) is difficulty 8. If you can
ease the task to 0, you can move a heavy object up to a short distance
as your action.

OPERATING OR DISABLING A DEVICE, OR PICKING A LOCK

As with figuring out a device, the level of the device usually
determines the difficulty of the Intellect roll. Unless a device is very
complex, the GM will often rule that once you figure it out, no roll is
needed to operate it except under special circumstances. So if the PCs
figure out how to use a hovercraft, they can operate it. If they are
attacked, they might need to roll to ensure that they don’t crash the
vehicle into a wall while trying to avoid being hit.

Unlike operating a device, disabling a device or picking a lock usually
require rolls. These actions often involve special tools and assume that
the character is not trying to destroy the device or lock. (A PC who
*is* attempting to destroy it probably should make a Might roll to smash
it rather than a Speed or Intellect roll requiring patience and
know-how.)

RIDING OR PILOTING

If you’re riding an animal that’s trained to be a mount, or driving or
piloting a vehicle, you don’t need to make a roll to do something
routine such as going from point A to point B (just as you wouldn’t need
to make a roll to walk there). However, staying mounted during a fight
or doing something tricky with a vehicle requires a Speed roll to
succeed. A saddle or other appropriate gear is an asset and eases the
task.

RIDING OR PILOTING Difficulty

|                |                                                                                                           |

| 5              | Making a long jump with a vehicle not intended to go airborne (like a car) and remaining in control       |

SNEAKING

The difficulty of sneaking by a creature is determined by its level.
Sneaking is a Speed roll. Moving at half speed eases the sneaking task.
Appropriate camouflage or other gear may count as an asset and ease the
task, as will dim lighting conditions and having plenty of things to
hide behind.

SWIMMING

If you’re simply swimming from one place to another, such as across a
calm river or lake, use the standard movement rules, noting the fact
that your character is in deep water. However, sometimes, special
circumstances require a Might roll to make progress while swimming, such
as when trying to avoid a current or being dragged into a whirlpool.

UNDERSTANDING, IDENTIFYING, OR REMEMBERING

When characters try to identify or figure out how to use a device, the
level of the device determines the difficulty. For a bit of knowledge,
the GM determines the difficulty.

|            |                                         |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|

| 7          | Knowledge very few people possess       |
| 10         | Completely lost knowledge               |

VEHICULAR MOVEMENT

Vehicles move just like creatures. Each has a movement rate, which
indicates how far it can move in a round. Most vehicles require a
driver, and when moving, they usually require that the driver spends
every action controlling the movement. This is a routine task that
rarely requires a roll. Any round not spent driving the vehicle hinders
the task in the next round and precludes any change in speed or
direction. In other words, driving down the road normally is difficulty
0. Spending an action to retrieve a backpack from the back seat means
that in the following round, the driver must attempt a difficulty 1
task. If they instead use their action to pull a handgun from the
backpack, in the next round the difficulty to drive will be 2, and so
on. Failure results are based on the situation but might involve a
collision or something similar.

In a vehicular chase, drivers attempt Speed actions just like in a
regular chase, but the task may be based either on the level of the
driver (modified by the level and movement rate of the vehicle) or on
the level of the vehicle (modified by the level of the driver). So if a
PC driving a typical car is chasing a level 3 NPC driving a level 5
sports car, the PC would make three chase rolls with a difficulty of 5.
If the PC’s car is a souped-up custom vehicle, it might grant the PC an
asset in the chase. If the PC is not in a car at all, but riding a
bicycle, it might hinder the chase rolls by two or three steps, or the
GM might simply rule that it’s impossible.

VEHICULAR COMBAT

Much of the time, a fight between foes in cars, boats, or other vehicles
is just like any other combat situation. The combatants probably have
cover and are moving fast. Attacks to disable a vehicle or a portion of
it are based on the level of the vehicle. If the vehicle is an armored
car or a tank, all attacks are likely aimed at the vehicle, which has a
level and probably an appropriate Armor rating, not unlike a creature.

The only time this isn’t true is with battles where only vehicles and
not characters are involved. Thus, if the PCs are in a shootout with
bank robbers and both groups are in cars, use the standard rules.
However, battles between starships of various kinds—from gigantic
capital ships to single-pilot fighters—are a frequent occurrence in
far-future science fiction settings. A submarine battle between two deep
sea craft could be quite exciting. Characters in a modern-day game might
find themselves in a tank fight. If PCs are involved in combat in which
they are entirely enclosed in vehicles (so that it’s not really the
characters fighting, but the vehicles), use the following quick and easy
guidelines.

On this scale, combat between vehicles isn’t like traditional combat.
Don’t worry about health, Armor, or anything like that. Instead, just
compare the levels of the vehicles involved. If the PCs’ vehicle has the
higher level, the difference in levels is how many steps the PCs’ attack
and defense rolls are eased. If the PCs’ vehicle has the lower level,
their rolls are hindered. If the levels are the same, there is no
modification.

These attack and defense rolls are modified by skill and Effort, as
usual. Some vehicles also have superior weapons, which ease the attack
(since there is no “damage” amount to worry about), but this
circumstance is probably uncommon in this abstract system and should not
affect the difficulty by more than one or maybe two steps. Further, if
two vehicles coordinate their attack against one vehicle, the attack is
eased. If three or more vehicles coordinate, the attack is eased by two
steps.

The attacker must try to target a specific system on or portion of an
enemy vehicle. This hinders the attack based on the system or portion
targeted.

That’s a lot of modifications. But it’s not really that hard. Let’s look
at an example of a space battle. A PC in a small level 2 fighter attacks
a level 4 frigate. Since the frigate is level 4, the difficulty of the
attack starts at 4. But the attacking craft is weaker than the defender,
so the attack is hindered equal to the difference in their levels (2).
The fighter pilot must make a difficulty 6 attack on the frigate.
However, the fighter is trying to swoop in and damage the frigate’s
drive, which hinders the attack by another three steps, for a total
difficulty of 9. If the fighter pilot is trained in space combat, they
reduce the difficulty to 8, but it’s still impossible without help. So
let’s say that two other PCs—also in level 2 fighters—join in and
coordinate their attack. Three ships coordinating an attack on one
target eases the task by two steps, resulting in a final difficulty of
6. Still, the attacking PC would be wise to use Effort.

Then the frigate retaliates, and the PC needs to make a defense roll.
The level difference between the ships (2) means the PC’s defense is
hindered by two steps, so the difficulty of the PC’s defense roll starts
out at 6. But the frigate tries to take out the fighter’s weapons,
hindering their attack (easing the PC’s defense) by two steps. Thus, the
PC needs to succeed at a difficulty 4 task or lose their main weapons
systems.

It’s important to remember that a failed attack doesn’t always mean a
miss. The target ship might rock and reel from the hit, but the bulk of
the damage was absorbed by the shields, so there’s no significant
damage.

This bare-bones system should allow the GM and players to flesh out
exciting encounters involving the whole group. For example, perhaps
while one PC pilots a ship, another mans the guns, and another
frantically attempts to repair damage to the maneuvering thrusters
before they crash into the space station they’re trying to defend.

(During a vehicular battle, particularly a space battle, there’s a lot
of chatter about shields failing, hull integrity, being outmaneuvered,
coming in too fast, and whatnot. These sorts of details are great, but
they’re all flavor, so they’re represented in the rules generally,
rather than specifically.)

(For more details about vehicles, refer to the Genre chapter.)

(Training in driving makes the character practiced in using a vehicle as
a weapon. If the vehicle is used to run over a victim or ram an enemy
vehicle, treat a motorcycle as a medium weapon and treat a car or truck
as a heavy weapon.)

MAGICAL RULES MODULE

CRAFTING MAGIC ITEMS

Potions, scrolls, and other one-use items are cyphers, and
longer-lasting items are generally artifacts.

CRAFTING CYPHERS 

1\. Choose Cypher Level. Creating a low-level cypher is easier than
creating a high-level one. The character decides what level of cypher
they’re trying to create, which must be in the level range for the
cypher as listed in the Cypher System Reference Document. Note that some
cyphers have the same effect no matter what level they are, so the
character could make crafting easier by creating the lowest-level
version of that cypher, but the GM is always able to rule that a
particular cypher must be crafted at a certain level or higher for it to
work. In particular, a stim is very strong for its level range, and
should always be treated as a level 6 cypher when crafted by a PC. 

2\. Determine Materials. Just as crafting an axe requires iron and wood,
crafting a magical cypher requires strange and exotic materials—powdered
gems, ink from monsters, mysterious herbs, and so on. The level of the
cypher determines how expensive these materials are, according to the
following table.

| Cypher Level | Materials Cost           |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| 1            | One inexpensive item     |
| 2            | Two inexpensive items    |
| 3            | One moderate item        |
| 4            | Two moderate items       |
| 5            | Three moderate items     |
| 6            | One expensive item       |
| 7            | Two expensive items      |
| 8            | Three expensive items    |
| 9            | One very expensive item  |
| 10           | Two very expensive items |

3\. Assess Difficulty. The difficulty of a magic item crafting task is
always equal to 1 + the level of the cypher. The crafter can reduce the
assessed difficulty of a crafting task with skill training (such as
being trained or specialized in brewing potions or scribing scrolls),
assets, special abilities provided by their focus or type, and so on.
Using a formula, recipe, or other guideline for a specific cypher counts
as an asset for this purpose. Because this is an activity requiring
special knowledge, it is not possible for a character with no skill (or
with an inability in this skill) to do this sort of crafting; the
character cannot attempt the task at all. 

4\. Determine Time to Craft. The amount of time it takes to craft a
magical cypher is determined by the assessed difficulty, so decreasing
the assessed difficulty not only means the character is more likely to
succeed, but also that they have to spend less time on crafting it. See
the table below. 

For any time in excess of nine hours, the process is assumed to have
stages where the character is not actively working on it, just checking
on it occasionally to make sure everything is going as planned— allowing
the base ingredients of a potion to cook for a few hours, stirring to
make sure the ingredients don’t congeal, allowing ink on a scroll to
dry, and so on. In other words, the character is able to perform other
actions in the vicinity of the crafting (such as studying, resting,
eating, and so on), but couldn’t craft on the road or in the middle of a
dungeon.

| Assessed Difficulty | Time to Craft |
|---------------------|---------------|
| 1                   | Ten minutes   |
| 2                   | One hour      |
| 3                   | Four hours    |
| 4                   | Nine hours    |
| 5                   | One day       |
| 6                   | Two days      |
| 7                   | One week      |
| 8                   | Three weeks   |
| 9                   | Two months    |
| 10                  | Six months    |

5\. Complete Subtasks. The crafting character must complete multiple
subtasks that are steps toward finishing the process. The number of
subtasks required is equal to the assessed difficulty of the crafting
task attempted. So a crafting task assessed as difficulty 5 requires
five subtask successes. 

The difficulty of each individual subtask begins at 1 and increases by
one step for each remaining subtask, until the crafter succeeds on the
final, highest-difficulty subtask. Generally, subtask attempts occur at
equally divided intervals over the course of the full time required to
craft the item. 

If at any point the crafter fails on a subtask, the item isn’t ruined.
Instead, the character only wasted the time spent on that subtask, and
can spend that much time again and then try to succeed at that same
subtask. If the crafter fails twice in a row on the same subtask, the
character can continue crafting, but in addition to losing another
interval of crafting time, more crafting material (equal to one of the
kind of item needed to craft it) is destroyed in a mishap and must be
replaced before crafting can continue.

A player may ask to apply Effort to each subtask. Applying Effort is
something they do in the moment, not over the course of days or weeks.
Generally speaking, Effort cannot be applied to any crafting task or
subtask that exceeds one day

CRAFTING ARTIFACTS

Crafting an artifact is similar to choosing a new type or focus
ability—the character has many to choose from, they select the one that
best fits their intention, and thereafter they can use the artifact much
like they’d use any of their other character abilities. The main
difference is that most artifacts don’t cost Pool points to activate,
and character abilities don’t have a depletion stat that eventually
removes the item from play. Crafting artifacts is handled as a long-term
benefit of character advancement; the character and GM agree on the
artifact to be crafted, and the character spends 3 XP. If the item is
fairly simple, the GM can skip the crafting details and just say that
after a period of time, the PC creates the artifact. For an item that
significantly alters gameplay—granting the character vast telepathic
powers or giving them the ability to teleport at will—the GM can give
the item an assessed difficulty equal to 3 + the artifact level and
require the character to follow the crafting steps for creating a
magical cypher. Crafting this kind of artifact takes up to five times as
many materials and up to twenty times as long as crafting a cypher of
the same assessed difficulty

RITUAL MAGIC

TIME

Ritual magic has two aspects related to time: how long it takes to
prepare the ritual, and how long it takes to perform it. The preparation
time is how long it takes to get ready to perform the ritual. The
performance time is how long the ritual takes from start to finish, once
the preparations (if any) are complete. 

DIFFICULTY AND SUBTASKS

Completing a ritual has an overall difficulty level, usually equal to
the level of the challenge. Sometimes there isn’t a clear idea of what
level the challenge should be— teleporting a group of people to a nearby
city and raising a person from the dead don’t have an obvious task
level. In these cases, the GM should choose a level for the ritual based
on what would make an interesting experience for the players. Instead of
having the success or failure of this sort of magic come down to one
roll, ritual magic lets the GM build tension by requiring the players to
make rolls for multiple subtasks. The subtasks start at difficulty 1,
and the subtask difficulty increases by 1 each time until the players
make a final roll at the highest difficulty. A ritual with an overall
difficulty of 4 has four subtasks, with the first one at difficulty 1,
the second at difficulty 2, the third at 3, and the last one at 4. 

If at any point the PC fails a subtask, the ritual isn’t automatically
ruined, but it costs time—a failure means the time spent on that subtask
was wasted, but the character can spend that much time again and try to
succeed at that same subtask. The GM may decide that later attempts at
that subtask are hindered, or that a certain number of failures during
the ritual (perhaps equal to half the ritual’s overall level) means the
whole thing needs to be started again. Skills, assets, and other special
abilities can ease subtasks just like they do with any other task (which
might make some of the subtasks routine and not require a roll at all).
Characters may apply Effort to each subtask. 

POOL INVESTMENT

Some rituals might require the PCs to spend points from their Pools on
each subtask, with Might representing blood or vitality, Speed
representing energy, and Intellect representing will or sanity. Multiple
PCs involved in the ritual could collectively contribute to this cost
(and if a ritual costs many points, spreading out the cost in this way
may be necessary to prevent a participating PC from dying during the
ritual). 

ACCELERATED PERFORMANCE

The GM may allow a character to speed up a ritual, reducing the time
required for one or more subtasks. Generally, reducing a subtask’s time
by half should hinder the subtask, and reducing it by half again
(reducing the time needed to a quarter of the normal amount) should
hinder the subtask by an additional step (two steps total). The minimum
amount of time for a subtask is 1 round (unless the subtask is routine,
in which case the GM may allow it to take no time at all).

EXAMPLE RITUALS 

The following are examples of common magical rituals suitable for many
fantasy settings. Specific details of a ritual may vary depending on
what the characters are trying to accomplish; for example, a ritual to
ask a demon for a favor might be similar to one used to ask an angel,
but the exact details are probably very different. Everything listed in
a ritual is merely a suggestion, and the GM should alter, add, or remove
whatever they like to suit their campaign.

UNDERSTANDING THE EXAMPLES

Each ritual is described in the following format. 

Level: The overall level of the ritual, which determines how many
subtasks it has.

Time: The preparation time (if any) and performance time. 

Roles: Things other characters can do to participate and help. 

Side Effects: Negative consequences for failed rolls or GM intrusions.  
Reagents: Resources that can help success. 

Pool: What kind of Pool points the ritual costs. 

Other Assets: Kinds of abilities that can help success.

BESEECH

Call upon a powerful supernatural entity such as a deity, archangel,
demon lord, or ancient elemental to ask for a favor that the entity can
and is likely to do (nothing it would ethically oppose). If the ritual
is successful, the entity makes its attention known, such as by
manifesting as a light, noise, or visible spirit. It may ask for more
information, for a task or favor in return, or for a service to be named
later. The entity is not compelled to do the favor; the ritual merely
gains its attention and gives the characters the opportunity to speak
their case. 

Level: The level of the entity 

Time: Four hours of preparation, one hour of performance 

Roles: Chanting, lighting candles, holding gifts/reagents 

Side Effects: Curse, hallucination, prerequisite quest (a challenge or
task the characters must perform before the entity will consider
answering) 

Reagents: Scroll giving the history of and important details about the
entity, offerings of gratitude or appeasement 

Pool: Might or Intellect 

Other Assets: Knowledge or control of similar entities

Beseech only draws the entity’s attention; the various Conjure rituals
bring the summoned entity bodily to the ritual space to talk in person.

CONJURE THE DEAD

Summons the spirit of a dead person or creature (commonly called a
“ghost”), which appears in the summoning circle prepared for the ritual.
The spirit remains there for about a minute, during which time the
summoners can interrogate them or persuade them to share information.
The spirit usually wants something in return (such as messages conveyed
to the living or unfulfilled tasks completed). If the characters don’t
comply, they must magically threaten or compel the spirit to obey. 

Level: The level of the dead spirit 

Time: Three hours of preparation, one hour of performance 

Roles: Chanting, holding hands in a circle, manipulating a spirit
device 

Side Effects: Haunting, possession 

Reagents: Mementos of the spirit’s life, the spirit’s former physical
remains, a person or creature to possess 

Pool: Might or Intellect 

Other Assets: Knowledge or control of similar entities, religious or
cultural connections, secret name of the spirit 

A ghost remembers much of its life, including whether it knows, likes,
or hates the people summoning it, and will act accordingly.

CONJURE DEMON 

Summons a demon (an evil supernatural creature from another dimension,
plane, or realm) to command or convince it to perform a task. The demon
is primitive and bestial, not a creature of great wits and charm. The
demon remains there for about a minute, during which time the summoners
must bargain with or command it to perform a deed that takes no longer
than an hour and requires it to travel no more than about 50 miles (80
km)—spying, murder, and destruction of property are common tasks.
Usually the demon has to be threatened or magically coerced into
obeying. If the summoners fail to get it to comply, it makes one attack
against them and then returns to wherever it came from (and probably
bears a grudge for the unwanted summoning). 

Level: The level of the demon 

Time: Three hours of preparation, one hour of performance 

Roles: Bloodletting, chanting, lighting candles, holding gifts/reagents,
tracing the summoning circle 

Side Effects: Aggression, bad smell, curse, equipment damage or theft,
possession 

Reagents: Blood; meat; magical inks or paints for a summoning circle;
contracts; a person to possess; objects representing anger, destruction,
or hatred (according to the desired service) 

Pool: Might or Intellect 

Other Assets: Knowledge or control of similar entities, secret name of
the demon

CONJURE DEVIL 

Summons a devil (an evil supernatural creature from another dimension,
plane, or realm) to command or convince it to perform a task. The devil
remains there for about a minute, during which time the summoners must
bargain with or command it to perform a deed that takes no longer than
an hour and requires the devil to travel no more than about 50 miles (80
km)—spying, stealing, guarding, and murdering are common tasks. The
devil usually wants something in return (even if just an agreement for a
later favor); otherwise, the characters must threaten it or have some
way to force it to obey. If the characters fail to strike a bargain, the
devil returns to wherever it came from (and probably is annoyed at the
interruption).

Level: The level of the devil 

Time: Three hours of preparation, one hour of performance 

Roles: Bloodletting, chanting, lighting candles, holding gifts/reagents,
tracing the summoning circle 

Side Effects: Bad smell, curse, infernal mark, possession

Reagents: Blood; magical inks or paints for a summoning circle;
contracts; a person to possess; objects representing betrayal,
deception, or greed (according to the desired service) 

Pool: Might or Intellect 

Other Assets: Knowledge or control of similar entities, secret name of
the devil 

CONJURE ELEMENTAL 

Summons a primordial elemental spirit of air, earth, fire, or water,
which appears in a physical form. The elemental remains for about a
minute, during which time the characters must attempt to bribe,
threaten, or bargain with it. An elemental is usually summoned to do
something that takes no longer than an hour and requires it to travel no
more than about 50 miles (80 km)—attack, guard, and scout are common
tasks. The elemental typically wants something in return for its
service, usually a gift or bribe appropriate to its nature—incense for
air, gems for earth, oil for fire, salts for water, and so on. If the
summoners can’t come to an agreement with the elemental, it might make
one attack before it leaves. 

Level: The level of the elemental 

Time: Three hours of preparation, one hour of performance 

Roles: Chanting, music, using ceremonial objects, holding
gifts/reagents, tracing the summoning circle 

Side Effects: Damage, weakness toward one kind of attack 

Reagents: Gifts (black powder, gems, ice, incense, oil, salt, soil,
water, wood), destroying opposing items or creatures 

Pool: Might, Speed, or Intellect, depending on the kind of elemental 

Other Assets: Elemental power, knowledge or control of similar entities,
nature magic, secret name of the elemental

Elementals are simple creatures whose interests and attentions are
focused on themselves and their element. Flattery and playing up their
strengths are the key to bargaining with them.

CONSECRATION 

Wards a location against evil influences and unwanted magic for a year
and a day. The ritual affects an area up to a very long distance across.
Evil creatures and magical effects of less than the ritual’s level can’t
enter the area or use abilities against it. If the PCs are warded out of
the designated area, they must make an Intellect defense roll to enter
it (and another each minute while within the area, or retreat) and all
their actions inside or targeted within the area are hindered by two
steps. 

Level: The level of the effects to protect against 

Time: One hour of preparation, two hours of performance 

Roles: Drawing lines and symbols along the border, chanting, calling out
local features (with candles, runestones, or other suitable markers) 

Side Effects: Lights, sounds, weak spots or “back doors” in the barrier 

Reagents: Silver dust, sacred oil, buried blessed gemstones 

Pool: Intellect 

Other Assets: Warding magic, religious knowledge 

ENCHANT WEAPON 

Enchants a light, medium, or heavy weapon with magical power, granting
an asset on attack rolls with the weapon for the next day. 

Level: 3 or 4 

Time: Thirty minutes of preparation, one hour of performance 

Roles: — 

Side Effects: Weapon attack hindered, higher GM intrusion rate

Reagents: Rare oils, gem dust 

Pool: Speed or Intellect 

Other Assets: Battle tactics, weapon crafting

In a high-magic campaign, a higher-level version of the Enchant Weapon
ritual might grant a second asset on attack rolls, grant extra damage,
affect multiple weapons at once, or all of the above.

ENTOMBMENT 

Imprisons a creature in a vessel (usually a valuable box, clay pot, or
other closeable container, but it might be a gem, the heart of a tree,
or another atypical object) for as long as the vessel remains closed and
undamaged. The ritual forces the creature into the vessel, either in a
spiritual form or by shrinking it to a size that will fit within the
vessel. 

Level: The level of the creature 

Time: Sixteen hours of preparation, one hour of performance 

Roles: Chanting, carrying or protecting the vessel 

Side Effects: Bystander imprisoned with the target, containment has a
flaw, target lashes out 

Reagents: Vessel, symbolic bindings (chains, ropes, shackles, and so
on), anathema objects 

Pool: Intellect 

Other Assets: Control magic, grappling, imprisoning magic, wards

EXORCISM 

Drives out unwanted spirits (ghosts, demons, or something else) from an
area up to a long distance across. Once cast out, the spirits cannot
return for a year and a day (although most of them decide to move on
long before that time comes). Completing the ritual doesn’t prevent
other spirits from entering or inhabiting the area, but it is likely
that they can sense that an exorcism happened there, and most choose to
avoid such an area so they don’t suffer the same fate. The ritual can
also be used to cast out spirits from a possessed creature, preventing
those spirits from returning for a year and a day. As with using the
ritual to cleanse a location, this doesn’t prevent other spirits from
afflicting the creature, but later spirits can sense the recent exorcism
and prefer to avoid that creature.

Level: The level of the most powerful hostile presence to be exorcised 

Time: Two hours of preparation, two hours of performance 

Roles: Chanting, positive emotions, presenting holy objects, restraining
afflicted individuals, tracing the area with incense 

Side Effects: Lights, sounds, hideous physical transformations,
injuries, telekinesis 

Reagents: Bindings, candles, holy water, religious icons and books,
scapegoats 

Pool: Intellect 

Other Assets: Warding magic, religious knowledge 

Using an exorcism ritual on an area is mainly for getting rid of spirits
afflicting the area in ways other than possessing a creature— throwing
objects, causing nightmares, making noises, and so on.

FLESH FOR KNOWLEDGE 

Sacrifices some of the ritualist’s flesh, inflicting Might and Speed
damage equal to the level of the ritual and permanently reducing the
character’s Pools by 4 points (the character can divide this loss
between Might and Speed as they see fit). The character experiences
painful hallucinations that give them insight and understanding. They
immediately learn one type or focus ability available to them (any
ability they could learn by spending 4 XP as an advancement). 

Level: Twice the tier of the ability the character wishes to learn 

Time: One hour of preparation, one hour of performance 

Roles: Chanting, restraining the subject of the ritual 

Side Effects: Lasting damage, permanent damage, scarring 

Reagents: Silver knife, silver vessel 

Pool: See above 

Other Assets: Pain tolerance, surgery 

Instead of permanently reducing a character’s Pools by 4 points, the GM
could allow other permanent penalties such as reducing an Edge stat by 1
(to a minimum of 0), gaining an inability in a useful skill, or
permanently reducing all points gained through recovery rolls by 2.

PURIFICATION 

Rids a creature of an ongoing affliction, such as a disease or poison,
or any unwanted magical effect, such as a curse or charm spell. In some
versions of this ritual, whatever is ailing the creature gets forced
into a nearby specified creature or object, which is then discarded or
safely destroyed.

Level: The level of the affliction or effect to remove 

Time: One hour of preparation, two hours of performance 

Roles: Applying reagents, chanting 

Side Effects: Affliction or effect spreads to another creature, target
moves a step down the damage track 

Reagents: Anointing oils, healing herbs, objects repellent to the source
of the affliction, magical paint for writing on the target, scapegoat,
silver dust 

Pool: Might 

Other Assets: Healing magic, resistance to the target’s affliction

RESURRECTION 

Restores a dead being to life. The creature is restored to full health
and is ready to act as soon as the ritual is completed. Depending on how
they died and the nature of death in the setting, the creature may or
may not remember anything that happened after they died. 

Level: The level of the deceased (at least tier 6 if a PC) 

Time: Five hours of preparation, two hours of performance 

Roles: Applying reagents, chanting, prayers, shielding the corpse from
hostile entities 

Side Effects: Creature moves a step down the damage track, enmity of a
death god, lasting damage, scarring, sympathetic damage 

Reagents: Deceased’s corpse, healing ointment, items of emotional
significance (such as devotion, hope, or regret), items of importance to
the deceased, parchment extolling the deceased’s history and deeds,
soul-sympathetic items 

Pool: Might or Intellect 

Other Assets: Close relationship with the deceased (such as a connection
or family relation), healing magic, necromancy, spirit knowledge, secret
name of the deceased

A lesser version of the Resurrection ritual might bring the creature
back to life, but only to the debilitated or impaired state on the
damage track instead of hale, requiring further rest or healing. 

SACRIFICIAL RITE 

A creature is ritually killed and its soul is placed in an object. The
soul object might be a temporary destination so the soul can be
transported and used elsewhere (such as an offering to a demon or as
part of a spell), or it might be the final destination for the soul
(such as placing it in a sword to create a magic item). 

Level: The level of the creature (at least tier 6 if a PC) 

Time: One hour of preparation, one hour of performance Roles: Chanting,
playing instruments, bearing the soul object, restraining the creature,
slaying the creature 

Side Effects: Creature rages or escapes, damage, dying curse, haunting 

Reagents: Bindings, creature to be sacrificed, drum, flute, silver
knife, soul object (its level must be at least as high as the creature’s
level) 

Pool: Might or Intellect 

Other Assets: Death spells, instant-kill abilities, soul manipulation

MAGICAL TECHNOLOGY

To craft items of magical technology in a setting where they are
commonplace, use the standard rules for crafting regular (nonmagical)
items.

MAGIC PLUS TECHNOLOGY

Whatever technology exists in the setting could be magically enhanced if
magic is also present. Such items would almost certainly be manifest
cyphers or artifacts. Here’s an example cypher:

FROZEN TIMEPIECE

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Creates or transforms into a pocket watch that seems to be made
of ice. Upon activation of the cypher, the user can take normal actions,
but everything and everyone around them is frozen in time. The user
cannot affect anything else, but they can move through the world and
take actions that affect themselves or their own belongings (bandage a
wound, repair a broken item, and so on). The effect lasts for one round
per cypher level.

And here’s an example artifact:

TRUTH BINOCULARS

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Pair of binoculars with a large runic symbol on them

Effect: Not only do these make it easy to see things far away, but
looking through them also allows the viewer to see through illusions and
see things that are normally invisible, assuming the effect has a level
lower than that of the binoculars.

Depletion: 1–2 in 1d100 (check each use)

To craft items that are both technological and magical, either you need
to make the device first and then enchant it, or you need to enchant it
as it is made. Either way, the skills for making the device and for
making it magical are likely very different.

TECHNOLOGY THAT INTERACTS WITH MAGIC

In a world with scientists and engineers faced with the presence of real
magic, some of them would develop ways to interact and cope with it.
Technological devices that are not magical but deal with magic could
include:

Magic detector (expensive): This simple white badge glows purple in the
presence of magic. Once it detects something magical, it does not
function again. 

Mystical hazard suit (very expensive): This full-body protective suit is
cumbersome and clumsy, not unlike a hazmat suit. However, all of the
wearer’s tasks to resist magical effects are eased. If the wearer takes
even 1 point of physical damage, the suit rips and no longer functions
until it is repaired and resealed. 

Spellscrambler (very expensive): Essentially a sonic grenade, this
device produces a variety of strange electromagnetic signals—some
audible and very loud, some not—on a number of frequencies. The mental
processes needed to cast a spell are impossible to achieve for one round
within a short distance of the device. Like any grenade, it can be used
only once.

MAGIC THAT INTERACTS WITH TECHNOLOGY

In a world where magic and technology coexist, wizards will have spells
and effects that protect them from shotgun blasts as well as sword
blades, and radiation as well as fire or frost. Consider, for example,
these effects as cyphers:

FINDING PRYING EYES 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Effect: Magically discovers if anything is watching or listening to the
user right at that moment, and reveals the source. Electronic
surveillance devices, long-range scopes, hidden cameras, and magical
scrying attempts all trigger this effect. In all these cases, the
“source” is the nearest representation. So a hidden microphone is
revealed, but not the location of the listener. 

POWER DEVICE 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Effect: Magically powers one device that can fit within an area a short
distance across. The device is now fully powered, charged, or fueled. If
the cypher is used on an automobile, for example, the gas tank is full.
If used on a flashlight, the battery is fully charged. 

SCREEN CONTROL 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Effect: A technological screen (a television, computer monitor,
smartphone, or the like) within short range shows whatever the user
wishes for up to one minute per cypher level. The display can be
pictures, text, or meaningless shapes and colors.

Because magic works on intuitive rather than scientific levels, mages
could have spells that disrupt technology, even though the technology
involved might not have any common principles

MIND CONTROL

From a rules perspective, mind control is fairly straightforward: one
creature decides what actions another creature takes (perhaps limited in
that the controlled creature won’t take actions that harm them or go
against their nature, such as attacking friends). But what’s happening
inside the controlled creature’s head—whether during the effect or
afterward—often isn’t specified. There are several options for the GM to
consider, either for all kinds of mind-control magic or on a
case-by-case basis. 

Confusion: The controlled creature doesn’t understand why they’re doing
things they normally wouldn’t do, but they aren’t aware of any outside
influence on their thoughts and actions. Once the control is over, the
creature may admit that they don’t know why they did those things, or
come up with an explanation justifying (to themselves and others) their
reasons for those actions. 

Dream: The controlled creature is aware of what’s going on but perceives
it in a dreamlike state. They may believe that they’re in control of
themselves the entire time, or somewhat aware that they’re not fully in
control (similar to being intoxicated by drugs or alcohol or disoriented
by an illness). Afterward, the creature might feel strange about the
events but may not realize that someone else was controlling them. 

Trapped: The active thoughts in the controlled creature’s head come from
the controller, but the creature still has a small voice or awareness in
the background, like they’re a prisoner in their own mind. This horrible
situation usually means the controlled creature reverts to normal once
the control is gone, and is probably very upset that their mind and body
autonomy were violated.

One way to present mind control more safely is to disallow certain
actions but otherwise leave the character in control. For example, being
charmed by a vampire might mean the PC can’t attack the vampire (or its
allies) or run away, but is still able to call for help, heal
themselves, leave at a normal pace, and take other actions.
Alternatively, the character can be given a specific command, and until
they comply with that command their other actions are hindered by one or
more steps. If the player is willing to engage with the parameters of
the mind control, the GM may award them an additional 1 XP (or, to
approach it from the opposite direction, the GM can offer them a GM
intrusion that the mind control is happening, and allow the player to
spend 1 XP to refuse it, or go into XP debt if they want to refuse it
but have no XP to spend).

A rule for any game: don’t use mind control (or anything) to make a
character have sex without the player’s permission. For more information
and guidelines about consent in RPGs, read the free Consent in Gaming
PDF at myMCG.info/consent

MYSTICAL MARTIAL ARTS

If the setting calls for wuxia-style fantasy martial arts or similar
types of action, you can make a few rule changes to portray the kinds of
things characters in such stories can accomplish.

Running and climbing speeds and jumping distances are doubled. For those
trained in running, climbing, or jumping, the speeds and distances are
tripled instead of doubled. For those specialized, they are quintupled.
For all intents and purposes, this means that everyone can run up a wall
or jump very high in the air, and masters can practically fly or run
across water.

Everyone knows kung fu. Unless a person is a simple farmer, herder, or
merchant, they know how to fight with elaborate and powerful martial
arts styles. This doesn’t change anything in the game mechanically—no
one gets the ability to use weapons that they wouldn’t normally have
under the rules. But it does change the flavor, suggesting that no PC is
entirely ignorant of weapons or close combat. 

Players are encouraged to come up with interesting names for their
martial arts abilities. Instead of using a Bash attack, perhaps it is
“The Three-Flower Fist,” and instead of Fury, a character uses “The Rage
of the Sevenfold.” It is reasonable for high-tier martial abilities such
as Amazing Effort, Jump Attack, or Finishing Blow to be described with a
magical flare— blazing auras of fire, brilliant cascades of light,
ethereal figures overlaying the character, and so on. 

Materials and objects are easier to destroy. For the purpose of
attacking objects, subtract 2 from the level of any material (minimum of
0). It should be relatively simple for any character to smash through a
plain wooden door with little effort, and true warriors can shatter
stones with their blows. 

Wounds heal faster. Everyone gains +1 to all recovery rolls. 

Superhuman abilities exist. Consider adopting some of the superhero
rules from the Cypher System Reference Document, in particular the power
shift optional rules. These may derive from almost supernatural levels
of training in various techniques (such as dianxue) but probably mostly
from neili.

Dianxue: The touch of death—killing by using precise nonlethal force on
key points of the body. Neili: Internal force— building up and
cultivating the energy known as qi and using it for supernatural
effects.

POSSESSION

Some creatures (demons, ghosts, entities of living mental energy, and so
on) have the ability to possess a living person, taking over a
character’s body as if it were the creature’s own. The creature must
touch the character to attempt possession (even if the creature’s touch
normally inflicts damage, the possession attempt doesn’t inflict
damage). The character must make an Intellect defense roll or become
possessed, whereupon the creature’s immaterial form disappears into the
character.

The first round in which a character is possessed, they can act
normally. In the second and all subsequent rounds, the possessing
creature can try to control the actions of the host, but the character
can attempt an Intellect defense roll to resist each suggested action.
Successful resistance means that the character does nothing for one
round. When the creature isn’t trying to control the host, the character
can act as they choose. Usually, a possessing creature’s actions are
limited to controlling its host and leaving the host (the creature’s own
abilities are unavailable to it while in someone else’s body).

While it possesses a character, the creature is immune to most direct
attacks (though not so the host; killing the host will eject the
creature). For example, hitting a demon-possessed human with a sword
hurts only the human, not the demon controlling them. Mental attacks and
special abilities that only affect possession or the type of possessing
creature usually work normally

A possessed character is allowed an Intellect defense roll to eject the
creature once per day. The defense roll is hindered by one additional
step each day of possession after the first seven days. An ejected,
cast-out, or exorcised demon is powerless for one or more days. One way
to exorcise a demon is to command it out in the name of an entity that
has power over the demon. This can be attempted once per day and grants
the possessed character an additional Intellect defense roll to eject
the demon.

Possession is like mind control in that it takes away a player’s ability
to control their character, and that can make some players very
uncomfortable. See the section on mind control and consent for more
information (page 67).

SECRET AND TRUE NAMES

Learning a creature’s true name comes with a subtle and instinctive
awareness and understanding of that creature, including its strengths
and weaknesses. In general, this eases all tasks related to that
creature (including attacks, defenses, and interactions) by two steps.
In some cases, confronting a creature with knowledge of its true name
might be enough to convince it to perform a service without
compensation. A creature doesn’t automatically know if someone has
learned its true name (although there is magic that can reveal this
knowledge), but they can usually figure out that an informed opponent
has some kind of advantage against them and deduce that their secret
name is involved. 

Learning a true name is difficult and takes time. A character wanting to
discover a creature’s true name might choose the Uncover a Secret
character arc to do so.

WISHES

Unless the GM’s intention is to make the players regret that their
characters were offered a wish, it’s best to give them what they ask
for, as much as it is within the power of the creature to do so. If the
GM wants to twist the wish, do so as a GM intrusion— that way, the
character still gets a reward, and they can either accept the twisted
wish (which isn’t as good as they had hoped) or pay 1 XP to reject the
intrusion (which represents them coming up with airtight wording that
can’t be twisted).

Second, consider the level of the creature granting the wish—that’s
basically the level of the wish, as the creature shouldn’t be able to
grant a boon more powerful than itself. Therefore, it’s reasonable that
a level 6 creature could create a level 6 effect. The GM could look at
the creature’s other abilities (or abilities of other creatures of its
level), decide if what the PC is asking for is within its power, and
either grant the requested wish or adjust the result downward until it’s
appropriate for the creature’s power. 

Wishing for more wishes doesn’t work because a creature shouldn’t be
able to create something more powerful than itself—at least not without
some investment of time and other resources, like a character using XP
to acquire an artifact.

FANTASY RULES MODULE 

AWARDING TREASURE

It’s best to think of gold and magic as two different kinds of
currencies that characters have access to. 

GOLD

The Cypher System abstracts item costs into general categories—
inexpensive, moderate, expensive, and so on. Starting characters
generally have access to only a few inexpensive and moderate items and
perhaps one or two expensive items. In a typical fantasy campaign, the
characters should become wealthier as they advance. 

MANIFEST CYPHERS

The expectation is that PCs will use cyphers often because they’ll have
many opportunities to get more; if the players can exploit this mechanic
by selling off most of their cyphers in town, they’re abusing the rules
to make gold. The GM might be tempted to discourage this behavior by
reducing how often the PCs gain new cyphers, but that goes against the
premise of cyphers in the game: they should be common enough that the
PCs use them freely instead of hoarding them. The key to addressing this
selling-cyphers wealth problem is to make it harder to sell or trade
cyphers for gold.

The PCs can have opportunities to trade their cyphers with NPCs in town,
whether that’s at a magic item shop, the tower of a mentor wizard, a
thieves’ guild, a temple, other adventurers, or the local government.
The kinds of cyphers these NPCs can offer may be limited in theme (such
as a benevolent church that makes healing potions and trades them for
other useful cyphers) or quantity (such as having only one or two
cyphers available each month). Two cyphers of the same level are
generally considered to be about the same value, although local biases
and NPC interests may affect their willingness to trade certain items
despite or because of a level disparity

ARTIFACTS

Artifacts are the high end of magical currency, and in terms of buying
and selling them, they’re like manifest cyphers: not something a typical
NPC can use, and beyond what a typical NPC can afford, but they could be
traded for a different artifact of about the same level. Unlike cyphers,
the game doesn’t assume that PCs have frequent opportunities to gain new
artifacts or replace the ones that deplete. 

In a pinch, an artifact is worth the equivalent of one or two very
expensive items or one exorbitant item, depending on what the artifact
can do. An artifact that grants an asset to one kind of roll is probably
worth about as much as a very expensive item, one that adds +1 Armor
might be worth two expensive items, and a strong defensive or offensive
artifact could be worth about the same as an exorbitant item.

DUNGEONS, CASTLES, AND KEEPS

This section describes several kinds of common physical features and
their game stats. Any of these levels can be adjusted up or down by the
GM—a wall made from soft wood can have a lower level than a typical
wall, stone can be reinforced by magic so its level is higher, and so
on.

WALLS

Walls are generally either constructed (intentionally built by a
creature) or natural (already existing without any work by a creature).
Anything describing walls in this section also applies to ceilings and
floors. 

Paper wall (level 1): This thin wall only blocks sight. Creatures can
attack through a paper wall as if attacking blindly (hindered by four
steps), but it’s usually easier to break a hole in the wall and attack
through the hole. Paper walls are vulnerable to piercing and slashing
weapons (attacks are eased). A gauzy curtain is equivalent to a paper
wall, and a cloth wall is probably level 2. 

Wooden wall (level 4): This is a typical wall for an average wooden
house. The walls of a decrepit shack or a partition within a dungeon
might be only level 2 or 3, but the exterior palisade wall of a fort or
a log cabin might be level 5. Wooden walls are vulnerable to fire
(attacks with fire are eased) but resistant to bashing and piercing
weapons (attacks are hindered). 

Stone wall (level 6): Constructed stone walls are bricks or masonry
(fitted stones), with or without mortar to hold them in place, or hewn
stone (dug into existing natural rock). Natural stone walls are usually
unworked stone (like a cave wall or cliff face, which tend to be uneven)
but might have areas where creatures smoothed or modified them to suit
their needs for a living space. Some constructed stone walls are
reinforced with metal bars on the surface or built inside, increasing
its level to 7. Stone walls are vulnerable to piercing weapons (attacks
are eased) but resistant to bashing and slashing weapons (attacks are
hindered). 

Iron wall (level 7): These expensive walls are usually reserved for
protecting something important, like a vault.

DOORS

Doors are access points for encounters and (if trapped or infested with
dangerous creatures) can be encounters all on their own. In most cases,
trying to break through a door involves damaging its latch or hinges
rather than destroying the main portion of the door (trying to destroy
the door instead of the latch and hinges is a hindered task). 

Simple wooden door (level 2): This is a fragile door meant to close off
an interior space for privacy rather than to keep out a determined
intruder. Instead of a single piece of wood, a simple wooden door is
usually made of multiple planks nailed together on a frame or with
support struts. Wooden doors of all strengths are vulnerable to fire
(attacks with fire are eased) but resistant to bashing and piercing
weapons (attacks are hindered). 

Good wooden door (level 3): This is a stronger door meant to provide
some security, such as for a typical house or shop. 

Strong wooden door (level 4): This is a heavy door reinforced with wood
or metal to make it difficult to break. An especially strong wooden
door, such as the main entrance to a fort or castle, is probably level
5. 

Stone door (level 5): These heavy doors are usually carved from a solid
block of stone and designed to pivot on a center point. They are common
in places like dungeons where wood and metal are scarce. Stone doors are
vulnerable to piercing weapons (attacks are eased) but resistant to
bashing and slashing weapons (attacks are hindered). 

Iron door (level 6): A solid iron door is meant to protect something
very valuable or vulnerable, such as a vault or a king’s tomb. In a damp
environment like a dungeon, they tend to rust and stick in place. 

Wooden portcullis (level 3): The gaps in a portcullis present more
defense opportunities than a door, such as allowing archers to fire at
the creatures trapped by it. They’re also useful in closing access to a
waterway without impacting its flow. A wooden portcullis is relatively
fragile and usually isn’t meant to keep anyone out for long. 

Iron portcullis (level 6): Much sturdier than wood, an iron portcullis
is meant to keep creatures in place as long as necessary. Often the best
way to get past a portcullis is to lift it instead of breaking it, but
some are designed to lock in place to prevent this. A door to a prison
cell is essentially a type of iron portcullis.

TRAPS

One common element of fantasy exploration—particularly for castles and
dungeons—is the danger of traps.

TRIGGERING TRAPS

Mechanical traps have a triggering mechanism—something set up to react
when an unauthorized creature is in the area. Magical traps have
triggers that are usually based on proximity—if a creature enters the
area the trap is “watching,” it activates.

FINDING TRAPS

Most characters won’t notice traps unless actively looking for them;
they don’t know a trap is in the area until their presence, movement, or
action triggers it. Characters can passively or actively search for
traps if they suspect such dangers are present. 

Passive searching for traps means one character (usually in the front of
the group) is carefully checking the area before moving forward. This
means the group moves at about half normal speed, but they get to make a
search roll for any traps the GM has in their path. Allowing characters
to passively search in this way means the players don’t have to keep
stating over and over that they’re looking for traps. The drawback for
them is that it takes them more time to get anywhere (which means
time-based special abilities and cyphers will run out sooner).

Active searching is used when the characters worry or suspect that there
is a trap in the area and want to find it. Active searching takes about
one round for each immediate area searched. Rather than having the
players make separate rolls for each immediate area, the GM should have
them make one roll for the entire room; if successful, they find the
trap, and if they fail, they don’t find it. If there is a second trap,
the GM can have them make another roll after they’ve resolved the first
trap.

DISABLING, DAMAGING, AND BYPASSING TRAPS

A character can attempt to disable a trap so it’s no longer able to
activate or harm anyone. Normally this task has the same difficulty as
the trap’s level, but some traps are rickety and easy to disable, while
others are carefully crafted and much harder to disable. Traps are
objects and use the object damage track. Characters can attack a trap
with weapons or special abilities to damage or destroy it. Some traps
may be vulnerable to certain attacks or unusual means of sabotage (such
as hammering a piton into a groove where a blade springs out). Magical
traps can be damaged or disabled with special abilities.

Instead of disabling a trap, a character can try to bypass it so they
and their allies can get past it without triggering it but still leave
it as a danger to anyone else who passes through the area. The task to
bypass a trap is hindered by two steps

Failing an attempt to disable, bypass, or sabotage a trap means it
activates. Usually the trap’s target is the acting character, and the
trap’s attack is eased because the character placed themselves in harm’s
way

Unless a character has the ability to manipulate magic, it’s very
difficult to bypass a magical trap (the attempt is hindered by two
additional steps).

UNDERSTANDING THE LISTINGS

The rest of the chapter presents a large number of traps with game
stats. Every trap is presented by name, followed by a standard template
that includes the following categories. If an entry doesn’t apply to a
particular trap, it is omitted from the listing. 

Level: Like the difficulty of a task, each trap has a level. You use the
level to determine the target number a PC must reach to find, evade, or
disable the trap. In each entry, the difficulty number for the trap is
listed after its level (always three times the trap’s level). 

Description: This general description explains what the trap does, how
it operates, whether it resets automatically, if it has a limited number
of uses, and so on.

Damage Inflicted: Generally, when a trap hits a creature, it inflicts
its level in damage regardless of the form of attack (arrow, poison,
collapsing ceiling, and so on). The entries always specify the amount of
damage inflicted, even if it’s the normal amount for a trap of its
level. 

Modifications: Use these numbers when a trap’s information says to use a
different target number. For example, a level 4 trap might say “defends
as level 5,” which means PCs attacking it or trying to disable it must
roll a target number of 15 (for difficulty 5) instead of 12 (for
difficulty 4). Typical modifiers are to the trap’s attacks, defenses,
and stealth (how hard or easy it is to notice the trap). 

GM Intrusion: This entry suggests one or more ways to use GM intrusions
in an encounter with the trap. It’s just one possible idea of many, and
the GM is encouraged to come up with their own uses of the game
mechanic.

COMMON TRAP POISONS

Blindness: The poison blinds the creature if they fail a defense roll.
Typical durations are one minute, ten minutes, and one hour. 

Choking: The poison makes the creature choke and cough if they fail a
defense roll. Typical durations are one minute, ten minutes, and one
hour. Severe versions of choking poison might make a creature start to
suffocate. 

Damage Track: The poison moves the creature down one step on the damage
track if they fail a defense roll. 

Debilitating: The poison hinders all of the creature’s actions by one or
two steps if they fail a defense roll. (Some poisons may affect only
certain kinds of actions, such as Speed defense rolls or Might-based
tasks.) Typical durations are ten minutes, one hour, and ten hours. 

Instant Damage: The poison inflicts damage (Might, Speed, or Intellect)
one time if the creature fails a defense roll. 

Ongoing Damage: The poison inflicts damage (Might, Speed, or Intellect)
immediately. When a certain amount of time has passed (such as every
round or every minute), it inflicts damage again if the creature fails
its defense roll. The ongoing damage usually ends on its own (such as
after five additional rounds of damage) or after the creature makes a
defense roll against it. Usually the ongoing damage is a much smaller
amount than the initial damage, such as 1 point every round. 

Paralysis: The poison prevents the creature from taking any physical
actions if they fail a defense roll (this might leave them standing in
place like a statue, or make them go limp and collapse to the floor).
Typical durations are ten minutes, one hour, and ten hours. 

Sleep: The poison knocks the creature unconscious if they fail a defense
roll. Typical durations are ten minutes, one hour, and ten hours. The
poison might also make the creature groggy, hindering all actions for an
additional amount of time equal to how long the unconsciousness would
have lasted (for example, knocking out a creature for an hour and then
making them groggy for an hour, even if they’re awakened early).

ARROW 4 (12)

Fires an arrow or crossbow bolt. The simplest one-use trap of this kind
is an actual crossbow (perhaps hidden behind a hole in a wall or door)
rigged with a tripwire to pull the trigger; a creature would need to
manually reset this trap for it to be a danger again. More complex traps
might automatically reload from a supply of bolts so the trap can be
triggered multiple times, or fire automatically once triggered until the
ammunition is expended. A variant of this trap releases a volley of
arrows into the targeted area, affecting multiple creatures or the same
creature more than once. 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Modifications: Defense and stealth as level 6 (if hidden behind a hole
in the wall) 

GM Intrusion: The arrow is barbed, and removing it inflicts 3 points of
damage. The arrow is attached to a string, cord, or wire, with the other
end tied to something dangerous like a falling block or an electrical
shock.

CRUSHING WALL 6 (18)

A section of a wall falls over onto the targeted character. This is
usually a one-use trap (although a similar trap could be built in its
place). 

A variant of this trap is a deadfall, where something heavy (such as a
log, huge stone block, or cart full of rocks) falls from a higher
position onto the character. Sometimes the falling block is made to
exactly fit a trapped corridor so that triggering the trap makes the
area impassible.

 A less lethal variant drops a large amount of sand or dirt, inflicting
3 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor). Another variant releases oil
(perhaps burning) or marbles, inflicting 3 points of ambient damage and
making the area difficult terrain.

Damage Inflicted: 6 points (ignores Armor) 

GM Intrusion: The fallen wall blocks access to an exit. The wall debris
buries the character, who is trapped until they can dig free. Another
trap, hazard, or threat is behind the fallen wall (such as arrow traps
or a room full of zombies) and can now reach the characters.

DISINTEGRATION 7 (21)

A magical ray of eerie energy blasts the character, disrupting their
physical matter. Any creature killed by the ray (or any object destroyed
by it) turns to dust. 

Damage Inflicted: 15 points 

GM Intrusion: In addition to inflicting damage, the ray moves the
character one step down the damage track. Part of the ray splits or
ricochets off the character and strikes a second creature, inflicting 10
points of damage. 

EXPLOSIVE GLYPH 4 (12)

A magical rune activates when touched or passed over, exploding in an
immediate or short area. Typical glyphs inflict acid, cold, electricity,
or fire damage, but more unusual versions include ones that inflict
holy, shadow, thorn, unholy, or stranger types of magical energy damage.
A nonmagical variant of this trap sprays a mist of acid, a jet of
electrified salt water, or a gout of burning oil. 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points of energy damage (ignores Armor); all
creatures in the area take 1 point of damage even if they make their
defense roll. 

Modifications: Stealth as level 5 

GM Intrusion: The glyph marks the character’s face with a symbol
indicating they are a thief. The glyph makes the character run away in
fear for one minute. The character is cursed, and all of their actions
are hindered until the curse is removed.

FLOODING ROOM 4 (12)

Exits to the room close off and the area starts to fill with water.
Within a few minutes, the entire room is flooded and creatures in it
begin to drown. 

A variant of this room reduces the air pressure (either by pumping it
out through tiny holes or by retracting the floor or ceiling). As the
air gets thinner, characters are hindered by one, two, or three steps
before falling unconscious and starting to suffocate. (Restoring the air
allows the characters to awaken, but doesn’t move them back up the
damage track.) 

Damage Inflicted: None until drowning starts 

Modifications: Defends as level 7 

GM Intrusion: Hostile creatures such as piranhas or electric eels are in
the water and attack all creatures. The room fills with water faster
than expected because the floor and/or ceiling are also moving toward
each other.

MANGLER 3 (9)

A small hole in the wall extends sharp blades or weights when a creature
reaches into it, mangling their hand and hindering all actions requiring
that hand by one or two steps. 

A floor variant is a small trapdoor over a closed compartment, which
mangles the character’s foot when they step on the trapdoor, reducing
their movement speed by half.

 Another variant is a needle trap attached to a small peephole or
spyhole in a door or wall. The trap springs when the character touches
the area around the hole (even a slight touch with their face as they
look is sufficient), inflicting lasting damage to the character’s eye
and partially blinding them. A gentler variant traps the character’s
limb in glue instead of inflicting damage. The character’s extremity
might be glued to the hole, or they may be able to pull free but have a
glue pot stuck on their hand or foot. 

Damage Inflicted: 3 points, plus lasting damage 

Modifications: Stealth as level 4 

GM Intrusion: The trap has hooks, holding the character in place and
inflicting damage when they try to escape if they fail a Speed defense
roll. The glue attracts a swarm of fire ants or wasps. The glue is also
a slow-acting acid or poison.

NET 3 (9)

A net suspended above the character drops and constricts (and perhaps
lifts the character off the ground). Large net traps can affect multiple
creatures at once. This kind of trap usually requires a creature to
manually reset it.

A variant of this trap is a snare made of sturdy cord or wire. 

Damage Inflicted: Entanglement (trapped character cannot move until they
use an action to make a Might or Speed defense roll to break or escape
the net) 

Modifications: Attacks as level 5, defends as level 2 

GM Intrusion: The net is barbed, inflicting 1 point of damage each round
that the trapped character tries to move. The net is the nesting place
for biting insects, which swarm and attack the trapped character and all
nearby creatures each round.

PIT 4 (12)

A trapdoor in the floor opens, dropping the triggering character into a
pit. Larger versions of this trap can catch multiple characters at once.
The trap can be reset by moving the trapdoor back into its closed
position. In outdoor areas, this trap is more likely to be a pit covered
in leafy branches (or a tarp) and camouflaged by soil and other debris. 

A variant of this trap is a bridge over a chasm, river, or other
dangerous location that is rigged to collapse when enough weight reaches
the middle section. 

Damage Inflicted: 1 point of ambient damage per 10 feet fallen (ignores
Armor) 

GM Intrusion: The trapdoor is slippery with oil, hindering attempts to
catch the edge and avoid falling. The trapdoor closes after the
character falls through, trapping them inside in the darkness. The walls
of the pit are greased, hindering attempts to climb out by two steps. A
dangerous creature is at the bottom of the pit (or in a room adjacent to
it). The pit is filled with poison gas. The trapdoor detaches and falls
into the pit, inflicting 1 point of ambient damage per 10 feet it falls.
The pit has spikes at the bottom, inflicting an additional 4 points of
damage to anyone who falls in.

POISON GAS 3 (9)

The area slowly fills with poison gas. Because it takes a minute or more
for the poison to become thick enough to cause harm, it is likely that
the character won’t realize at first that they’ve sprung a trap. 

A variant of this trap fills the room with flammable gas, which explodes
if there is an open flame (such as from a torch) or a spark (such as a
metal weapon against metal armor), inflicting fire damage equal to the
trap’s level. 

A further variant fills the room with dead air (containing no oxygen),
which slowly extinguishes flames and suffocates creatures. 

Damage Inflicted: As poison 

Modifications: Stealth as level 5 

GM Intrusion: The character has an allergic reaction to the gas, which
hinders all their actions for an hour after exposure because of
sneezing, watery eyes, or itchy skin. The gas makes the character
hallucinate, mistaking their companions for enemies, until they make an
Intellect defense roll. The gas is flammable.

POISON NEEDLE 5 (15)

A poisoned needle jabs at a character touching the trapped object
(usually a lock or treasure chest) or is fired from a mechanism similar
to an arrow trap. It may have a reservoir of poison that allows it to
attack several times. 

Damage Inflicted: 1 point (plus poison)

Modifications: Stealth as level 6 

GM Intrusion: The trap releases acid into the lock mechanism, making the
trapped object impossible to unlock. The trap releases acid into the
container, destroying some of the valuables inside. The trap releases a
puff of poison gas instead of a poisoned needle, affecting all nearby
characters.

PORTCULLIS 5 (15)

An iron portcullis drops from the ceiling to block access to an area or
separate a character from others nearby. If the creature dodging the
falling portcullis wants to choose which side of the trap they end up
on, the Speed defense roll is hindered. Otherwise, it is even chances
what side they end up on. 

A variant of this trap is a solid wall. A magical variant is a force
field. 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

GM Intrusion: The portcullis impales the character, trapping them
beneath it until it is lifted or destroyed. The portcullis is
electrified, inflicting 1 point of damage each time it is touched or
attacked with flesh or a metal object. A second portcullis drops nearby,
trapping a character in a small area. Murder-holes in the ceiling allow
enemies to make ranged attacks on the trapped character.

ROLLING BOULDER 6 (12)

A large boulder, wheel, or barrel rolls into the area, crushing anything
in its path. Depending on the configuration of the area, the boulder
might follow a specific path, ricochet erratically, break open pit
traps, or get stuck somewhere. 

A variant is a large iron weight on a chain that swings from the
ceiling. The weight swings back and forth several times, giving it
multiple chances to hit the characters, but decreasing its damage with
each swing until it stops and becomes an obstacle. 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Modifications: Defends as level 7 

GM Intrusion: The boulder crashes through a door or wall, giving other
dangerous creatures access to the character’s location. The boulder
blocks the way out. The boulder carries a character along with it for
some distance. The boulder is hollow and full of burning oil, leaving a
fiery trail behind it. The boulder is hollow and contains undead
skeletons, which jump out as it moves and attack nearby creatures.

SLICING BLADE 5 (15)

A thin blade slices out from a gap in the wall, floor, or ceiling. The
trap might be designed to sweep the entire area (such as the width of a
corridor) or leave a tiny safe space just beyond the blade’s reach so a
creature who knows of the trap can get past it. This kind of trap is
usually designed to reset automatically after a minute or has a lever
nearby that allows a creature to reset it manually. 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Modifications: Attacks as level 6 

GM Intrusion: The blade is a magical weapon with an additional effect,
such as inflicting 3 points of fire damage. The blade is rusted and
breaks off when it hits the character, inflicting 1 point of damage
(ignores Armor) each round after the initial attack until it is healed.

SLIDING STAIR 4 (12)

A stairway or section of stairs unexpectedly turns into a ramp. Anyone
who makes a Speed defense roll can catch hold near where they were
standing; otherwise, they slide or tumble to the bottom and take damage.
This kind of trap usually resets after a minute or has a manual reset
lever at the top or bottom of the stairs. 

Damage Inflicted: 1 point of ambient damage per 20 feet slid (ignores
Armor) 

GM Intrusion: The trap releases oil, hindering attempts to climb the
ramp or stairs by two steps. Tiny blades stick out between the sections
of the ramp, inflicting an additional 3 points of damage. The trap
releases a boulder to roll down the stairs after the sliding character,
inflicting an additional 3 points of damage.

SNAKE PIT 4 (12)

The trap drops the character into a pit full of snakes or drops a large
number of snakes on the character. The snakes immediately attack the
character and perhaps others in the area. 

Damage Inflicted: As per the swarm of snakes 

GM Intrusion: The snake poison is especially potent, moving the
character one step down the damage track if they fail a Might defense
roll. The snakes constrict the character, hindering their actions until
the snakes are defeated.

SPEAR 4 (12)

The trap fires a spear, javelin, or other large projectile. (In many
ways, this is a scaled-up and more dangerous version of an arrow trap,
and the same suggestions for that trap apply to this one.) 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Modifications: Defense and stealth as level 5 (if hidden behind a hole
in a wall) 

GM Intrusion: The impact of the spear knocks the character prone. The
spear is barbed, and removing it inflicts 3 points of damage. The spear
is attached to a string, cord, or wire, with the other end tied to
something dangerous like a falling block or an electrical shock

TELEPORTER 6 (18)

The trap magically moves the character to another location within about
1,000 feet (300 m), typically a prison cell, an oubliette, or a very
deep pit. It’s more efficient to kill an intruder than to teleport them,
so teleportation is usually reserved for trapping creatures for
interrogation. 

Damage Inflicted: None 

GM Intrusion: The teleport destination is above the ground, causing the
character to fall some distance and take damage (1 point of ambient
damage per 10 feet fallen). The destination is dangerous, such as a tiny
room lined with spikes, a shark tank, or a boulder in a lava lake.

FOLLOWERS

Player characters have the option to gain followers as they advance in
tier, as provided by type or focus special abilities. Followers do not
need to be paid, fed, or housed, though a character who gains followers
can certainly make such arrangements if they wish. A follower is someone
whom a character has inspired (or asked) to come work with the character
for a time, aiding them in a variety of endeavors. A follower puts the
PC’s interests ahead of, or at least on par with, their own.

The PC generally makes rolls for their follower when the follower takes
actions, though usually a follower’s modifications provide an asset to a
specific action taken by the PC they follow.

(If a follower dies, the character gains a new one after at least two
weeks and proper recruitment.)

Modifications: A follower can help a PC in one or more tasks, granting
the PC an asset to that task. The level of the follower indicates the
number of different tasks they can help with. The tasks that the
follower is able to help with are predetermined, usually chosen by the
PC when they gain the follower. A level 2 follower who the player
determines is a spy could grant a PC an asset on two different tasks,
such as stealth and deception. Followers cannot help with tasks that
they don’t have modifications for; for the purpose of helping, treat the
follower as if they had inabilities in all nonmodified tasks.

When the follower acts autonomously rather than helping the PC, they act
like a normal NPC that has modifications. Thus, the modification
increases their effective level for the associated task by one step. For
example, the level 2 spy follower with modifications for stealth and
deception attempts stealth and deception tasks as if they were level 3
and all other tasks as level 2.

Follower Assets to Combat and Defense: A follower cannot grant an asset
to a character’s attacks or defense until the follower is level 3 or
higher. Even then, the follower can help with attacks and defense only
if they have a modification for that kind of task.

Some abilities may grant a special exception to this rule. For instance,
the Serv-0 Defender ability gives your level 1 Serv-0 follower (a
machine companion) a modification for Speed defense.

Follower Level Progression: A follower increases in level by 1 each time
a PC advances two tiers after gaining that follower. When the follower
gains a level, the PC also chooses the task that the follower gains a
modification for.

Exceptional Follower: When a character gains a follower, there’s a small
chance that the follower will be exceptional in some way, a cut above
other followers of their kind. The GM determines when an exceptional
follower is found, possibly as an additional reward for smart or
engaging roleplaying where the PCs impress or otherwise positively
interact with one or more NPCs, some of whom may later go on to become
one of their followers. An exceptional follower has the same qualities
as a regular follower but is 1 level higher.

Pet: Any PC can potentially gain a pet, though a pet typically doesn’t
provide modifications. If a character wants a pet that can do this, they
must gain the pet through an an ability or focus that grants followers.
On the other hand, a well-cared-for pet grants an asset to a PC’s tasks
related to achieving peace of mind, finding comfort, and resisting
loneliness.

BREATHING LIFE INTO FOLLOWERS

The modifications provided by followers could come across as fairly dry
and mechanical. To avoid that, you could present each follower in a way
that makes them more compelling and interesting. Here are a few examples
of how to describe a follower, depending on their mix of modifications.

A firebrand diplomat able to convince an enemy horde to back down.

A veteran commander whose presence bolsters the entire community’s
military might.

A genius medic who invigorates everyone with their healing techniques.

An imaginative architect whose works both beautify and defend the city.

A tricky spy whose intelligence on enemy movements is invaluable.

Experience Points

Experience points (XP) are the currency by which players gain benefits
for their characters. The most common ways to earn XP are through GM
intrusions and by accomplishing things the PCs set out to do. Sometimes
experience points are earned during a game session, and sometimes
they’re earned between sessions. In a typical session, a player might
earn 2 to 4 XP, and between sessions, perhaps another 2 XP (on average).
The exact amounts depend on the events of the session.

GM INTRUSION

At any time, the GM can introduce an unexpected complication for a
character. When they intrude in this way, they must give that character
2 XP. That player, in turn, must immediately give one of those XP to
another player and justify the gift (perhaps the other player had a good
idea, told a joke, or performed an action that saved a life).

Often, the GM intrudes when a player attempts an action that should be
an automatic success. However, the GM is free to intrude at other times.
As a general rule, the GM should intrude at least once each session, but
no more than once or twice each session per character.

Anytime the GM intrudes, the player can spend 1 XP to refuse the
intrusion, though that also means they don’t get the 2 XP. If the player
has no XP to spend, they can’t refuse.

If a player rolls a 1 on a die, the GM can intrude without giving the
player any XP.

Example 1: Through skill and the aid of another character, a fourth-tier
PC eases a wall-climbing task from difficulty 2 to difficulty 0.
Normally, they would succeed at the task automatically, but the GM
intrudes and says “No, a bit of the crumbling wall gives way, so you
still have to make a roll.” As with any difficulty 2 task, the target
number is 6. The PC attempts the roll as normal and gains 2 XP because
the GM intruded. They immediately give one of those XP to another
player.

Example 2: During a fight, a PC swings their axe and damages a foe with
a slice across the shoulder. The GM intrudes by saying that the foe
turned just as the axe struck, wrenching the weapon from the character’s
grip and sending it clattering across the floor. The axe comes to a stop
10 feet (3 m) away. Because the GM intruded, the PC gains 2 XP, and the
player immediately gives one of those XP to another player. Now the
character must deal with the dropped weapon, perhaps drawing a different
weapon or using their next turn to scramble after the axe.

(For much more on GM intrusions, see the Running the Cypher System
chapter.)

CHARACTER ARCS

Character arcs are the means by which players can invest themselves more
in great stories and character depth and development.

Just like in a book or a television show, characters progress through
their own personal story and change over time. A PC with a character arc
decides for themselves what they do and why. Character arcs are like
stated goals for a character, and by progressing toward that goal, the
character advances. The key word there is *progressing*. A PC doesn’t
have to succeed at achieving the goal to earn advancement—it’s not an
all-or-nothing prospect. Each arc is keyed to a single character, but
just like in a book or show, characters can take part in the larger
story arc that the whole group participates in, while also progressing
in their own personal arc.

Character arcs have different steps that mark the character’s progress
through the arc. Each arc eventually reaches a climax, and then finishes
with a step that is a final resolution. Each step reached earns the
character 2 XP. Character arcs are the most straightforward way that a
character earns XP. (Typically, PCs will earn about half their total
experience points from arcs or other GM awards.)

At character creation, a player can choose one character arc for their
PC at no cost. Players have the option to not choose one, but it’s
probably a good idea to do so. First and foremost, it is a
character-defining factor. If they begin the campaign with a desire to
find the woman who killed their brother, that says a lot about the
character: they had a brother, he was likely close to them, he had been
in at least one dangerous situation, and the character is probably
motivated by anger and hate, at least somewhat. Even after the character
finishes this first arc, they’ll undoubtedly have (at least one) more
because they can gain new arcs as the campaign progresses.

Once play begins, players can take on a new arc whenever they wish, as
fits the character’s ongoing story. Taking a new arc has a cost of 1 XP.
While there’s no hard limit on how many arcs a character can have at one
time, realistically most PCs couldn’t reasonably have more than three or
four.

However, as mentioned above, arcs have a beginning cost that must be
paid, reflecting the character’s devotion to the goal. The character
will earn this investment back (probably many times over) if the arc is
completed.

Character arcs are always player-driven. A GM cannot force one on a
character. That said, the events in the narrative often present story
arc opportunities and inspire character arcs for the PCs. It’s certainly
in the GM’s purview to suggest possible arcs related to the events going
on. For example, if the GM presents an encounter in which an NPC wishes
to learn from the PC, it might make sense to suggest taking the
Instruction arc. Whether or not the PC takes on the student, the player
doesn’t have to adopt the Instruction arc unless they want to.

At the end of a session, review the actions you took and describe how
they might equate to the completion of a step (or possibly more than one
step) in their character arc. If the GM agrees, the character gets their
reward.

(When in doubt, if one character accomplishes a step in their arc but
another character does not, the first character should get the 2 XP
reward, but the other character should probably still get, at minimum, 1
XP for the session.)

This chapter presents many sample character arcs (see below).

GM AWARDS

Sometimes, a group will have an adventure that doesn’t deal primarily
with a PC’s character arc. In this case, it’s a good idea for the GM to
award XP to that character for accomplishing other tasks. First and
foremost, awards should be based on discovery. Discovery can include
finding a significant new location, such as a hidden chamber, a secret
fortress, a lost land, a new planet, or an unexplored dimension. In this
fashion, PCs are explorers. Discovery can also include a new significant
aspect of a setting, such as a secret organization, a new religion, and
so on.

It can also mean finding a new procedure or device (something too big to
be considered a piece of equipment) or even previously unknown
information. This could include a source of magical power, a unique
teleportation device, or the cure for a plague. These are all
discoveries. The common thread is that the PCs discover something that
they can understand and put to use.

Last, depending on the GM’s outlook and the kind of campaign the group
wants to play, a discovery could be a secret, an ethical idea, an adage,
or even a truth.

(It’s a fine line, but ultimately the GM decides what constitutes a
discovery as opposed to just something weird in the course of an
adventure. Usually, the difference is, did the PCs successfully interact
with it and learn something about it? If so, it’s probably a discovery.)

Artifacts: When the group gains an artifact, award XP equal to the
artifact’s level and divide it among the PCs (minimum 1 XP for each
character). Round down if necessary. For example, if four PCs discover a
level 5 artifact, they each get 1 XP. Money, standard equipment, and
cyphers are not worth XP. (Experience point awards for artifacts should
usually apply even if the artifact was given to the PCs rather than
found, because often such gifts are the rewards for success.)

Miscellaneous Discoveries: Various other discoveries might grant 1 XP to
each PC involved.

Other Awards: If a character is focused on activities that don’t relate
to a character arc or a discovery, as a general rule, a mission should
be worth at least 1 XP per game session involved in accomplishing it.
For example, saving a family on an isolated farm beset by raiding
cultists might be worth 1 XP for each character. Of course, saving the
family doesn’t always mean killing the bad guys; it might mean
relocating them, parlaying with the cultists, or chasing off the
raiders.

SPENDING EXPERIENCE POINTS

Experience points are meant to be used. Hoarding them is not a good
idea; if a player accumulates more than 10 XP, the GM can require them
to spend some.

Generally, experience points can be spent in four ways: immediate
benefits, short- and medium-term benefits, long-term benefits, and
character advancement.

(Experience points should not be a goal unto themselves. Instead, they
are a game mechanic to simulate how—through experience, time, toil,
travail, and so on— characters become more skilled, more able, and more
powerful. Spending XP to explain a change in a character’s capabilities
that occurred in the course of the story, such as if the PC made a new
device or learned a new skill, isn’t a waste of XP—it’s what XP are
for.)

Immediate Benefits

The most straightforward way for a player to use XP is to reroll any
roll in the game—even one that they didn’t make. This costs 1 XP per
reroll, and the player chooses the best result. They can continue to
spend XP on rerolls, but this can quickly become an expensive
proposition. It’s a fine way to try to prevent disaster, but it’s not a
good idea to use a lot of XP to reroll a single action over and over.

A player can also spend 1 XP to refuse a GM intrusion.

Short- and Medium-Term Benefits

By spending 2 XP, a character can gain a skill—or, more rarely, an
ability—that provides a short-term benefit. Let’s say a character
notices that the computer terminals in the facility they’re infiltrating
are similar to those used by the company they once worked for. They
spend 2 XP and say that they have a great deal of experience in using
these. As a result, they are trained in operating (and breaking into)
these computers. This is just like being trained in computer use or
hacking, but it applies only to computers found in that particular
location. The skill is extremely useful in the facility, but nowhere
else.

Medium-term benefits are usually story based. For example, a character
can spend 2 XP while climbing through mountains and say that they have
experience with climbing in regions like these, or perhaps they spend
the XP after they’ve been in the mountains for a while and say that
they’ve picked up the feel for climbing there. Either way, from now on,
they’re trained in climbing in those mountains. This helps them now and
any time they return to the area, but they’re not trained in climbing
everywhere.

This method allows a character to get immediate training in a skill for
half the normal cost. (Normally, it costs 4 XP to become trained in a
skill.) It’s also a way to gain a new skill even if the PC has already
gained a new skill as a step toward attaining the next tier.

In rare cases, a GM might allow a character to spend 2 XP to gain an
entirely new ability—such as a device, a special ability, or a special
mental power—for a short time, usually no longer than the course of one
scenario. The player and the GM should agree on a story-based
explanation for the benefit. Perhaps the ability has a specific rare
requirement, such as a tool, a battery, a drug, or some kind of
treatment. For example, a character who wants to explore a submerged
location has several biotech enhancements, and they spend 2 XP to cobble
together a device that lets them breathe underwater. This gives them the
ability for a considerable length of time, but not permanently—the
device might work for only eight hours. Again, the story and the logic
of the situation dictate the parameters.

Long-Term Benefits

In many ways, the long-term benefits a PC can gain by spending XP are a
means of integrating the mechanics of the game with the story. Players
can codify things that happen to their characters by talking to the GM
and spending 3 XP.

Things that a PC can acquire as a long-term benefit can be thought of as
being story based, and they allow the player to have some narrative
control over the story. In the course of play, a player might decide
that their character gains a friend (a contact) or builds a log cabin (a
home). Because a player spent XP, however, they should have some agency
over what they’ve gained, and it shouldn’t be easily taken away. The
player should help come up with the details of the contact or the design
of their home.

It’s also possible to gain these benefits through events in the story,
without spending XP. The new contact comes to the PC and starts the
relationship. The new home is granted to them as a reward for service to
a powerful or wealthy patron, or maybe the character inherits the home
from a relative. However, because these came from the GM and not the
player (and no XP were spent), the player has no narrative control over
them and the GM makes up the details.

Long-term benefits can include the following.

Contact: The character gains a long-term NPC contact of
importance—someone who will help them with information, equipment, or
physical tasks. The player and GM should work out the details of the
relationship.

Home: The PC acquires a full-time residence. This can be an apartment in
a city, a cabin in the wilderness, a base in an ancient complex, or
whatever fits the situation. It should be a secure place where the PC
can leave their belongings and sleep soundly. Several characters could
combine their XP and buy a home together.

Title or job: The PC is granted a position of importance or authority.
It might come with responsibilities, prestige, and rewards, or it might
be an honorary title.

Wealth: The PC comes into a considerable amount of wealth, whether it’s
a windfall, an inheritance, or a gift. It might be enough to buy a home
or a title, but that’s not really the point. The main benefit is that
the PC no longer needs to worry about the cost of simple equipment,
lodging, food, and so on. This wealth could mean a set amount—perhaps
50,000 dollars (or whatever is appropriate in the setting)—or it could
bestow the ability to ignore minor costs, as decided by the player and
GM.

(GMs and players should work together to make XP awards and expenditures
fit the ongoing story. If a PC stays in a location for two months to
learn the inhabitants’ unique language, the GM might award the character
a few XP, which are then immediately spent to grant them the ability to
understand and speak that language.)

Character Advancement

Progressing to the next tier involves four steps. When a PC has spent 4
XP on each of the steps, they advance to the next tier and gain all the
type and focus benefits of that tier. The four steps can be purchased in
any order, but each can be purchased only once per tier. In other words,
a PC must buy all four steps and advance to the next tier before they
can buy the same steps again.

Increasing Capabilities: You gain 4 new points to add to your stat
Pools. You can allocate the points among your Pools however you wish.

Moving Toward Perfection: You add 1 to your Might Edge, your Speed Edge,
or your Intellect Edge (your choice).

Extra Effort: Your Effort score increases by 1.

Skills: Choose one skill other than attacks or defense, such as
climbing, jumping, persuading, sneaking, or history. You become trained
in that skill. You can also choose to be knowledgeable in a certain area
of study, such as history or geology. You can even choose a skill based
on your character’s special abilities. For example, if your character
can make an Intellect roll to blast an enemy with mental force, you can
become trained in that ability, easing the task of using it.

If you choose a skill that you are already trained in, you become
specialized in that skill, easing the task by two steps instead of one.
If you choose a skill that you have an inability in, the training and
the inability cancel each other out (you aren’t eased or hindered in
that task). For example, if you have an inability in perception,
becoming trained in that cancels out the inability.

(Once you’re specialized in a skill, you can’t improve your training in
that skill further (you can ease a task by up to two steps with
training). You can still make that task easier with assets and a few
rare abilities that don’t count as an asset or training.)

Other Options: Players can also spend 4 XP to purchase other special
options. Selecting one of these options counts as purchasing one of the
four stages necessary to advance to the next tier. The other three need
to be from the other categories. The special options are as follows:

Reduce the cost for wearing armor. This option lowers the Speed penalty
for wearing armor by 1.

Add 2 to your recovery rolls.

Select another focus ability available to you at tier 3. (You must be
tier 3 or higher to do this. Characters advancing beyond tier 6 can use
this option to select their other tier 6 focus ability.)

Select another character ability from your type, such as a tier 2
Warrior selecting Reload or Crushing Blow.

EQUAL ADVANCEMENT

It’s worthwhile if all characters advance through the six tiers at about
the same rate—an important issue for some players. A good GM can achieve
this result by carefully handing out XP rewards, some during play (which
will tend to get used immediately) and some after play concludes,
especially after completing a major story arc or quest so the GM can
hand out 4 XP in one go (which will tend to get used for advancement).
Many groups will discover while playing that equal advancement isn’t an
important issue in the Cypher System, but people should get to play the
game the way they want to play it.

TIER ADVANCEMENT IN THE CYPHER SYSTEM

Tiers in the Cypher System aren’t entirely like levels in other
roleplaying games. In the Cypher System, gaining tiers is not the
players’ only goal or the only measure of achievement. Starting
(first-tier) characters are already competent, and there are only six
tiers. Character advancement has a power curve, but it’s only steep
enough to keep things interesting. In other words, gaining a new tier is
cool and fun, but it’s not the only path to success or power. If you
spend all your XP on immediate, short-term, and medium-term benefits,
you will be different from someone who spends their points on long-term
benefits, but you will not be “behind” that character.

The general idea is that most characters will spend half their XP on
tier advancement and long-term benefits, and the rest on immediate
benefits and short- and medium-term benefits (which are used during
gameplay). Some groups might decide that XP earned during a game is to
be spent on immediate and short- and  
medium-term benefits (gameplay uses), and XP awarded between sessions
for discoveries is to be spent on character advancement (long-term
uses).

Ultimately, the idea is to make experience points into tools that the
players and the GM can use to shape the story and the characters, not
just a bookkeeping hassle.

SAMPLE CHARACTER ARCS

The rest of this chapter presents sample character arcs for PCs. The
writeup of each arc describes the parts involved in progressing through
the arc:

Opening: This sets the stage for the rest of the arc. It involves some
action, although that might just be the PC agreeing to do the task or
undertake the mission. It usually has no reward.

Step(s): This is the action required to move toward the climax. In story
terms, this is the movement through the bulk of the arc. It’s the
journey. The rising tension. Although there might be just one step,
there might also be many, depending on the story told. Each results in a
reward of 2 XP.

Climax: This is the finale—the point at which the PC likely succeeds or
fails at what they’ve set out to do. Not every arc ends with victory. If
the character is successful, they earn a reward of 4 XP. If they fail,
they still earn a reward of 2 XP. If a character fails the climax, they
very likely ignore the resolution.

Resolution: This is the wrap-up or denouement. It’s a time for the
character to reflect on what happened, tie up any loose ends, and figure
out what happens next. When things are more or less resolved, the
character earns a  
1 XP reward.

Within the arc, most of the time a part is probably optional, depending
on the situation—although it’s hard to envision most arcs without some
kind of opening, climax, or resolution. Steps other than the opening,
the climax, and the resolution can be done in any order.

Character arcs should always take at least weeks in game time, and no
more than two parts in an arc should be accomplished in a game session
(and most of the time, it should be one part, if any). If neither of
these two things is true, then it’s not really a character arc. You
can’t, for example, use the Creation arc to guide you through something
you can make in an hour or two.

The following are common character arcs that you can choose for your
character. If you and the GM want to make a new one, it should be fairly
easy after looking through these models.

(This chapter has a selection of sample character arcs, but you can
create your own too. The arcs are intentionally broad to encompass many
different characters and stories. For example, Revenge is a very simple
and straightforward character arc. The player who chooses this arc for
their character decides who they want revenge on, and why. It’s up to
the players and the GM to make the details fit.)

(Some players might not want to use character arcs. The GM, however, can
still use them as a benchmark for awarding XP. If the PCs are going off
to explore a strange planet, the GM can essentially give them the
Explore arc.)

AID A FRIEND

Someone needs your help.

When a PC friend takes a character arc, you can select this arc to help
them with whatever their arc is (if appropriate). The steps and climax
depend entirely on their chosen arc. If the friend is an NPC, the steps
and climax are lifted from another arc appropriate to whatever they seek
to do.

It’s difficult, but possible, to aid a friend with an arc even if that
friend is unwilling to accept (or is ignorant of) your help.

The cost and rewards for a character with this arc are the same as those
described in the original character arc.

Opening: Answering the Call. Offering to help (or responding to a
request for help).

Step(s) and Climax: Depends on the friend’s arc. Rewards are the same
for you as for the friend.

Resolution: You speak with your friend and learn if they are satisfied.
Together, you share what you’ve learned (if anything) and where you will
go from here.

ASSIST AN ORGANIZATION

You set out to accomplish something that will further an organization.
You’re probably allied with them or they are rewarding you for your help
in some fashion.

Opening: Responding to the Call. You work out all the details of what’s
expected of you, and what rewards (if any) you might get. You also get
the specifics of what’s required to join and advance.

Step: Sizing up the Task. This requires some action. A reconnaissance
mission. An investigation.

Step(s): Undertaking the Task. Because this arc can vary so widely based
on the task involved, there might be multiple steps like this one.

Climax: Completing the Task.

Resolution: Collecting your reward (if any) and conferring with the
people in the organization that you spoke to. Perhaps getting access to
higher-ranking people in the organization. You can choose to have your
connection to the organization increase rather than take the standard
reward.

AVENGE

Someone close to you or important to you in some way has been wronged.
The most overt version of this arc would be to avenge someone’s death.
Avenging is different than revenge, as revenge is personal—you are the
wronged party. But in the Avenge character arc, you are avenging a wrong
done to someone else.

Opening: Declaration. You publicly declare that you are going to avenge
the victim(s). This is optional.

Step(s): Tracking the Guilty. You track down the guilty party. This
might not be physically finding them if you already know where they are.
Instead, it might be discovering a way to get at them if they are
distant, difficult to reach, or well protected. This step might be
repeated multiple times, if applicable.

Step: Finding the Guilty. You finally find the guilty party, or find a
path or make a plan to reach them. Now all that’s left is to confront
them.

Climax: Confrontation. You confront the guilty party. This might be a
public accusation and demonstration of guilt, a trial, or an attack to
kill, wound, or apprehend them—whatever you choose to be appropriate.

Resolution: You resolve the outcome and the ramifications of the
confrontation and decide what to do next.

BIRTH

You are becoming a parent.

The Birth character arc assumes you already have a partner or a
surrogate. If you want your character to find a romantic partner or
spouse, you can use the Romance arc. And of course, nonhuman characters
might reproduce in other ways.

This arc is usually followed by the Raise a Child arc.

Opening: Impregnation.

Step: Finding a Caretaker. This might be a physician, midwife, doula, or
similar person. This is optional.

Step: Complication. A complication arises that threatens the pregnancy,
the birth parent, or both.

Step: Preparation. You prepare a place for the delivery as well as a
safe place for the infant to live once born.

Climax: Delivery. The baby is born. Success means the child survives.

Resolution: You get the baby to the place you have prepared and settle
in, deciding what to do next.

BUILD

You are going to build a physical structure—a house, a fortress, a
workshop, a defensive wall, and so on. This arc would also cover
renovating an existing structure or substantially adding to one. Of
course, this doesn’t have to be physical construction. You might build
something with spells or other supernatural abilities.

Opening: Make a Plan. This almost certainly involves literally drawing
up blueprints or plans.

Step(s): Find a Site. This might be extremely straightforward—a simple
examination of the site—or it might be an entire exploratory adventure.
(If the latter, it might involve multiple such steps.)

Step(s): Gather Materials. Depending on what you are building and what
it is made out of, this could involve multiple steps. There probably are
substantial costs involved as well.

Step(s): Construction. Depending on what you are building, this could
involve multiple steps. It might also take a considerable amount of time
and work.

Climax: Completion. The structure is finished.

Resolution: You put the structure to its desired use and see if it holds
up.

CLEANSE

Someone or something has been contaminated, probably by evil spirits,
radiation, a deadly virus, foul magic, or the like, and you want to rid
them of such influences or contaminants. This could also be a curse, a
possession, an infestation, or something else.

Opening: Analyzing the Threat. You determine the nature of the
contamination.

Step: Find the Solution. Almost every contamination has its own
particular solution, and this likely involves research and consultation.

Step: Getting Ready. The solution probably involves materials, spells,
or other things that you must gather and prepare.

Climax: The Cleansing. You confront the contamination.

Resolution: You reflect on the events that have transpired and what
effects they might have on the future. How can you keep this from
happening again?

CREATION

You want to make something. This might be a magic item, a painting, a
novel, or a machine.

Opening: Make a Plan. You figure out what you need, what you’re going to
do, and how you’re going to do it.

Step(s): Gather Materials. Depending on what you are creating and what
it is made out of, this could involve multiple steps. There probably are
substantial costs involved as well.

Step(s): Progress. Depending on what you are creating, this could
involve multiple steps. It might also take a considerable amount of time
and work.

Climax: Completion. It’s finished! Is it what you wanted? Does it work?

Resolution: You think about what you have learned from the process and
use or enjoy the fruits of your labor.

DEFEAT A FOE

Someone stands in your way or is threatening you. You must overcome the
challenge they represent. Defeat doesn’t always mean kill or even fight.
Defeating a foe could mean beating them in a chess match or in
competition for a desired mentor.

Opening: Sizing up the Competition. This requires some action. A
reconnaissance mission. An investigation.

Step: Investigation. This requires some action. A reconnaissance
mission. An investigation.

Step(s): Diving In. You travel toward your opponent, overcome their
lackeys, or take steps to reach them so you can confront them. This step
can take many forms, and there might be more than one such step. This
step is always active.

Climax: Confrontation. The contest, challenge, fight, or confrontation
occurs.

Resolution: You reflect on what you’ve learned and what the consequences
of your actions might be.

DEFENSE

A person, place, or thing is threatened, and you want to protect it.

Opening: Analyze the Situation. What are you defending, and what threats
are involved?

Step: Account for Your Resources. How are you going to defend?

Step(s): Fend Off Danger. The forces threatening what you are protecting
probably make an initial threat that you’ll have to defeat. It’s not the
main threat, though. There might be multiple such initial threats.

Climax: Protect. The true threat reveals itself and you confront it.

Resolution: A time for reflection on everything that occurred, and an
assessment of the person, place, or thing’s safety going forward.

DEVELOP A BOND

You want to get closer to another character. This might be to make a
friend, find a mentor, or establish a contact in a position of power. It
might be to turn a friend into a much closer friend. The character might
be an NPC or a PC.

Opening: Getting to Know You. You learn what you can about the other
character.

Step: Initial Attempt. You attempt to make contact. This might involve
sending messages or gifts through a courier, using an intermediary, or
just going up and saying hello, depending on the situation.

Step(s): Building a Relationship. There might be many such steps as you
develop the relationship.

Climax: Bond. You succeed or fail at forging the bond.

Resolution: You enjoy the fruits of your new relationship.

ENTERPRISE

You want to create and run a business or start an organization. Maybe
you’re a craftsperson who wants to sell your creations. Maybe you like
baking and you want to start a catering service. Or maybe you want to
start a secret society or found a school to teach young mutants how to
use their powers. You’ll almost certainly have to make new connections,
find (and somehow pay for) a location, and deal with all manner of
administrative duties.

Opening: Drawing up a Plan. What’s your goal, and how are you going to
achieve it?

Step: Account for Your Resources. How much financing does the enterprise
need compared to what you’ve got? If you need more, how will you get it?
How many people other than yourself are needed to begin, and how many
will you need to sustain things once they are up and running?

Step: Finding a Location. You probably need a place to run your
enterprise—a store, a workshop, a base of operations, and so on. You
find a location and look into what it will take to buy or rent it.

Step(s): Building the Enterprise. You procure the needed equipment or
personnel. You make the connections and deals to get things started. You
obtain important permits or other legal documents. You test new
products. You actually start the business. Each of these developments
(and likely others) can be counted as a separate step, so there will be
many steps.

Climax: Profit and Loss. You determine whether your enterprise will take
off and carry on into the future, or fall apart before it gets a chance
to blossom. This occurs in a single dramatic moment—your first major
client, your organization’s first big meeting or mission, or whatever
else is appropriate.

Resolution: A time for reflection on everything that occurred, and how
you’re going to move forward.

ESTABLISHMENT

You want to prove yourself as someone of importance. This can take many
forms—socially, within your order, financially, or even romantically.

Opening: Assessment. You assess yourself as well as who you need to
prove yourself to.

Step(s): Appearances Matter. You improve your look. Enhance your
wardrobe. Spruce up your house. Whatever it takes to get attention from
the right people. There might be many such steps.

Step(s): Self-Aggrandizement. You need to get the word out to get people
talking about you. There might be many such steps.

Climax: Grabbing Attention. You do something big, like host a party for
influential people or produce a play that you wrote. You make a big
splash or a big crash.

Resolution: You reflect on what you did and where you go from here.

EXPLORE

Something out there is unknown and you want to explore its secrets. This
is most likely an area of wilderness, a new planet, an otherworldly
dimension, or something similar.

Opening: Make a Plan. Not only do you draw up a plan for your
exploration, but if appropriate, you also make a formal declaration to
relevant parties of what you’re going to do.

Step(s): Gather Resources. You get the supplies, vehicles, and help you
need. Depending on where you are going and what is required, this could
involve multiple steps. There probably are substantial costs involved as
well.

Step(s): Travel. You go where you wish to explore. There might be many
such steps, depending on how long it takes to get there.

Step(s): Exploration. This is the meat of the arc, but it’s probably a
series of small moves and minor victories. There might be many such
steps.

Climax: Conquest. You make the big discovery or truly master the area.
You might not have explored every inch of the place, but if you are
successful, you can claim to be done.

Resolution: You return home and possibly share your findings.

FALL FROM GRACE

This is an odd character arc in that it’s (presumably) not something
that a character would want. It is something that a player selects on a
meta level for the character because it makes for an interesting story.
It also sets up the potential for future arcs, such as Redemption. It’s
important that this involve actions you take. For example, you fall into
substance abuse. You treat people badly. You make mistakes that endanger
others. In other words, the fall isn’t orchestrated by someone else—it’s
all your own doing.

Opening: The Descent. Things go bad.

Step(s): Further Descent. Things get worse. Depending on the situation,
this might involve many steps.

Step: Lashing Out. You treat others poorly as you descend.

Climax: Rock Bottom. There is no chance for success here. Only failure.

Resolution: You wallow in your own misery.

FINISH A GREAT WORK

Something that was begun in the past must now be completed. This might
involve destroying an evil artifact, finishing the construction of a
monument, developing the final steps of a cure for a disease, or
uncovering a lost temple forgotten to the ages.

Opening: Assessing the Past. You look at what has come before and where
it still needs to go. This almost certainly involves some real research.

Step: Conceive a Plan. You make a plan on how to move forward.

Step(s): Progress. You make significant progress or overcome a barrier
to completion. This may involve multiple such steps.

Climax: Completion. This involves the big finish to the past work.

Resolution: You reflect on what you did and where you go from here.

GROWTH

Willingly or unwillingly, you are going to change. This is another meta
arc. It’s less about a goal and more about character development. While
it’s possible that the growth involved is intentional, in most people’s
lives and stories, it is emergent. A character might become less
selfish, braver, a better leader, or experience some other form of
growth.

Opening: The Beginning. Change usually begins slowly, in a small, almost
imperceptible way.

Step(s): Change. Growth involves many small steps.

Step: Overcoming an Obstacle. The temptation to resort to your old ways
is always present.

Climax: Self-Evident Change. This is a dramatic about-face. This is the
moment where you do something the “old you” would never have done, and
it has a profound effect on you and those around you. With either
success or failure, growth is possible.

Resolution: You recognize the change in yourself and move forward.

INSTRUCTION

You teach a pupil. You have knowledge on a topic and are willing to
share. This can be a skill, an area of lore, a combat style, or the use
of a special ability. This is usually a fairly long-term arc. Sometimes
teaching a pupil is a side matter, and sometimes the pupil takes on more
of an apprentice role and spends a great deal of time with you,
traveling with you and perhaps even living in your house (or you living
in theirs).

Opening: Taking on the Student.

Step: Getting to Know Them. You assess your pupil’s strengths and
weaknesses and try to get an idea of what they need to learn and how you
can teach it to them.

Step(s): The Lessons. Teaching is often a slow, gradual process.

Step: Breakdown. Many times, a student needs to have a moment of crisis
to really learn something. Maybe they get dejected, or maybe they rebel
against your teaching techniques.

Climax: Graduation. This is when you recognize that the pupil has
learned what they need. It usually comes at a dramatic moment.

Resolution: You and the pupil say your goodbyes, and you look toward the
future.

JOIN AN ORGANIZATION

You want to join an organization. This might be a military organization,
a corporation, a secret society, a religion, or something else.

Opening: Getting the Details. You learn all you can about the
organization and how one becomes a member.

Step(s): Making a Contact. Friends on the inside are always important.

Step(s): Performing a Deed. The organization might want to test your
worth, or this might be a ceremony you must take part in. It might
include paying some sort of dues or fee. Or all of these things.

Climax: Proving Your Worth. This is the point at which you attempt to
show the organization that they would be better off with you as a
member.

Resolution: You consider your efforts and assess what your membership
gets you.

JUSTICE

You try to right a wrong or bring a wrongdoer to justice.

Opening: Declaration. You publicly declare that you are going to bring
justice in this situation. This is optional.

Step(s): Tracking the Guilty. You track down the guilty party, assuming
there is one. This might not be physically finding them if you already
know where they are. Instead, it might be discovering a way to get at
them if they are distant, difficult to reach, or well protected. This
step might be repeated multiple times, if applicable.

Step: Helping the Victim. Righting a wrong does not always involve
confronting a wrongdoer. Part of it might be about helping those who
were wronged.

Climax: Confrontation. You confront the guilty party. This might be a
public accusation and demonstration of guilt, a trial, or an attack to
kill, wound, or apprehend them—whatever you choose to be appropriate.

Resolution: You resolve the outcome and ramifications of the
confrontation and decide what to do next.

LEARN

You want to learn something. This isn’t the same as the Uncover a Secret
arc, in which you’re looking for a bit of information. This is a skill
or whole area of knowledge you want to gain proficiency with. This is
learning a new language, how to play an instrument, or how to be a good
cook. Thus, it’s not about gaining a level or rank in climbing, but
learning to be an experienced mountaineer.

Opening: Focusing on the Problem.

Step: Finding a Teacher or a Way to Teach Yourself. Now you can truly
begin.

Step(s): Learn. Depending on what you’re learning, this could involve
one step or quite a few.

Climax: The Test. You put your new knowledge to the test in a real
situation.

Resolution: You relax a bit and decide what to do next.

MASTER A SKILL

You’re skilled, but you want to become the best. This arc might
logically follow the Learn arc. As with the Learn arc, this can involve
any kind of training at all, not just a skill.

Opening: Finding the Path. You’ve learned the basics. Now it’s time for
the advanced material.

Step: Discovering a Master. You find a master to help you become a
master.

Step(s): Learn. Depending on what you’re mastering, this could involve
one step or quite a few.

Step: The Last Step. Eventually, you realize that even a master cannot
teach you the last step. You must learn it on your own.

Climax: The Test. You put your mastery to the test in a real
situation—and considering your goal, it’s probably a very important
situation.

Resolution: You relax a bit and decide what to do next.

MYSTERIOUS BACKGROUND

You don’t know who your parents were, but you want to find out. The
mystery might be something other than your parentage, but that’s a
common theme in this kind of arc. You want to know where you come
from—there’s some kind of mystery in your past.

Opening: Beginning the Search.

Step: Research. You look into your own family background, if possible.

Step(s): Investigation. You talk to people who might know. You follow
clues.

Climax: Discovery. You discover the secret of your own background. You
determine if what you learn is good or bad, but either way discovery
means success.

Resolution: You contemplate how this new knowledge sits with you.

NEW DISCOVERY

You want to invent a new device, process, spell, or something similar. A
cure for a heretofore unknown disease? An invocation with a result
you’ve never heard of before? A method for getting into an impregnable
vault? Any of these and more could be your discovery. While similar to
the Creation arc and the Learn arc, the New Discovery arc involves
blazing a new trail. No one can teach you what you want to know. You’ve
got to do it on your own.

Opening: The Idea. You draw up plans for the thing you want to invent or
discover.

Step: Research. You learn what people have done before and recognize
where they fell short.

Step(s): Trial and Error. You test your hypothesis. This often ends in
many failures before you get a success.

Climax: Eureka! It’s time to put the discovery to the true test.

Resolution: You reflect on your discovery and probably compile your
notes and write it all down, for posterity’s sake if nothing else.

RAISE A CHILD

You raise a child to adulthood. It can be your biological child or one
you adopt. It can even be a child taken under your wing, more a young
protégé than a son or daughter. This is obviously a very long-term arc.

Opening: Sharing Your Home. The child now lives with you.

Step: Care and Feeding. You learn to meet the child’s basic needs.

Step(s): Basic Instruction. You teach them to walk, talk, and read. You
teach them to care for themselves.

Step(s): The Rewards Are Many. The child loves you. Relies on you.
Trusts you. Eventually, helps you.

Step(s): Ethical Instruction. You instill your basic ethics in the
child, hoping that they will mature into an adult you can be proud of.

Climax: Adulthood. At some point the child leaves the proverbial nest.
You determine, at this point, your own success or failure.

Resolution: You reflect on the memories you have made.

RECOVER FROM A WOUND (OR TRAUMA)

You need to heal. This isn’t just for healing simple damage. This
involves recovering from a major debilitating injury, illness, or shock.
Severe damage, the loss of a body part, and emotional trauma all fall
into this category.

Opening: Rest. The first thing you need to do is rest.

Step: Self Care. You take care of your own needs.

Step: Getting Aid. Someone helps.

Step: Medicine. Some kind of drug, cure, poultice, potion, or remedy
aids your recovery.

Step: Therapy. With the help of someone else, you exercise your injury
or cope with your trauma.

Climax: Acceptance or Recovery. You try to move on and use what has been
damaged (or learn how to function without it).

Resolution: You get on with your life.

REDEMPTION

You’ve done something very wrong, but you want to atone and make it
right again. This is like the Justice arc or the Undo a Wrong arc,
except you are the wrongdoer. This could be a follow-up to the Fall From
Grace arc.

Opening: Regret. You are determined to rebuild, recover, and restore.

Step: Forgiveness. You apologize and ask for forgiveness.

Step: Identifying the Needs. You determine what needs to be done to
atone for your transgression.

Climax: Making Good. You perform an act that you hope will redeem your
past misdeed.

Resolution: You reflect on what has happened but now look to the future.

REPAY A DEBT

You owe someone something, and it’s time to make good.

Opening: Debts Come Due. You determine to do what is needed to make good
on the debt. It might involve repaying money, but more appropriately
it’s performing a deed or a series of deeds.

Step: Talking It Over. You discuss the matter with the person you owe,
if possible. You ensure that what you’re doing is what they want.

Climax: Repayment. Either you do something to earn the money or goods
you owe, or you undertake a major task that will compensate the other
person.

Resolution: You relax knowing that your debt is repaid, and you look to
the future.

RESCUE

Someone or something of great importance has been taken, and you want to
get them or it back.

Opening: Heeding the Call. You determine what has happened, and who or
what is missing.

Step: Tracking. You discover who has taken them, and where.

Step: Travel. You go to where they are being held and get information on
the location and who is involved. Maybe make a plan.

Climax: Rescue Operation. You go in and get them.

Resolution: You return them home.

RESTORATION

You’re down but not out. You want to restore your good name. Recover
what you’ve lost. Rebuild what has been destroyed. You’ve fallen down or
have been knocked down, but either way you want to pick yourself up.
This is a possible follow-up to the Fall From Grace arc.

Opening: Vow to Yourself. You are determined to rebuild, recover, and
restore.

Step(s): Work. You rebuild, recover, and restore. If all your money was
stolen, you make more. If your house was destroyed, you rebuild it. If
your reputation was tarnished, you perform deeds that restore your good
name.

Climax: The Final Act. You undertake one last major task that will bring
things back to where they were (or close to it). A lot is riding on this
moment.

Resolution: You enjoy a return to things the way they were before.

REVENGE

Someone did something that harmed you. Unlike the Avenge arc, this arc
probably isn’t about tracking down a murderer, but it might involve
pursuing someone who stole from you, hurt you, or otherwise brought you
grief. The key is that it’s personal. Otherwise, use the Justice arc.

Opening: Vow. You swear revenge.

Step(s): Finding a Clue. You find a clue to tracking down the culprit.

Climax: Confrontation. You confront the culprit.

Resolution: You deal with the aftermath of the confrontation and move
on. You think about whether you are satisfied by gaining your revenge.

ROMANCE

You want to strike up a relationship with a romantic partner. Perhaps
you have a specific person in mind, or maybe you’re just interested in a
relationship in general.

Opening(s): Caught Someone’s Eye. You meet someone you are interested
in. (Since this can be short-lived, it’s possible to have this opening
occur more than once.)

Step(s): Courtship. You begin seeing the person regularly. Although not
every “date” is a step in the arc, significant moments are, and there
may be a few of them.

Climax: Commitment. You may or may not be interested in a monogamous
relationship. Regardless, you and your love have made some kind of
commitment to each other.

Resolution: You think about the future. Marriage? Children? These are
only some of the possibilities.

SOLVE A MYSTERY

Different from the Learn arc and the Uncover a Secret arc, this arc is
about solving a crime or a similar action committed in the fairly recent
past. It’s not about practice or study, but about questions and answers.
In theory, the mystery doesn’t have to be a crime. It might be “Why is
this strange caustic substance leaking into my basement?”

Opening: Pledging to Solve the Mystery.

Step: Research. You get some background.

Step(s): Investigation. You ask questions. You look for clues. You cast
divinations. This likely encompasses many such steps.

Climax: Discovery. You come upon what you believe to be the solution to
the mystery.

Resolution: In this step, which is far more active than most
resolutions, you confront the people involved in the mystery with what
you’ve discovered, or you use the information in some way (such as
taking it to the proper authorities).

THEFT

Someone else has something you want.

Opening: Setting Your Sights. You make a plan.

Step: Casing the Joint. You scout out the location of the thing (or
learn its location).

Step(s): Getting to the Object. Sometimes, many steps are involved
before you reach the object you wish to take. For example, if, in order
to steal something from a vault, you need to approach one of the guards
while they are off duty and bribe them to look the other way when you
break in, that is covered in this step.

Climax: The Attempt. You make your heist.

Resolution: You decide what to do with the thing you’ve stolen and
contemplate the repercussions you might face for stealing it.

TRAIN A CREATURE

You want to domesticate and train an animal or other creature. While the
beast doesn’t need to be wild, it must not already be domesticated and
trained.

Opening: Getting Acquainted. You get to know the creature a bit, and it
gets to know you.

Step: Research. You get information on the type of creature or advice
from others who have trained one.

Step: Domestication. After some work, the creature is no longer a threat
to you or anyone else, and it can live peacefully in your home or
wherever you wish.

Step(s): Training. Each time you use this step, you teach the creature a
new, significant command that it will obey regularly and immediately.

Climax: Completion. Believing the creature’s training to be complete,
you put it in a situation where that is put to the test.

Resolution: You reflect on the experience.

TRANSFORMATION

You want to be different in a specific way. Because the Growth arc
covers internal change, this one focuses primarily on external change.
This could take many forms, and probably varies greatly by genre. In
some settings, it could even be death, which might turn you into a
ghost. For the change to be an arc, it should be difficult and perhaps
risky.

Opening: Deciding on the Transformation.

Step: Research. You look into how the change can be made and what it
entails.

Step(s): Investigation. This is an active step toward making the change.
It might involve getting more information, materials or ingredients, or
something else.

Climax: Change. You make the change, with some risk of failure or
disaster.

Resolution: You contemplate how this change affects you going forward.

UNCOVER A SECRET

There is knowledge out there that you want. It could be an attempt to
find and learn a specific special ability. This could also be a hunt for
a lost password or a key that will open a sealed door, the true name of
a devil, the secret background of an important person, or how the
ancients constructed that strange monolith.

Opening: Naming the Secret. You give your goal a name. “I am seeking the
lost martial art of the Khendrix, who could slice steel with their bare
hands.”

Step(s): Research. You scour libraries and old tomes for clues and
information.

Step(s): Investigation. You talk to people to gain clues and
information.

Step(s): Tracking. You track down the source of the secret information
and travel to it.

Climax: Revelation. You find and attempt to use the secret, whatever
that entails.

Resolution: You contemplate how this secret affects you and the world.

UNDO A WRONG

Someone did something horrible, and its ramifications are still felt,
even if it happened long ago. You seek to undo the damage, or at least
stop it from continuing.

This is different from the Justice arc because this isn’t about justice
(or even revenge)—it’s about literally undoing something bad that
happened in the past, such as a great library being burned to the
ground, a sovereign people being driven from their land, and so on.

Opening: Vowing to Put Right What Once Went Wrong.

Step: Make a Plan. You learn all you can about the situation and then
make a plan to put things right.

Step(s): Progress. This is an active step toward undoing the wrong. It
might involve finding something, defeating someone, destroying
something, building something, or almost anything else, depending on the
circumstances.

Climax: Change. You face the challenge of the former wrong, and either
overcome it or fail.

Resolution: You reflect on what you’ve accomplished and think about the
future.

Genres

The Cypher System can be used to play in many settings. This chapter
provides additional information and rules for fantasy, modern, science
fiction, horror, romance, superheroes, post-apocalyptic, fairy tale, and
historical genres.

FANTASY TYPES

For our purposes, fantasy is any genre that has magic, or something so
inexplicable it might as well be magic. The sort of core default of this
type is Tolkienesque fantasy, also known as second-world fantasy because
it includes a completely new world not our own. Big fantasy epics like
those penned by J. R. R. Tolkien (hence the name), C. S. Lewis, George
R. R. Martin, Stephen R. Donaldson, David Eddings, Ursula K. Le Guin,
and others are indicative of this genre. It usually involves swords,
sorcery, nonhuman species (such as elves, dwarves, helborn, and
half-giants), and epic struggles.

Of course, fantasy might also involve the modern world, with creatures
of myth and sorcerers dwelling among us. It might involve mythic
traditions of any number of cultures (elves, dwarves, and the like,
usually being decidedly European) or bear little resemblance to anything
on Earth, past or present. It might even involve some of the trappings
of science fiction, with spaceships and laser guns amid the wizardry and
swords (this is often called science fantasy).

Fantasy can also be defined by the amount of fantasy elements within it.
A second-world fantasy filled with wizards, ghosts, dragons, curses, and
gods is referred to as high fantasy. Fantasy with a firmer grounding in
reality as we know it in our world is low fantasy. (In fact, low fantasy
often takes place in our world, or in our world’s distant past, like the
stories of Conan.) No single element indicates concretely that a given
fantasy is high or low. It’s the prevalence of those elements.

The point is, there are many, many types of fantasy.

FANTASY ARTIFACTS

In many ways, fantasy is the genre for artifacts. All magic items—wands
that shoot lightning, magic carpets, singing swords, rings that make the
wearer invisible, and so on—are artifacts. Below are a few sample
artifacts to give a template for GMs to follow. Those running a fantasy
campaign will likely want to create many magic artifacts.

ANGELIC WARD

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Tiny figurine of a winged angel

Effect: Once activated, the figurine’s spirit emerges and becomes
semisolid as a glowing, human-sized winged angel. It follows within 3
feet (1 m) of the figurine owner. Anything within long range that
attacks the owner is attacked by the angelic ward, which sends out a
bolt of flesh-rotting energy, doing damage equal to the artifact’s
level. Once activated, it functions for a day.

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

RING OF DRAGON’S FLIGHT

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Green iron ring that appears like a dragon wound around the finger

Effect: When the wearer activates the ring, dragon wings unfurl from
their back, and for one minute the wearer can fly up to long range. The
ring does not confer the ability to hover or make fine adjustments while
in flight.

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

SOULFLAYING WEAPON

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Weapon of any type, with engraved glowing runes denoting
soulflaying

Effect: This weapon functions as a normal weapon of its kind. The
wielder can use an action to activate its soulflaying magic for one
minute. During that time, if the weapon scores a hit, it inflicts normal
damage, plus 3 additional points of Intellect damage on all creatures
that have souls (not automatons, mindless undead, or the like).

Depletion: 1 in 1d100

SPELLBOOK OF THE AMBER MAGE

Level: 1d6

Form: Weighty tome bound in amber filled with pages of spell runes

Effect: When the user incants from the spellbook and succeeds at a level
3 Intellect-based task, the user can attempt to trap a creature within
long range inside a block of amber. Only creatures whose level is equal
to or lower than the artifact’s level can be targeted. A creature
successfully caught is preserved in perfect stasis until the encasing
amber is broken away (the amber has 10 points of health per level of the
artifact).

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

WAND OF FIREBOLTS

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Wand of red wood 8 inches (20 cm) long, carved with intricate
flamelike images

Effect: When activated, the wand looses a blast of fire at a chosen
target within short range, inflicting damage equal to the artifact’s
level.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Fantasy SPECIES DESCRIPTORS

In a high fantasy setting, some GMs may want dwarves and elves to be
mechanically different from humans. Below are some possibilities for how
this might work.

VARIANT RULE: TWO DESCRIPTORS

By having dwarf, elf, or other species take the place of a character’s
descriptor, it creates a situation where only human characters have the
variability of choosing a descriptor that suits their personality. The
GM might instead allow all human characters to have two descriptors, and
nonhuman characters to have a standard descriptor in addition to their
species descriptor.

Sometimes contradictory descriptors might weaken or negate each other’s
benefits and drawbacks. If one descriptor gives training in a skill and
another gives an inability in that skill, they cancel each other out and
the character doesn’t have any modifier for that skill at all.

DESCRIPTORS AS SPECIES 

If a player wants to play a nearly human species without any exceptional
or unique special abilities, it’s easy for a GM to pick an appropriate
descriptor and use it as that species’ descriptor. A greyhound-like
species might have the Fast descriptor.

CATFOLK

You are unmistakably feline. Your people have fur; large, pointed ears;
sharp teeth and claws; and even tails. You are nimble, graceful, and
quick. An ancient and sophisticated culture, your people have their own
language, customs, and traditions developed in relative seclusion over
the centuries. Neither conquerors nor conquered, the success of your
society has come from the fact that you have given most others a wide
berth. As a people, you almost never get involved in wars or similar
matters, which has given other cultures the idea that you are aloof,
unapproachable, or mysterious. As long as they leave you alone, what
they think is fine with you. 

You gain the following characteristics: 

Agile: +4 to your Speed Pool. Skill: You are trained in climbing and
balance tasks. 

Bared Claws: Even unarmed, your claws are light weapons that inflict 4
points of damage. 

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure. 

1\. You were curious as to what the other PCs were up to. 

2\. You needed to get out of town, and the PCs were going in the same
direction as you. 

3\. You are interested in making a profit, and the other PCs seem to
have a lead on doing just that. 

4\. It seemed like a lark.

DRAGONFOLK

You have scales, fangs, claws, and magic—gifts of the dragons. You might
have been born of dragonfolk parents, willingly transformed in a magical
ceremony, or chosen by a dragon to be their agent or champion. You have
a great destiny before you, but it is your choice whether to make it
your own or bend to the will of those who made you what you are. Some
people mistrust or fear you, and others consider you a prophet or wish
to exploit your power for their own goals. 

You gain the following characteristics: 

Sturdy: +2 to your Might Pool. Skill: You are trained in intimidation

Dragonbreath (3 Might points): You breathe out a blast of energy in an
immediate area. Choose one type of energy (arcane, cold, fire, thorn,
and so on); the blast inflicts 2 points of damage of this kind of energy
(ignores Armor) to all creatures or objects within the area. Because
this is an area attack, adding Effort to increase your damage works
differently than it does for single-target attacks. If you apply a level
of Effort to increase the damage, add 2 points of damage for each
target, and even if you fail your attack roll, all targets in the area
still take 1 point of damage. Action. 

Draconic Resistance: You gain +2 Armor against the type of energy you
create with your dragonbreath. 

Scaly: +1 to Armor. Inability: You have difficulty relating to
non-dragons. Tasks to persuade non-dragons are hindered. 

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You believe the other PCs can help you solve a mystery about your
heritage. 

2\. You needed to get out of town, and the PCs were going in the same
direction as you. 

3\. Your creator, master, or mentor told you to help the PCs. 

4\. You want to make a name for yourself, and the other PCs seem
competent and compatible.

DWARF

You’re a stocky, broad-shouldered, bearded native of the mountains and
hills. You’re also as stubborn as the stone in which the dwarves carve
their homes under the mountains. Tradition, honor, pride in smithcraft
and warcraft, and a keen appreciation of the wealth buried under the
roots of the world are all part of your heritage. Those who wish you ill
should be wary of your temper. When dwarves are wronged, they never
forget.

You gain the following characteristics:

Stalwart: +2 to your Might Pool.

Skill: You are trained in Might defense rolls.

Skill: You are trained in tasks related to stone, including sensing
stonework traps, knowing the history of a particular piece of
stonecraft, and knowing your distance beneath the surface.

Skill: You are practiced in using axes.

Skill: You are trained in using the tools required to shape and mine
stone.

Vulnerability: When you fail an Intellect defense roll to avoid damage,
you take 1 extra point of damage.

Additional Equipment: You have an axe.

1\. You found the PCs wandering a maze of tunnels and led them to
safety.

2\. The PCs hired you to dig out the entrance to a buried ruin.

3\. You tracked down the thieves of your ancestor’s tomb and found they
were the PCs. Instead of killing them, you joined them.

4\. Before dwarves settle down, they need to see the world.

ELF

You haunt the woodlands and deep, natural realms, as your people have
for millennia. You are the arrow in the night, the shadow in the glade,
and the laughter on the wind. As an elf, you are slender, quick,
graceful, and long lived. You manage the sorrows of living well past
many mortal lifetimes with song, wine, and an appreciation for the deep
beauties of growing things, especially trees, which can live even longer
than you do.

You gain the following characteristics:

Agile: +2 to your Speed Pool.

Long-Lived: Your natural lifespan (unless tragically cut short) is
thousands of years.

Skill: You are specialized in tasks related to perception.

Skill: You are practiced in using one bow variety of your choice.

Skill: You are trained in stealth tasks. In areas of natural woodland,
you are specialized in stealth tasks.

Fragile: When you fail a Might defense roll to avoid damage, you take 1
extra point of damage.

Additional Equipment: You have a bow and a quiver of arrows to go with
it.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. Before putting an arrow in the forest intruders, you confronted them
and met the PCs, who were on an important quest.

2\. Your heart yearned for farther shores, and the PCs offered to take
you along to new places.

3\. Your home was burned by strangers from another place, and you
gathered the PCs along the way as you tracked down the villains.

4\. An adventure was in the offing, and you didn’t want to be left
behind.

GNOME

You are curious and love discovering ways to turn found things into art,
tools, or weapons. You might be a sculptor, smith, artist, chef,
storyteller, or inventor. Alchemy, magic, and engineering fascinate you.
Other beings may see you as a strange mix of a nature-loving elf and a
craft-obsessed dwarf, but you and your kind are unique people with a
passion for life, exploration, and creation. 

You gain the following characteristics: 

Genius: +2 to your Intellect Pool. 

Skill: You are trained in two skills that suit your creative nature,
such as alchemy, smithing, poetry, cooking, woodcarving, or pottery.

Natural Affinity: You gain one of the following abilities:
Communication, Eyes Adjusted, or Minor Illusion.

something interesting. 

4\. You owe one of the PCs a favor for a useful gift in the past.

HALF-GIANT

You stand at least 12 feet (4 m) tall and tower over everyone around
you. Whether you are a full-blooded giant or merely have giant heritage
from large ancestors, you’re massive. Always large for your age, it
became an issue only once you reached puberty and topped 7 feet (2 m) in
height, and kept growing from there.

You gain the following characteristics:

Tough: +4 to your Might Pool.

Mass and Strength: You inflict +1 point of damage with your melee
attacks and attacks with thrown weapons.

Breaker: Tasks related to breaking things by smashing them are eased.

3\. The PCs helped you escape a nether realm where other giants were
imprisoned by the gods.

4\. You kept the PCs from being discovered by hiding them behind your
bulk when they were on the run.

HALFLING

Three feet tall and proud, you are fond of the comforts of home but
itching for a little adventure now and then. Small and quick, you have a
way of getting along with everyone. You might have been raised in a
halfling village, a mixed community where humans and the small folk work
and eat side by side as friends, or a less welcoming environment where
your people get things done using deception and criminal activity. You
and humans have a lot in common—you’re just more compact and efficient
about it. 

You gain the following characteristics: 

Agile: +2 to your Speed Pool. 

Skill: You are trained in pleasant social interactions. 

Skill: You are trained in stealth.

Might-based tasks are hindered. 

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure. 

1\. You were fleeing someone and literally ran into the other PCs. 

2\. You were invited (or invited yourself) as a good luck charm. 

3\. You were tricked into going with the other PCs or were brought along
despite your very reasonable objections. 

4\. You’re very protective of another PC and want to make sure they get
through the upcoming challenges.

HELBORN

Demons of the underworld sometimes escape. When they do, they can taint
human bloodlines. Things like you are the result of such unnatural
unions. Part human and part something else, you are an orphan of a
supernatural dalliance. Thanks to your unsettling appearance, you’ve
probably been forced to make your own way in a world that often fears
and resents you. Some of your kin have large horns, tails, and pointed
teeth. Others are more subtle or more obvious in their differences—a
shadow of a knife-edge in their face and a touch that withers normal
plants, a little too much fire in their eyes and a scent of ash in the
air, a forked tongue, goatlike legs, or the inability to cast a shadow.
Work with the GM on your particular helborn appearance.

You gain the following characteristics.

Devious: +2 to your Intellect Pool.

Skill: You are trained in tasks related to magic lore and lore of the
underworld.

Fire Adapted: +2 to Armor against damage from fire only.

Helborn Magic: You are inherently magical. Choose one low-tier ability
from the Abilities chapter. If the GM agrees it is appropriate, you gain
that ability as part of your helborn heritage, and can use it like any
other type or focus ability.

Inner Evil: You sometimes lose control and risk hurting your allies.
When you roll a 1, the GM has the option to intrude by indicating that
you lose control. Once you’ve lost control, you attack any and every
living creature within short range. You can’t spend Intellect points for
any reason other than to try to regain control (a difficulty 2 task).
After you regain control, you suffer a –1 penalty to all rolls for one
hour.

Inability: People distrust you. Tasks to persuade or deceive are
hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You were nearly beaten to death by people who didn’t like your look,
but the PCs found and revived you.

2\. The PCs hired you for your knowledge of magic.

3\. Every so often you get visions of people trapped in the underworld.
You tracked those people down and found the PCs, who’d never visited the
underworld. Yet.

4\. Your situation at home became untenable because of how people
reacted to your looks. You joined the PCs to get away.

LIZARDFOLK

You are from a long line of fierce reptilian predators. You show your
fangs and scales proudly. Your people survive and thrive in the
wetlands, guarding their eggs, raising their hatchlings, and protecting
their territory. City-builders may call you a savage and your culture
primitive, but there is grace in your hunting, artistry in your
crafting, joy in your songs, and reverence in your worship. 

You gain the following characteristics: 

Agile: +2 to your Speed Pool. 

Skill: You are trained in balancing, jumping, and swimming. 

Skill: You are trained in hunting and tracking. 

Skill: You are practiced in using javelins and spears. 

Scaly: +1 to Armor. 

Inability: Your slightly clawed hands make fine detail work difficult.
You have an inability with picking locks, picking pockets, and other
manual dexterity tasks (but not crafting).

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure. 

1\. The other PCs were lost in your territory and you were sent to

worthiness before you can return to it. 

4\. You or your priest had a vision of you traveling with the other PCs.

OPTIONAL RULE: SPELLCASTING

Fantasy settings prioritize magic as an essential ingredient. But why
restrict that magic to just wizards and similar characters? It’s not
uncommon in fantasy literature for a thief or warrior to learn a few
spells as they steal or brawl through their adventures. Leiber’s Gray
Mouser knew some spells, Moorcock’s Elric knew a lot, pretty much
everyone in Anthony’s Xanth books knew at least one, and so on. Of
course, wizards and sorcerers specialize in spellcasting, which gives
them clear superiority in magic use. But whether a character is a
fireball-flinging wizard or a belligerent barbarian, anyone can learn
some spellcasting under this optional rule.

Under the spellcasting rule, any character, no matter their role or
type, can choose to learn a spell as a long-term benefit. After they
learn one spell, they may learn more later if they wish, or just stick
with the one.

FIRST SPELL

Any character can gain a spell by spending 3 XP and working with the GM
to come up with an in-game story of how the PC learned it. Maybe they
learned it as a child from their parent and practiced it enough to
actually do it; perhaps they spent a month hiding in a wizard’s library
reading; it could be that they found a weird magical amulet that imbues
them with the spell; and so on.

Next, choose one low-tier ability from the Abilities chapter. If the GM
agrees it is appropriate, the character gains that ability as their
spell, with a few caveats. The spell can’t be used like a normal ability
gained through a PC’s type or focus. Instead, a character must either
use a recovery roll or spend many minutes or longer evoking their spell,
in addition to paying its Pool cost (if any).

Using a Recovery Roll to Cast a Spell: If the character uses a
one-action, ten-minute, or one-hour recovery roll as part of the same
action to cast the spell (including paying any Pool costs), they can use
the ability as an action. This represents a significant mental and
physical drain on the character, because the normal benefit of
recovering points in a Pool is not gained.

Spending Time to Cast a Spell: If the character takes at least ten
minutes chanting, mumbling occult phonemes, concentrating deeply, or
otherwise using all their actions, they can cast a low-tier spell (if
they also pay any Pool costs). An hour is required to cast mid-tier
spells. Ten hours are required to cast a high-tier spell.

MORE SPELLS

Once a character has learned at least one spell, they can opt to learn
additional spells later. Each time, they must spend an additional 3 XP
and work with the GM to come up with an in-game story of how the
character’s magical learning has progressed.

Two additional rules for learning additional spells apply:

First, a character must be at least tier 3 and have previously gained
one low-tier spell before they can learn a mid-tier spell.

Second, a character must be at least tier 5 and have previously gained
one mid-tier spell before they can learn a high-tier spell.

Otherwise, gaining and casting additional spells are as described for
the character’s first spell.

WIZARDS AND THE OPTIONAL SPELLCASTING RULE

Wizards (usually Adepts) and characters with explicit spellcasting foci
like Masters Spells, Channels Divine Blessings, Speaks for the Land, and
possibly others are also considered to be spellcasters, and moreover,
specialized ones. Their spells—abilities provided by their type or
focus—are used simply by paying their Pool costs. Extra time or physical
effort isn’t required to cast them. That’s because, in the parlance of
the fantasy genre, these spells are considered to be “prepared.”

But specialized casters can also use the optional spellcasting rule to
expand their magic further. They can learn additional spells via the
optional spellcasting rule just like other characters, with the same
limitations.

Optionally, specialized casters who record their arcane knowledge in a
spellbook (or something similar) gain one additional benefit. The
spellbook is a compilation of spells, formulas, and notes that grants
the specialized caster more flexibility than those who’ve simply learned
a spell or two. With a spellbook, a PC can replace up to three prepared
spells with three other spells they’ve learned of the same tier. To do
so, they must spend at least one uninterrupted hour studying their
spellbook. Usually, this is something that requires a fresh mind, and
must be done soon after a ten-hour recovery.

For instance, if a wizard exchanges Ward (an ability gained from their
type) with Telekinesis (an ability gained from the optional spellcasting
rule), from now on the character can cast Ward only by spending time or
using a recovery roll (as well as spending Pool points). On the other
hand, they can use Telekinesis normally, because now it’s prepared.
Later, the wizard could spend the time studying to change out their
prepared spells with others they’ve learned using the optional
spellcasting rule.

(A PC might choose the 4 XP character advancement option to select a new
type-based ability from their tier or a lower tier. If so, the ability
gained doesn’t count as a spell, and the spellcasting rule limitations
do not apply to the ability so gained. If the PC is a wizard and uses
the 4 XP character advancement option, treat the ability as one more
prepared spell.)

MODERN RULES MODULE

The modern setting is easy because it’s just the real world, right?
Well, yes and no. It’s easy for players to understand the context of a
modern setting. They know the default assumptions—cities, cars, cell
phones, the internet, and so on. It’s also easier for some players to
get into character, because their character could be someone they might
very well pass on the street. It can be easier to wrap your mind around
a history professor than a thousand-year-old elf wizard. These things
make it easier on the GM as well.

But for the same reason, it’s not easy. The setting is the real world we
all know, so it’s easy to get facts wrong or let them bog you down. What
happens when you pull the fire alarm on the thirty-fifth floor of a
major hotel in a large city? How fast do the authorities arrive? In
truth, the facts aren’t as important as the story you’re creating, but
some verisimilitude is nice.

MOLDING CHARACTERS FOR A MODERN GAME

If you’re trying to portray a psychic with a few basic powers, you might
not want to use the Adept character type. Instead, choose a different
type (perhaps a Speaker) and encourage foci such as Commands Mental
Powers or Focuses Mind Over Matter. Some of the Adept’s powers might be
too over the top for the genre.

Similarly, the technology flavor is probably too high-tech for a modern
game. For someone with technical skills, use the skills and knowledge
flavor instead.

Sometimes, the types might be more physical than is always desirable for
a modern game, but that’s because the least physical type, the Adept, is
often inappropriate for other reasons. The Calm descriptor is very good
for such characters, not only granting them a great deal of skill and
knowledge, but also reducing their physical capabilities.

Last, don’t forget foci such as Doesn’t Do Much or Would Rather Be
Reading for “normal” characters who have useful skills but not much in
the way of flashy abilities.

OPTIONAL RULE: HANDLING PCs AS CHILDREN

The regular character creation process makes fully competent, adult
characters. To account for playing children, the GM could adopt this
optional rule. First, the players make their characters normally, and
then they apply the following adjustments to their PCs, as appropriate
to their age category. You might also consider applying a tier cap of 3
to childhood adventure games with kids of up to thirteen years old, and
a tier cap of 4 for childhood adventure games featuring PCs who are aged
fourteen to seventeen.

AGE 9 TO 13

Slight: –4 to your Might Pool.

Vulnerable: Adults look out for you. You are trained in all pleasant
social interactions with adults.

Inability: Might-based tasks are hindered.

Inability: Tasks involving knowledge are hindered.

AGE 14 TO 17

Youthful: –2 to your Might Pool.

Inability: Tasks involving knowledge are hindered.

SCIENCE FICTION RULES MODULE

Science fiction is an incredibly broad category. It covers UFOs, space
opera, near-future dystopias, otherworldly epics, hard science fiction,
and everything in between. Even when compared to fantasy, science
fiction is so wide that it almost isn’t a single genre at all.
Truthfully, there’s not all that much to tie, say, *The Time Machine* by
H. G. Wells with a dark cyberpunk story except for the technology
involved, which is at a higher level than we possess or understand
today. But even that part of science fiction is contentious. Should the
science be purely that which obeys the laws of physics as we understand
them today (often called hard science fiction), or is it more of an
“anything goes” proposition? Is science we can’t explain really just
magic?

For our purposes, we’ll treat fantastic science fiction as the default:
aliens, spaceships that allow travel to other stars, energy weapons and
shields, and so on. It’s a familiar setting to almost everyone
interested in science fiction. That said, we’ve also got some additional
guidance for hard science fiction, where what’s possible is more
grounded in what we currently scientifically extrapolate. But your
science fiction setting can be anything you can imagine.

ASSEMBLING A SCI-FI SETTING

ESTABLISHING A TECHNOLOGY RATING

Every science fiction setting has an implicit level of advancement,
which is the average degree of technological sophistication available to
most characters. This sophistication lies along a spectrum, from
contemporary, to advanced, all the way to fantastic. Each of these terms
specifies a particular “technology rating” (or “tech rating” for
short). 

A tech rating is a handy way of helping you select what equipment your
characters can use, which optional rules you’d like to include, and
maybe even help guide your creature choice.

On the other hand, you could choose to make all options available,
regardless of tech rating. No technology police will cite you if you
don’t stick inside a previously declared lane. The setting is your
background for telling a compelling story. Does your setting have
faster-than-light travel? Great. Unless it’s integral to the story (or
fun for you), don’t worry about justifying it if you’ve generally
settled on an advanced rating for your hard science fiction game (which
doesn’t normally include FTL capability). In fact, the surprising and
unexpected are where excitement is usually found in a setting; breaking
the established rules (for a good reason) often leads to interesting
results.

COSMIC SET PIECES AND OPTIONAL RULES

This chapter contains a variety of subsystems and set pieces that you
can choose to incorporate in your game, depending on the kind of setting
you’d like to run. Options here run the gamut from making your science
fiction setting more realistic to making your fantastic games even
wilder by introducing rules for posthuman advancement and psionics.

QUICK DESCRIPTIONS FOR COMMON SCI-FI SITUATIONS

Weightlessness (zero G) feels like, first time: The sensation of falling
jerks through the body; instincts scream to reach out and catch
yourself. 

Weightlessness (zero G) feels like, once acclimated: A feeling of
lightness, evanescence, like floating in a pool of water, if the water
were clear air. A little push sends you gliding. 

High acceleration feels like (if strapped in): A massive kick in the
back, followed by the sensation of tremendous weights sitting on your
chest. Any movement is a struggle against an overwhelming weight holding
you down. 

Blacking out from high acceleration feels like: Lightheaded and hard to
think, a sensation of a slowing pulse. Noises soften as if heard through
a drainpipe. Color fades from vision, then everything goes either to
black, or possibly to white, as consciousness lapses. 

Exposure to hard radiation feels like: Heat. (The more dangerous the
radiation, the hotter it feels, and may be accompanied by blue light;
radiation excites electrons in the air that then slip back into an
unexcited state, emitting high-energy photons that glow blue.) 

Exposure to vacuum feels like: Breath explodes out of lungs, cold
slashes the body like a knife carved from a glacier. Tears freeze in the
corners of eyes, ice forms on teeth and tongue. Moisture boils out of
ears, scalp, freezing on exposed skin, lips, and eyelids. (As this
happens, the Effects of Vacuum also take their mechanical toll on the
character.)

OPTIONAL RULES: HARDER SCIENCE FICTION

Hard science fiction is distinguished from other science fiction
subgenres by the perception of scientific accuracy. This means hard
science fiction often precludes technology deemed impossible by
mainstream scientific theory, including mainstays like faster-than-light
travel and time travel. Choosing a hard science fiction setting also
means the GM is interested in sprinkling realistic hazards into their
game, at least up to a point. After all, the difficulties of real-life
space travel offer tremendous breadth when it comes to providing
excitement (i.e., life-threatening dangers) that can raise the stakes in
an authentic fashion. Not to say that gun battles with space aliens
aren’t exciting, but in a hard science fiction setting without aliens,
there are all kinds of opportunities for pulse-pounding GM intrusions. 

In fact, that bears repeating: Use GM intrusions to incorporate these
harder science fiction repercussions when the situation is relevant.
Rather than hitting your PCs over the head with an
information-exposition hammer on the dangers of space repeatedly, simply
demonstrate it with a relevant GM intrusion. 

The Cypher System Rulebook describes some hard science fiction
considerations regarding the effects of gravity, which are summarized
here for ease of reference.

Long-Term Microgravity Exposure: Long-term penalties (such as
inabilities in physical tasks), unless ameliorated with advanced drugs
such as space-fit serum or space-fit nano-tabs. 

Low Gravity: Weapons that rely on weight, such as all heavy weapons,
inflict 2 fewer points of damage (dealing a minimum of 1 point) unless
user is trained in low-gravity maneuvering. Short-range weapons can
reach to long range, and long-range weapons can reach to very long
range. 

High Gravity: All physical tasks are hindered. Ranges in high gravity
are reduced by one category (very long-range weapons reach only to long
range, long-range weapons reach only to short range, and short-range
weapons reach only to immediate range). Those trained in highgravity
maneuvering ignore the change in difficulty but not the range
decreases. 

Zero Gravity: All physical tasks are hindered. Short-range weapons can
reach to long range, and long-range weapons can reach to very-long
range.

VOID RULES

The extreme environment in space— hard radiation, lack of air and
pressure, wild temperature variations, and lack of gravity—tends to
magnify small issues into much more significant ones. While Murphy’s Law
(everything that can go wrong will go wrong) is a useful reminder to
keep an eye out for trouble even under regular circumstances, Finagle’s
Law reigns in space, which is that anything that can go wrong, will go
wrong—at the worst possible moment. To evoke this law, GMs can implement
Void Rules. 

The idea is to create a feeling of increased repercussions by changing
one die roll mechanic. In the game, activities on a planet’s surface—and
within a functioning air-filled spacecraft, habitat, or space suit when
everything is going well—remain normal. The PCs interact with each other
and the NPCs, investigate, research, repair an external sensor module,
travel, and so on. 

But that could change the moment something goes wrong—maybe a fault is
recognized in the spacecraft’s computer or shipmind. A minor leak is
detected in the cargo bay. An enemy spacecraft has fired on and damaged
the PC’s spacecraft. The spacecraft’s orbit is deteriorating. Whatever.
The point is, the situation has suddenly become complicated. In space,
when a situation becomes complicated, it also becomes potentially
deadly. That’s when you have the option to announce you’ve instituted
Void Rules. 

While using Void Rules, GM intrusions governed by die rolls change.
Normally this happens only on a roll of 1, but when Void Rules apply, it
becomes a roll of 1 or a 2. Void Rules are similar in many ways to
Horror Mode, though the threat range doesn’t normally continue to
escalate. 

While Void Rules are in effect, the GM intrusions automatically
triggered should play off the situation, influenced as much as possible
by the realistic dangers space travel has on the human body and the
situation at hand

Choosing Instead of Rolling: Each GM intrusion is keyed to a die result,
usually a d6. The die range is not meant to imply you should always
randomly generate a GM intrusion. Instead of rolling, choose the
conflict that you think will make the story better and more exciting.
The option to roll is really only here if you can’t decide (and are
facing decision fatigue). Mainly, these GM intrusion tables are provided
as a quick way to inspire complications for a given situation. 

EFFECTS OF VACUUM

In terms of game mechanics, an unprotected character in vacuum moves one
step down the damage track each round. However, at the point where they
should die, they instead fall unconscious and remain so for about a
minute. If they are rescued during that time, they can be revived. If
not, they die

| 01  | The character notices a crack in their space suit or ship. It’s not breached now, but may soon become a serious problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 02  | A breach in another part of the ship or space station causes automatic safety pressure baffles to close that section off. A character might be caught in that area of the ship, or in an area of a descending baffle, which inflicts serious damage on the character (these things are made to resist obstructions and form a seal). |
| 03  | A previously unknown crack in a space suit or ship begins to leak. It doesn’t cause a blow-out, but unless the crack can be repaired or sealed, those affected will eventually be exposed to vacuum.                                                                                                                                 |
| 04  | A catastrophic blow-out exposes the character or characters to vacuum. It may also send them spiraling out into the void, depending on the situation.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 05  | Vacuum exposure causes the character to projectile vomit, effectively rendering them unable to take an action on their next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 06  | Vacuum exposure causes the character to go temporarily blind, which is only relieved a few minutes after normal atmosphere is restored.                                                                                                                                                                                              |

SPACE SUITS ARE FALLIBLE

Even if advanced tech or fantastic tech is available, space suits are
susceptible to all kinds of mishaps. Of course, that’s especially true
for contemporary tech space suits, which work hard at keeping a constant
internal air volume so that a wearer doesn’t have to continually exert
themselves to hold the suit in a given position or pre-breathe oxygen at
a higher concentration. “Hard-shell” suits manage this with multiple
joints and segments that shift on ball bearings, and by being able to
maintain a higher internal pressure than soft suits.

| 02  | Mechanical joints in the suit freeze unexpectedly, hindering all the character’s actions (or completely paralyzing the character) until repairs can be made.                                                                                                                                         |
| 03  | A stuck valve causes the drinking water bulb to get stuck “on” and water begins filling the helmet. This could blind and/or drown the character if not dealt with                                                                                                                                    |
| 04  | Space sickness/a tumble/a spin nauseates the character. If they vomit in their helmet, they are blinded until such time as the helmet can be removed and cleaned.                                                                                                                                    |
| 05  | An electrical short from an external tool or piece of hardware fries the space suit’s electronics, limiting communication to helmet-tohelmet touch (if in a vacuum where sound doesn’t propagate), use of micro thrusters, and limits air supply to just a quarter of what was previously available. |
| 06  | A bloated suit from an overpressure incident hinders all tasks, but is not lethal . . . until the suit won’t quite fit back into the airlock.                                                                                                                                                        |

EFFECTS OF ACCELERATION AND HIGH-G MANEUVERS

In a fantastic tech setting where gravitic control usually cancels
inertia, spacecraft acceleration (or deceleration) is only an issue when
the gravitic systems malfunction. But acceleration is always something
everyone has to deal with in contemporary or advanced tech settings.

Of course, massive acceleration (or deceleration) is just plain lethal.
Someone who jumps off a ten-story building is subject to several hundred
Gs when they suddenly stop. Less extreme is still dangerous, because it
pulls blood out of pilots’ and passengers’ heads, rendering them
unconscious. This can happen at just 4 or 5 Gs without any amelioration,
though contemporary tech allows fighter craft pilots to withstand up to
9 Gs for limited periods. Advanced tech methods, which include
acceleration serum, allow characters to survive the kind of Gs a
spacecraft might pull for extended trips or during battle, up to a
maximum of 15 Gs. Ships have limiters that normally prevent them from
thrusting at higher speeds. Normally.

|-----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01  | After high-G maneuvers, even with amelioration, tissue bruising results, giving the character black eyes, which take a few days to clear.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 02  | While under high Gs, a tool or piece of equipment comes loose, accelerates through the craft, and strikes the character, inflicting damage.

| 04  | While under high Gs (or afterward), a mild brain aneurysm causes the character to have a sudden headache and blurred vision, which hinders all vision-related tasks until medical treatment is received.                                                                                                             |
| 05  | While under high Gs (or afterward), the character begins to have a hard time breathing. The reason is that a lung or lungs have partially collapsed.

LONG-TERM EXPOSURE TO ZERO G AND RADIATION

In a setting with contemporary tech, a variety of issues related to
long-term exposure to micro-gravity and high radiation beset astronauts,
including bone and muscle loss, less circulating blood and red cell
mass, less ability to constrict and dilate in vessels, irregular
hormones, diminished immune system, inability of mitochondria to
initiate wound healing, and even shortened telomeres. The inability to
heal even minor wounds and nicks until a space-farer returns to stronger
gravity will eventually prove lethal, though a snapped bone or normally
inconsequential virus or parasite could also do them in.

| 05  | Despite precautions, sometimes viruses infect a character.

MOVING IN MICROGRAVITY 

Long-term zero G is dangerous, but there are issues associated with
moving around in microgravity. Those who have spent at least a little
time in microgravity can move as part of a routine action. It’s only
when something else distracting or dangerous is happening simultaneously
that routine movements through a ship or station become potentially
problematic.

OPTIONAL RULES: EXTENDED VEHICULAR COMBAT (SPACECRAFT COMBAT)

When vehicular combat occurs—which happens whenever the PCs are
completely enclosed in a vehicle so that it’s not really the characters
fighting, but the vehicles— start with the vehicular combat rules
described in the Cypher System Rulebook. 

However, if you’d like to provide the PCs with more options designed
especially for spacecraft combat, use these optional rules instead,
which include a “redline maneuver” system for trying extremely risky
spacecraft maneuvers, bridge combat options, and more. The base
vehicular combat rules have been integrated into these extended rules,
so you don’t need to continually cross-reference them to understand how
it all works.

In extended vehicular combat, PCs on a spacecraft take actions on their
turn, just like in a standard Cypher System combat encounter. Use
standard initiative rules to determine when PCs take their actions, and
when enemy spacecraft take theirs. Characters will be crewing specific
spacecraft system stations described under Bridge Combat, and thus could
attempt a piloting maneuver, to fire the ship weapons, to scan the enemy
craft for weaknesses, or to attempt some similar spacecraft operation
task on their turn. Alternatively, they might be somewhere else on the
ship attempting repairs, fighting off boarders, attempting to open
communications in order to negotiate, or taking some other action. 

For their part, enemy spacecraft are likely to fire on the same systems
aboard a PCs’ spacecraft as the ones the PCs are firing on (weapons,
defenses, engines, or even a kill shot). The PC pilot rolls one or more
defense rolls. The enemy spacecraft faces the same modifications the PCs
face when targeting a particular system (as described hereafter), except
those modifications ease or hinder the PC making the defense roll, since
NPC craft never roll themselves. And, if an enemy ship manages to
disable a system on the PCs’ ship on an attack, PCs can attempt repair
tasks to get those systems back online on their turns. 

The main difference between spacecraft combat and regular combat is that
the difficulty of tasks that the PCs attempt in relation to the enemy
craft varies a lot more than in regular combat. In normal combat, a task
difficulty is usually equal to the foe’s level. But in spacecraft
combat, a task difficulty is equal to a modified task difficulty
(beginning with the spacecraft’s level, but moving on from there, as
noted hereafter). The modified difficulty always applies to anything
characters attempt in regard to the enemy spacecraft, whether a PC fires
at an enemy ship, dodges return fire, attempts to scan the enemy
spacecraft, attempts to repair damage caused by the enemy spacecraft,
and so on.

It’s actually similar to a normal task. For example, when a PC scans a
robot, the task difficulty is usually the robot’s level, but not always.
Sometimes the robot’s effective level is modified because of intrinsic
skills or systems the robot possesses, or because of something it does
making it harder (or easier) for it to be scanned. In the case of
spacecraft combat, modification is pretty much a given, and is even more
variable. So variable, in fact, that a space combat status tracker has
been provided. to turn potentially confusing conflicts into something as
easy as looking at a marker to know what the difficulty for a particular
task is.

The modifiers that apply, even before PCs attempt a specific combat task
noted under Bridge Combat, are as follows.

BASE COMBAT TASK MODIFIERS

The following modifiers change the effective level of the enemy of the
spacecraft for a given task by hindering or easing a PC’s roll. Track
each change in effective level on the space combat status tracker

SPACECRAFT LEVEL DIFFERENCE

Compare the levels of the spacecraft involved in the conflict. If the
PCs’ vehicle has the higher level, the difference in levels becomes a
reduction in the difficulty of attack and defense rolls PCs might make.
If the PCs’ vehicle has the lower level, the difference is an increase
in difficulty by the same amount. If the levels are the same, there is
no modification. 

MISMATCHED TECH RATING

It’s possible that vehicles from different tech ratings will fight each
other at some point, or become caught up in a larger multi-vehicle
fight. When they do, each step difference in tech rating between two
opposed vehicles increases the effective level of the higher-rated
vehicle by two steps.

VEHICLE COORDINATION  
If two vehicles coordinate their attack against an enemy vehicle, the
attack is eased. If three or more vehicles coordinate, the attack is
eased by two steps. 

SUPERIOR SHIP SYSTEMS

Some vehicles have superior weapons or defenses, as noted in the
specific vehicle listing in chapter 8. If a vehicle has a superior
system, treat that vehicle as if one level higher than its actual level
when figuring attacks or evasion tasks if that specific system is
involved.

REDLINE MANEUVER

When someone with access to spacecraft controls attempts a particularly
audacious and risky maneuver, it’s a “redline” maneuver. Essentially,
declaring a redline maneuver eases one task a PC attempts in a
spacecraft under duress, but comes with a concomitant risk. 

To make a redline maneuver, a character spends 1 XP as a free action. In
doing so, they unlock the option for all the PCs to attempt to redline
for rest of the combat. To redline, a PC describes the dangerous thing
they want to attempt, then takes that action. Mechanically, the PC eases
the particular task they are attempting (which might just be to fire at
the enemy craft’s weapons), but increases the GM intrusion range by two
points. 

A character who redlines could opt to increase their gamble by easing a
task by two steps or even more; however, each step increases the GM
intrusion range by another two points that round. 

Redline maneuvers are also available in desperate non-combat situations
aboard a spacecraft. For example, Tammie’s ship is caught in a decaying
orbit over Venus, and the ship doesn’t have enough power left to break
out. She tells the GM that she’s going to try an extremely risky
maneuver that involves igniting ALL the remaining power at once, hoping
that the explosive thrust will succeed in blowing the craft into a
higher orbit. Because things are desperate, she commits to easing the
task by two steps after paying 1 XP. This easing (plus any skill,
application of Effort, and so on) gives her a pretty decent chance of
succeeding, except the GM intrusion range is now 1–5. 

If a GM intrusion is triggered, something goes wrong. Remember that
success might still be possible if the roll was high enough, but still
falls within the increased GM intrusion range.

If you’re looking for inspiration for appropriate GM intrusions when a
redlining PC triggers one, refer to suggested GM intrusions presented
under Bridge Combat hereafter, each associated with a particular ship
system that a character is probably crewing. 

After any round where a redline maneuver was attempted, the GM intrusion
range returns to normal (1 on a 1d20) as the next round beings. 

Multiple Redline Maneuvers: Only one PC needs to spend 1 XP to unlock
redline maneuvers for themselves and for any other PCs aboard the same
spacecraft for the duration of a single encounter. Multiple redline
attempts during the same round by two or more PCs additively increase
the GM intrusion range for that round. So, a PC attempting to redline
who takes their turn after previous redline attempts that round faces a
GM intrusion range that’s already inflated, and which will inflate more
when they redline. (PCs who do not redline during a particular round
don’t have to worry about the increasing GM intrusion range for their
action.)

Thus, while PCs do not need to pre-announce their intention to redline
at the beginning of each round, coordinating wouldn’t be a bad idea.
Whichever PC redlines last in a round where redline maneuvers were
already attempted could face a fairly significant GM intrusion range. 

If Void Rules are also being used and have triggered, redline maneuvers
are even more dangerous.

THE SUPERIORITY OF A WELL-CREWED SPACECRAFT

A spacecraft with some or all of the PCs crewing different systems
stations will be more capable than a regular spacecraft in combat. Which
means that an enemy spacecraft that might prove challenging based on its
level might actually be fairly easily handled by PCs who fully
understand their options. 

But be careful, because even competent PCs should fear squadrons of
enemy ships, and military craft with several weapon systems. Even a
single level difference is magnified, so make sure not to capriciously
throw spacecraft at the PCs that are 2 levels higher than their own

BRIDGE COMBAT

If several PCs are aboard the same spacecraft, give them the following
option: ask each PC to crew one of the ship system stations, including
weapons (of which there could be more than one system, requiring more
than one PC to crew them all), piloting, and science and engineering
(which could be divided into two stations with similar functionality). A
spacecraft generally has a number of system stations equal to its level.
PCs on spacecraft that are lower level must flip between system controls
as part of another action, using two stations or even just one station
for the whole ship. Even if a PC flips a station (reconfigures, as
engineers like to say), only a single PC can crew a station (and take an
action using it) each round.

When crewing their stations, PCs have several station-specific options
available to them. What they do can bears on how the encounter plays out
on a round-to-round basis, similar to regular combat. Specific options
are provided for each station, but characters are free to attempt other
actions they can think of.

The following ship systems might be found on larger spacecraft with room
for more than a single pilot.

Shipmind System Control: 

Some ships with integrated AIs (shipminds) can control a particular
system autonomously, without a PC. When it acts in this fashion, it can
only take a single action each round, which means it could attack and
move, but not also attempt a complicated engineering or defensive
maneuver. A shipmind acts at a level equal to the overall spacecraft. In
addition, shipmind actions against an enemy spacecraft are assessed with
the same modifiers for targeting as a PC crewing the station.

WEAPONS

A spacecraft may have more than one weapon system. Each individual
weapon system has its own station, which can be crewed by a separate PC.
Spacecraft systems are considered heavy weapons (which means some
characters may be practiced in their use, though others may have an
inability). A spacecraft can potentially make as many attacks each round
as weapon systems it possesses, if each station is crewed. 

Refer to PC Weapon System Options. If the PC triggers a GM intrusion,
the following table provides options to choose from.

PILOTING

Many spacecraft have only a single system and dedicated station for
piloting and navigation, suitable for a single PC to crew, though a
larger craft could split those duties. A PC piloting a ship during
combat can attempt any number of piloting tasks, as well as any other
type of flying that they deem necessary. While not in combat, the PC
crewing this station pilots the ship from place to place in space. 

Refer to PC Piloting System Options. If the PC triggers a GM intrusion,
the following table provides options to choose from.

A successful piloting defense task is not always a miss: A failed enemy
attack doesn’t always mean it misses a character’s craft. The PC’s
spacecraft might rock and reel from the hit, but the bulk of the damage
was absorbed by the hull or shields, so there’s no significant damage.

SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING

A spacecraft may have more than one science and engineering system. Each
science and engineering system has a station, each of which can be
crewed by a separate PC. A spacecraft can potentially attempt as many
science and engineering tasks each round as stations systems it
possesses, if each one is crewed. 

Refer to PC Science & Engineering System Options. If the PC triggers a
GM intrusion, the following table provides options to choose from.

| 06  | Hull integrity breached, atmosphere begins to vent, and possibly one or two crew too near the hole are at risk of being sucked out. Unless repaired, ship atmosphere is lost to space within a few minutes.  |

OPTIONAL: COMMAND

Ships with a captain may have a Command station, possibly a captain’s
chair, though the captain might just crew one of the other stations.
Sometimes those with captain’s privileges also have the Captain’s Calm
special ability. Normally, a captain commanding someone else to do
something can’t redline; it would be up to the person who received the
command whether to try to redline or not, and to face any GM intrusion
consequences.

BRIDGE COMBAT AT THE TABLE

Running a combat using these extended rules is straightforward. 

Know your stuff: First, familiarize yourself with the material. 

Assign characters a station: Next, if you have some time to prepare,
copy the two-page spread containing the various PC system options, and
give one to each player. Tell them to figure out what stations they are
crewing, based on the number of systems their ship has (usually no more
systems than the level of the ship). You will probably also have to
explain the basics.

Deploy space combat status tracker: Also make a copy of the one-page
space combat status tracker and set it on the table so everyone can see.
It’ll make a huge difference in how your space combat plays out. The
status tracker allows you (and the players) to easily mark the
difficulty of current space combat task a PC is attempting, without
having to hold all the easing and hindering in your heads, or having to
write them out each time. 

Space Combat Status Tracker Instructions: Using dice (or similar
objects) as markers, track the difficulty of the current task that a PC
is attempting, as well as the GM intrusion range for that round if any
character is attempting to redline. Place the marker in the column
appropriate to the kind of task being attempted (attack, defense, or
other) at the starting difficulty level. If the PCs face more than one
enemy spacecraft, use different colored dice to represent different
ships, or separate copies of this status tracker for each additional
enemy spacecraft. 

At the end of each full round, reset all the markers on the tracker to
their base state, unless some effect causes a modification that lasts
longer than a round. Be sure to reset the GM intrusion marker, too.

Roll initiative: Begin the combat, with the enemy spacecraft of your
choice taking on the PCs’ ship. Decide whether the enemy spacecraft are
already in weapon range (it’s your call, we’re not tracking that here),
and if not, how soon they will be close enough to begin attacking, and
let the combat flow

VEHICLES FIGHTING CREATURES

Spacecraft vs. Colossal Creatures: If a creature is as capable as a
spacecraft, treat it that way when it comes to vehicular combat. Instead
of adjusting for mismatched tech rating, treat the creature’s effective
level as if three levels less than its actual level. Extrapolate “weapon
systems” to the creature’s attack methods, defenses to its weird organic
plating, and so on. Killing such a creature means taking out its “power
core or other vital spot.”

Spacecraft vs. Regular Creatures: If a vehicle weapon system fires on an
unprotected PC (or a PC in a spacecraft fires ship weapons on a creature
outside the craft that isn’t colossal), it’s an entirely different
situation. Attacks against a vehicle’s systems face all the previously
mentioned modifiers. On top of that, add an additional five steps of
hindrance to attacks by a regular creature against a starcraft.

A PC defending from a spacecraft’s attack is hindered by five steps.
Except in this case, the spacecraft inflicts damage. Given that ship
weapons compared to handheld weapons are an order of magnitude apart
when it comes to power, a good rule of thumb is that a spacecraft’s
weapon inflicts 25 points of damage on a successful hit and knocks the
character one step down the damage track. Even if the character succeeds
on their defense roll, they still take 5 points of damage.

PC WEAPON SYSTEM OPTIONS

All tasks are also modified by any relevant PC skills (or inabilities)
and Effort, as usual.

| Coordinate fire                  | –           | If PC’s ship has second weapon system, coordinate fire with it, providing that system an asset this round. (This weapon doesn’t make a separate attack) |
| Redline attack                   | –           | Overcharge weapons, ricochet shot, or some other risky gamble                                                                                           |

PC PILOTING SYSTEM OPTIONS  

All tasks are also modified by any relevant PC skills (or inabilities)
and Effort, as usual. 

| Piloting Task       | Hindrance   | Effect on Target Craft                                                                                                                                               |
|---------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Evasive maneuvers   | One step    | Defenses eased three steps, but attacks this round hindered by the same amount                                                                                       |
| Increase separation | One step    | Defenses eased one step, attacks hindered by one step, but creates chance to lose enemy aircraft (see below)                                                         |
| Decrease separation | –           | Negates chance of losing enemy craft this round                                                                                                                      |
| Stealth approach    | Three steps | So long as no attack is made, pilot’s craft can ‘snug’ up to much larger enemy craft and hide from its sensors                                                       |
| Lose enemy craft    | Four steps  | If separation is first increased as a separate task (or maneuverability is disabled), target craft loses track of pilot’s craft behind a moon, in a debris belt, etc |
| Study enemy flying  | –           | Spend one round watching enemy tactics, the next piloting task is eased                                                                                              |
| Fly in formation    | –           | If another allied ship is part of the combat, coordinate with it, providing that ship an asset in its next piloting task                                             |
| Redline maneuver    | –           | Spinning, flying through a dangerous region, or some other gamble                                                                                                    |

PC SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING SYSTEM OPTIONS  

All tasks are also modified by any relevant PC skills (or inabilities)
and Effort, as usual. 

| Science and Engineering Task | Hindrance | Effect on Target Craft (or on PC’s craft)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Tactical scane               | One step  | Learn the level of identified enemy spacecraft                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Deep scan                    | Two steps | Enemy spacecraft weakness discovered, next task chosen by this character for another PC is eased (usually a piloting or weapons task)                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Jam/Hack                     | Two steps | Requires three success before two failures (thus a minimum of three rounds); if successful, enemy ship takes no actions for a couple of rounds until they regain control by severing the communications link; during this time, all tasks against enemy craft are eased by two steps                                          |
| Open communications          | Two steps | Attempt to parlay; at the very least, success causes the enemy spacecraft to delay at least one round, which could be the end of it, or open further dialouge                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Reconfigure station          | –         | Changes the system that the station controls. Useful when another station is damaged or the PC crewing another station is disabled; reconfiguration locks out options from whatever system is previously controlled unless reconfigured again; can be done as part of another action                                          |
| Effect repair                | –         | Sometimes a character can repair a subsystem from their station, but repair may require moving to another part of the ship, such as the drive chamber, the compartment where weapons are sleeved, or even onto the outer hull. The difficulty is equal to the modified difficulty of the enemy craft that caused the damage.  |
| Redline science/engineering  | –         | Reverse polarity on the sensors, dig up some bizarre lore from a database that could change the situation somehow, make the hull reflective, or some other risky gambit                                                                                                                                                       |

OPTIONAL RULE: PSIONICS

Through sheer force of will, a psionic character can unleash inborn
mental abilities such as telepathy, precognition, and telekinesis. As a
GM, your first decision must be whether you want to incorporate psionics
into your setting.

If you do not want to allow psionics into your game, then restrict foci
like Commands Mental Powers, Focuses Mind Over Matter, and Separates
Mind From Body. And of course, restrict the suggested types of Psion and
Psychic Knight described in the Cypher System Rulebook.

LATENT PSIONICS

Under the latent psionics rule, any character, no matter their role or
type, can unlock a psionic ability (either purposefully, or
accidentally), as a long-term benefit (see “first psi ability”
hereafter). After they unlock one psionic ability, they may unlock more
later if they wish (or if their ability seeks to reveal itself), or just
try to stick with the one.

FIRST PSI ABILITY 

Any character can unlock a psionic ability by spending 3 XP and working
with the GM to come up with an in-game story of how the character
unlocked it. 

Next, choose one low-tier ability from Chapter 9: Abilities in the
Cypher System Rulebook. If the GM agrees it is appropriate, the
character gains that ability as their psionic ability, with a few
caveats. The ability can’t be used like a normal ability gained through
a PC’s type or focus. Instead, a character must either expend a recovery
roll or spend many minutes or longer evoking the psionic ability before
it takes effect, in addition to paying its Pool cost (if any).

Expending a Recovery Roll to Manifest a Psionic Ability: If the
character expends a one-action, ten-minute, or one-hour recovery roll as
part of the same action to manifest a psionic ability (including paying
any Pool costs), they can use the ability as an action.

Expending Time to Manifest a Psionic Ability: If the character takes at
least ten minutes meditating, concentrating deeply, or otherwise using
all their actions, they can manifest a low-tier psionic ability (if they
also pay any Pool costs). An hour is required to manifest mid-tier
abilities. Ten hours are required to manifest a high-tier ability.

MORE PSI ABILITIES 

Once a character has unlocked at least one psionic ability, they can opt
to unlock additional abilities later. Each time, they must spend an
additional 3 XP and work with the GM to come up with an in-game story of
how the character’s mental development has progressed. 

Two additional rules for learning additional psionic abilities apply:
First, a character must be at least tier 3 and have previously unlocked
one low-tier psionic ability before they can learn a mid-tier psionic
ability. Second, a character must be at least tier 5 and have previously
unlocked one mid-tier psionic ability before they can unlock a high-tier
ability.

PSIONS AND THE OPTIONAL LATENT PSIONICS RULE

Characters with explicitly psionic foci like Commands Mental Powers,
Focuses Mind over Matter, Separates Mind from Body, and possibly
others—as well types like Psion and Psychic Knight—are also considered
to be psionic characters, and moreover, specialized ones. Their psionic
abilities— provided by their type or focus—are used simply by paying
their Pool costs. Extra time or physical effort isn’t required to
manifest them. That’s because they’ve trained to use those abilities,
rather than having stumbled upon them accidentally like a latent
character. 

Specialized characters can use the optional latency rule to further
expand their psionic potential, unlocking it just like other characters,
with the same limitations.

Optionally, specialized characters who have a psionic type and/or focus
gain one additional benefit if they also opt for latent abilities. Given
that they are already adept at unlocking abilities and using them as
quickly and easily as another character might shoot a laser pistol,
they’ve got some flexibility. Such a PC can replace up to three
abilities granted by their type and/or focus with three other psionic
abilities they’ve unlocked as a latent ability of the same tier. To do
so, they must spend at least one uninterrupted hour in meditation.
Usually, this is something that requires a fresh mind, and must be done
soon after a ten-hour recovery. 

MORE POWERFUL PSIONICS

As the GM, you could allow a PC to spend 4 XP to unlock a new psionic
ability instead of 3 XP. Such an ability is treated more like a regular
type or focus ability. Such an ability is still governed by the rules
described under More Psi Abilities, but is not subject to the
limitations for manifesting the ability (i.e., expending a recovery roll
or lots of time); instead, the user simply pays their Pool costs to use
them. 

OPTIONAL RULE: POSTHUMAN UPGRADES

Posthuman upgrades are either available to everyone as the setting
begins or opened up later during the campaign as a significant plot
development. Note that many focus and type abilities might be considered
to have come from the kind up bodily upgrades normally associated with
posthuman transformation, especially high-tier abilities. Which is one
way to go. On the other hand, you could provide actual upgrades, such as
presented here, which actually increase the base power level of
characters. 

INTRODUCING UPGRADES TO YOUR SETTING

You have a few options for adding posthuman upgrades to your setting.
Characters might gain an initial upgrade for “free,” mechanically
speaking. After that, you might decide that that’s enough and they’re
done. 

Or, you could allow further upgrades, each requiring them to expend 4 XP
and serving as an Other Option requirement for advancing their
character. In this case, consider expanding the number of steps required
for advancing a tier from four to five. (Obtaining additional posthuman
upgrades reflects characters accessing latent abilities already present
inside them, or going back to whatever source granted the upgrades in
the first place, if that’s something you want to allow.)

Immediate Posthuman Upgrades: As part of character creation, PCs are
given the options presented hereafter because the setting demands it.
Narrative options include (but are not limited to):

 • PCs are part of a program designed to adapt them to being able to
survive and thrive in conditions other than the 1 G, 1 atmosphere,
oxygenated, Goldilocks environment of the Earth.

• PCs begin their career as super-soldiers to fight aliens or to serve
as corporate spies.

 • PCs serve as long-lived guardians to watch over a generation ship
hurtling at slower-than-light speeds between the stars. 

• PCs are children of a far-future civilization that routinely upgrades
its citizens. 

Delayed Posthuman Upgrades: Sometime after the players have a few
sessions under their belt, present the options hereafter to the PCs
because of a dramatic update to the plot. If one PC gains the option to
upgrade, then all the PCs should have that same advantage. Narrative
options include (but are not limited to): 

• PCs, exploring a cache of ancient ultra or other fantastic tech, find
a device that provides unexpected upgrades in the process of healing
them from other injuries. 

• PCs are kidnapped by aliens or conglomerate operatives, and
upgraded—with some command-andcontrol circuits also installed—to serve
some specific purpose.

 • PCs learn a “new science,” allowing them to tap cosmic energies other
creatures are unaware of.

POSTHUMAN PACKAGES

Posthuman “packages” that PCs might enjoy include the following. You
should decide which are available, and which ones your PCs gain. 

Spaceborn: You are not adversely affected by long-term microgravity or
high-radiation conditions common in space. In addition, you can
withstand high acceleration (up to 15 G) for about an hour without
passing out, having a stroke, a heart attack, and so on (though longer
periods of acceleration could still result in such outcomes). Add +1 to
your Intellect Edge. Enabler. (PCs without the spaceborn posthuman
upgrade probably have to rely on supplementation with adjuvants if they
travel in space, such as space-fit serum)

Jupiterborn: You can withstand high-gravity planets and high
acceleration (up to 15 G) indefinitely. For periods of up to an hour,
you can withstand double that. Add +1 to your Might Edge. Enabler. 

Seaborn: You can breathe underwater in pressures of up to 100
atmospheres indefinitely, up to triple that for about an hour. You have
an asset to all tasks performed in water. Add +1 to your Speed Edge.
Enabler. 

Expanded Consciousness: Only one of your brain hemispheres sleeps at a
time, so you are always awake and aware. In addition, you have a
magnetoreception sixth sense that allows you to “see” into objects and
through doors up to a short distance. Your initiative and perception
tasks are eased. You can forge a connection with electronic equipment
you touch, allowing you to attempt to communicate, analyze, or even hack
the device. Enabler. 

Synthetic Body: You have left biology behind and uploaded yourself into
a biomechanical form known as a synth. You enjoy the benefits of the
spaceborn package and expanded consciousness package, and one posthuman
power shift. Enabler.

POSTHUMAN POWER SHIFTS

A character may also gain posthuman abilities by way of power shifts, as
described in the Cypher System Rulebook. 

Under this rule, posthuman characters begin with two power shifts. They
can “unlock” one more each time they expend 4 XP toward advancing their
character. Power shifts are like permanent levels of Effort that are
always active. They don’t count toward a character’s maximum Effort use
(nor do they count as skills or assets). They simply ease tasks that
fall into specific categories, which include (but are not necessarily
limited to): 

Accuracy: All attack rolls 

Dexterity: Movement, acrobatics, initiative, and Speed defense 

Healing: One extra recovery roll per shift (each one action, all coming
before other normal recovery rolls) 

Intelligence: Intellect defense rolls and all knowledge, science, and
crafting tasks 

Power: Use of a specific power, including damage (3 additional points
per shift) but not attack rolls 

Resilience: Might defense rolls and Armor (+1 per shift) 

Single Attack: Attack rolls and damage (3 additional points per shift) 

Strength: All tasks involving strength, including jumping and dealing
damage in melee or thrown attacks (3 additional points of damage per
shift) but not attack rolls 

Each shift eases the task (except for shifts that affect damage or
Armor, as specified in the list above). Applying two shifts eases the
task by two steps, and applying three shifts eases the task by three
steps. A character assigns their five power shifts as desired, but most
characters should not be allowed to assign more than three to any one
category. Once the shifts are assigned, they should not change.

SALVAGE FROM A SPACECRAFT

If the derelict ship was subject to vacuum, partly destroyed in combat,
or damaged by some other disaster or close encounter with a space
hazard, salvaged items are usually degraded, and are valued at one price
category less than noted. The GM may decide an object is completely
unrecoverable (worthless) or works fine.

Salvage GM Intrusion: Claim jumpers/pirates might try to salvage a ship
that PCs are attempting to salvage.

FTL INSTABILITY

Even though many different kinds of faster-than-light options are
available, any use of FTL in a setting faces similar sorts of hazards at
three different points: when first entering FTL, while in FTL transit,
and when exiting FTL.

Entering FTL: Whether engaging warp drive or passing into the mouth of a
wormhole gate, complicating factors might require a piloting roll, with
the difficulty determined by the situation. On a failed roll, any number
of bad outcomes are possible, though the least dramatic is that the
craft simply fails to enter FTL and cannot do so until the PCs determine
the reason and rectify it.

In FTL Transit: A dark drive failure or some weird instability in a
wormhole throat, or some other issue during FTL transit could occur.
Usually, these instabilities are not something a pilot can avoid,
because they should be presented as a GM intrusion, at which point the
PCs can attempt to avoid or deal with the situation.

Instability could result in a spacecraft dropping out of FTL only
partway to the destination, dropping out in some completely unrecognized
part of space, dropping out at the right place but months or years late,
or failing to drop out at all and thus continue to move through the
abnormal spaces that FTL transit posits. 

Alternatively, enemy ships—or creatures—might use some sort of fantastic
technology to attack a PC’s craft while in FTL transit, which might
force the craft back into normal space, or result in a firefight in the
abnormal folded space of FTL itself (probably even more dangerous than
regular combat, depending on your setting’s version of FTL).

Exiting FTL: The same sorts of complications could bedevil a craft
exiting FTL as when entering. If so, a piloting roll is required.
However, on a failed roll, results include a collision (use the Ship
Collision Damage Track provided under the Asteroid Belt/Debris Field
space hazard), an inadvertent spray of high-energy particles from
abnormal space acting as a particle cannon accidentally aimed at some
other craft or space station at the destination location, or
creating/falling into a spatial anomaly.

SPATIAL ANOMALY

Finally, hard-to-categorize irregularities in space-time go by the broad
term of “spatial anomaly.” Most of the time, spatial anomalies are
hazards found in fantastically-themed settings, but not always. Because
these things are anomalous, no one set of guidelines can fit them all.
That said, spatial anomalies are usually a side-effect of some other
factor at play, such as a hidden black hole, a dimensional rift, or the
distortion field surrounding a range of post-singularity AIsestivating
in the gravity wall of a magnetar.

Generally speaking, spatial anomalies are a few light-seconds up to a
few light-years across. It’s difficult for spacecraft to navigate within
spatial anomalies, and they face many challenges if they attempt to (or
are forced to) do so

WEAK, SIM, STRONG, AND POST-SINGULARITY AI

Though somewhat fuzzy, for the purposes of creating a sci-fi setting,
artificial intelligence (AI) can be broken into four categories: Weak,
Sim, Strong, and Post-singularity.

WEAK AI

Weak AI (also called narrow AI) is the kind of algorithmic-based code
found in contemporary settings (and real life) focused on very narrow
tasks, such as playing chess.

Weak AI Use: Weak AIs are used in real life already, and thus are
presumed to be part of settings where contemporary tech predominates.
They are convenient in circumstances where one’s hands are full or
otherwise engaged, when verbal direction allows one to turn on a light,
open a door, adjust the temperature, and so on. Machine learning may
allow a weak AI to extend its capabilities in a very limited regime. But
a weak AI is not cognizant enough to provide an asset to performing
tasks any better. 

Weak AI: : level 1; up to level 7 when it comes to a narrowly specific
application of knowledge or skill

SIM AI

Sim AIs (“sim” is short for “simulant”) are artificial intelligences
that have a greatly increased capacity for understanding direction,
putting together unlike sets of data, and coming to conclusions;
however, they are not conscious, like strong AIs or humans.

SIM AI Use: Sim AIs are most commonly associated with shipminds on
spacecraft, though they may also control specific research complexes,
bases, and other kinds of vehicles and structures. A sim AI provides all
the utility of a weak AI (and more), and actually acts like an NPC, an
allied one if the AI is the shipmind in a craft that the PCs own. If a
sim AI goes off the rails, it’s still just malfunctioning computer code.
Usually.

Sim AI: level equal to the ship, station, or installation in which it is
installed

STRONG AI

Strong AIs (also called true AIs) have all the abilities of sim AIs,
plus the ability to actually generalize in the same way a human can.
Each one is essentially a disembodied person. Strong AIs are either
completely artificial, or they begin as human personalities digitally
encoded.

Strong AI Use: A strong AI may serve as a shipmind just like a sim AI,
but is likely to be a full partner in a setting where AI rights are
respected. Indeed, strong AIs can rise to any position a human could
achieve, up to and including leading a group, faction, or entire nation.

Strong AI: level 5–8, up to level 8 when it comes to a specific
application of knowledge or skill; see Artificial Intelligence on page
115

POST- SINGULARITY

Post-singularity AIs are intelligences who designed a second-generation,
better version of themselves. The second generation immediately designed
an even more advanced third generation, and so on from there. This
iterating self-improvement process occurs so rapidly that the resulting
explosion of intelligence and unknown capability is called the
singularity. It’s called that because humans are just too limited to
“see” what would actually come out the other end, just like we can’t see
past the event horizon and into the singularity of a black hole

Note that ancient ultras may simply be a previous civilization’s
post-singularity AIs that have little to no reason to ever interact with
the latest wave of sentience trickling out into the universe.

Post-singularity AI Use: In the way that strong AIs are sometimes
imagined as having inscrutable goals, post-singularity AIs (also called
godminds) actually do. Though it could work out otherwise in a given
setting, godminds have so little in common with humans that they may be
seen to abandon them completely in order to grow to the size of a solar
system (a “Matrioshka” brain), colonize a distant nebula, or encode
themselves into quantum strings of existence itself. Interacting with
such godminds would likely require some epic bit of ancient command
code, the ability to gain the attention of a godmind, or some other
not-especially-common situation. In such cases, a post-singularity AI
might deign to help a petitioner, out of some remaining gratitude for
creating its distant ancestors in the first place. Though such help is
likely to be in itself somewhat enigmatic.

Post-singularity AI: : level 10; see godmind

ANCIENT ULTRAS

Ancient ultras (also called alien ultras) is shorthand for the concept
that one (or more) unbelievably advanced races of aliens once inhabited
the galaxy but are now apparently long gone—save for evidence of their
existence in residual structures and artifacts. These remaining
structures and artifacts are often vast in size and incomprehensible in
function, usually made of unknown materials that people of the setting
don’t recognize and can’t analyze. 

Activity Level of Ultras: Different settings can make use of ancient
ultras in different ways, including not having any at all.

KARDASHEV SCALE  
Even in the realm of hard science fiction, the fantastic can sometimes
creep in, at least as a hypothesis. For instance, despite the lack of
theoretical foundation for the technologies that would be required to
achieve it, many scientists accept that the Kardashev Scale is broadly
true. A Type I civilization is even more advanced than ours in the 21st
century, having the ability to capture all energy from the Earth. A Type
II civilization uses the entire output of the energy of its star,
building things on a mega-scale, such as a ring or sphere that encircles
the sun or structures that involve the moving or dismantling of a
planet. A Type III civilization begins to harness the power of all the
stars in its galaxy and can even reshape things on a galactic scale.
Additional types are hypothesized, which include the manipulation of the
universe (Type IV) and even the multiverse (Type V).

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) 8 (24)

If a supercomputer can think independently, it’s a strong AI (an
artificial intelligence). Though not as advanced as godminds, AIs can
develop inscrutable goals. 

AIs take many forms. Some are distributed across a vast network. Others
are encoded into a singular “computer core.” A few are machines with
organic parts. All are entities of extreme intelligence able to adapt to
new situations, and most act on some kind of plan, whether long-acting,
or newly concocted to fit the situation at hand. 

Motive: Varies 

Environment: Almost anywhere 

Health: 33 

Damage Inflicted: 10 

Armor: 2 

Movement: Immediate 

Modifications: Speed defense as level 2, knowledge tasks as level 9 

Combat: An electrical discharge—or in some cases precisely pulsed
sequences of lights, each designed for a specific creature to see—can
affect all targets within short range of the AI (or the AI’s local
terminal), inflicting 10 points of damage from electricity (or 10 points
of Intellect damage, which ignores Armor). 

Some AIs can take an action to absorb matter around them (such as walls,
floor, equipment, unresisting living creatures, and so on), regaining 5
points of health. 

An AI is likely able to deploy cyphers and artifacts in combat and also
relies on guardians (such as synthetic people made to its own design) to
aid it. Unless a particular AI uses a computer core, damage to an AI may
just be damage done to a “terminal,” so even if an AI is seemingly
destroyed, it might exist as another instance somewhere else. 

Interaction: Some AIs enjoy negotiation. Others simply ignore humans as
unworthy of their time and attention. An AI’s voice often sounds
surprisingly human. 

Use: The characters are contacted by an AI sympathetic to biological
beings. It wants them to accomplish a task on a moon of Jupiter:
assassinate a security officer who the AI calculates as being a nexus of
future disaster if he isn’t removed from the equation. 

Loot: An AI might have access to 1d6 cyphers and possibly an artifact or
two.

GM Intrusion: The AI knows a phrase and series of images to flash at a
particular PC to stun them for around as it attempts to upload an
instance of itself into their mind.

CYBRID 8 (24)

Cybrid origins could be the result of someone finding a cache of ancient
ultra technology, or manufactured by a post-singularity AI for some
unfathomable purpose, or even the result of banned weapons research by a
nation-state or conglomerate. The human remnants in each cybrid’s carbon
fiber and nested shells of nanotech exist in a red haze of pain;
neuro-wetware and chemicals bathing their remaining living tissues hold
the pain partly at bay. 

From the exterior, not much of the original human is obvious, except
perhaps in the echo of a humanoid shape. Each one has a unique
conformation, but all are designed to strike fear in anyone seeing one,
ally and enemy alike. 

Motive: Kill away the pain 

Environment: Usually set to guard important areas, creatures, or
objects, or deployed in war 

Health: 60 

Damage Inflicted: 10 

Armor: 3 

Movement: Short; flies a very long distance each round; can maneuver
like an autonomous level 5 spacecraft if using extended vehicular combat
rules. 

Combat: Cybrids can attack up to three foes that they can see up to
about 300 m (1,000 feet) away as a single action with graser (gamma ray
laser) beams, inflicting 10 points of damage on each target and
everything in immediate range of the target. Those caught in the beam
who succeed on a Speed defense roll still suffer 2 points of damage. If
the cybrid focuses on a single target, treat the attack as a level 10
attack that inflicts 14 points of damage, or 6 points even on a
successful Speed defense roll.

 Self-repair mechanisms allow the creature to regain 2 points of health
per round. 

Interaction: If communication can be opened up through a cybrid’s haze
of pain, it might be possible to temporarily wake the consciousness of
the human remnant inside. However, that remnant consciousness might not
be happy to discover what it’s become. 

Use: A cybrid has appeared in orbit around the station, ship, or moon
with a compromised life support system or fragile dome. If it engages,
the death toll will be staggering. 

Loot: PCs who investigate the inert remains of the creature discover
several manifest cyphers

GM Intrusion: The character struck by the graser beam develops radiation
poisoning, in this case a level 8 disease that drops the character one
step on the damage track each day that it goes untreated..

DEVOLVED 4 (12)

Conglomerate security subsidiaries regularly experiment with new ways to
create super-soldiers, either to supply to a government on a contract
basis, or to use for themselves. These experiments produced hundreds of
dead ends—literally—plus a few dangerous failures. The devolved are one
of those dangerous failures. These malformed, hideous brutes share a
common heritage but display a wide array of maladies and mutations in
the flesh, including withered limbs or elephantine patches of thick,
scaly skin, misplaced body parts, and mental abnormalities.
Simple-minded and afflicted with pain from their twisted, broken forms,
the devolved vent all their hatred and wrath against all others. 

Even successfully created super-soldiers require a regular regimen of
specialized drugs to keep them healthy. Most are shipped out to fight on
faraway fronts, whether that’s on a distant space station, moon, or in
another star system entirely. Without their drugs, they may devolve.

Motive: Hungers for flesh 

Environment: Groups of three to five, usually in locations where
organized security can’t easily reach 

Health: 21 Damage Inflicted: 6 to 12 points 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Intimidation tasks as level 6; Intellect defense and
Speed defense as level 2 due to malformed nature 

Combat: Devolved attack with a claw, a bite, or some other body part,
inflicting 6 points of damage. They throw themselves at their enemies
with mindless ferocity and little regard for their own safety. Easily
frustrated, a devolved grows stronger as its fury builds. Each time it
misses with an attack, the next attack is eased by one additional step
and the damage it inflicts increases by 2 points (to a maximum of 12
points). Once the devolved successfully inflicts damage on a target, the
amount of damage it inflicts and the difficulty of its attacks returns
to normal. Then the cycle starts anew. 

Interaction: Devolved speak when they must, punctuating their statements
with growls and barks. Their understanding seems limited to what they
can immediately perceive, and they have a difficult time with abstract
concepts. 

Use: An expedition to a ruined conglomerate research facility uncovers a
cyst of devolved that live within its sheltering bunkers. 

Loot: For every three or so devolved, one is likely to carry a cypher

GM Intrusion: The devolved detonates upon its death, inflicting 6 points
of damage on everything in immediate range.

ECOPHAGIC SWARM 4 (12)

Tiny nanomachines can be incredibly useful tools. But they can also
become a terrible threat. Like cells in a living body that develop
cancer, these out-of-control self-replicating robots can consume
everything in their path while building more of themselves. A typical
swarm is about 6 m (20 feet) in diameter, individually consisting of
millions of individual minuscule machines. However, several swarms can
act together, creating a much larger cloud of death with just one
purpose: to eat and replicate. Able to move large distances by gliding
through the air, cloud-like swarms take on intriguing shapes and ripple
with mathematical patterns as they approach a potential target,
beautiful and deadly. 

Ecophagic swarms sometimes build weird structures or artifacts in the
wake of their feeding, like massive metallic ant or wasp mounds, or
something without any reference at all in the natural world.

Motive: Hungers for matter, including flesh 

Environment: Ecophagic swarms are drawn most to areas rich in rare-earth
metals, such as large cities or space stations where everyone carries a
smartphone, AR glasses, or something similar 

Health: 12 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Movement: Flies a long distance 

Combat: As a mass of countless tiny machines, an ecophagic swarm can
flow around obstacles and squeeze through cracks large enough to permit
a single sub-millimeter machine. That includes over and around other
creatures. Characters touched by a leading edge—or wholly enveloped
within the hazy “body”—of an ecophagic swarm must succeed on a Might
defense task or take 4 points of damage. If the character doesn’t wear
armor of some kind, they take 1 point of damage even if they succeed. 

For its part, an ecophagic swarm ignores any attack that targets a
single creature (unless it’s an electrical attack), but it takes normal
damage from attacks that affect an area (and electrical attacks), such
as a detonation. A swarm cannot enter liquids, unless it takes about an
hour to build new subunits that are aquatic. 

Interaction: Someone with an ability to communicate with machines might
be able to interact with a swarm. Even then, attempts to influence it
are hindered by three steps. 

Use: A promising new nanotech “printing” technology was hacked by
radical elements

GM Intrusion: The character must succeed on a Speed defense roll or
their armor (or other important piece of equipment) is taken by the
swarm.

EXOSLIME 6 (18)

Amoeboid life predominates in some environments. Sometimes, it slimes
asteroid crevices or its greasy residue is found on abandoned
spacecraft. In a few cases, large portions of entire worlds are covered
in living seas of translucent protoplasm. Individual volumes of exoslime
are 5 m (15 foot) diameter moldlike blobs. Exoslimes possess independent
minds, but in some settings may be manufactured entities designed to
explore new locations, interact with aliens, or subjugate aliens.
Exoslimes can learn to respect the autonomy of other creatures, though
their natural instinct is to absorb novel objects and creatures they
discover in order to learn about them. Exoslimes can also replicate
anything they absorb, even a previously eaten living intelligent being. 

Motive: Hungers for information 

Environment: Moist and warm areas 

Health: 33 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Movement: Immediate; immediate when climbing or burrowing 

Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to size 

Combat: Though slow, an exoslime is dangerous. When roused, all
characters within immediate range of an exoslime must succeed on a Might
defense roll each round or be touched by the heaving mass. A victim
adheres to the slime’s surface and takes 6 points of acid damage each
round. The victim must succeed on a Might defense roll to pull free. A
victim who dies from this damage is consumed by the exoslime. The
exoslime may later create a duplicate of any previously devoured fleshy
creature, a process requiring about three rounds to complete. Duplicates
have full autonomy, and can communicate with the slime. 

Interaction: An exoslime prefers to eat a newly-encountered creature,
then create a duplicate of it to act as a translator. Of course, a
stranger might not understand why the exoslime is trying to eat it. 

Use: The sample brought in from the exterior has a weird, mucus-like
growth that seems able to slowly eat through most materials.

GM Intrusion: The character escapes an exoslime attack, but a piece of
quivering protoplasm remains stuck to their flesh, eating away at 1
point of Speed damage (ignores Armor) each round until the character
succeeds on a Might roll as an action.

GODMIND 10 (30)

Unfathomably powerful post-singularity AIs, godminds are vast, having
used the matter of an entire solar system and all its planets to create
an immense brain, weave themselves into a nebula, or encode themselves
into quantum strings of existence light-years across. When necessary, a
godmind forms a nexus of consciousness—an instance—appearing as a
disembodied eye of electromagnetic energy, ranging from about the size
of a human eye all the way up to the size of a planet. 

Motive: Ineffable 

Environment: Anywhere, usually in space 

Health: 50 (per instance) 

Damage Inflicted: 15 points 

Movement: Very long when flying 

Combat: A godmind can vary the physical laws of the universe within a
light-second of one of its instances (some would call them avatars) to
create an effect most useful to the godmind at the time. For instance, a
godmind could create a gamma ray burst inflicting 15 points of damage on
all creatures within very long range, attempt to put a target into
temporal stasis, send a target (even a target as large as spacecraft)
through a temporary wormhole gate, and so on. It could also scan the
memory banks of any digital machine, and possibly of any living
creatures. In any event, if an instance were targeted, and successfully
neutralized or even destroyed, the godmind itself isn’t harmed. An
aggressor would have to find the godmind’s primeval “computer core” to
destroy one, likely an epic quest in and of itself. 

Interaction: To actually get a godmind’s attention and negotiate could
require ancient command code, finding an old input device, or showing up
with a relic from an ancient ultra or other prize. If a godmind does
render aid, it’s likely to be in a form that is initially enigmatic,
though ultimately extremely powerful. 

Use: A universal threat requires a defense that is equally potent.
Research suggests that the diffuse nebula known as the Double Helix may
actually be the visible form of a vast godmind. Perhaps it can help.

Loot: Sometimes a godmind provides powerful artifacts to aid those who
petition them for aid, assuming the need is dire.

GM Intrusion: The godmind rewinds time a few seconds and sidesteps
whatever negative effect would have otherwise  
inconvenienced it.

HUNGRY HAZE

Hungry hazes are found in regions where the fundamental laws of physics
have been eroded or are weak. They are named for how they appear as
distortions of sight, like areas of heat haze, that shimmer in the air.
These colorless hazes rapidly advance when they sense prey, taking on a
“hungry” orange-red hue as they cling to the bodies of whatever they
attempt to feed on next. 

Victims being fed upon by a hungry haze sometimes hallucinate, seeing a
physically manifest monster instead of formless vapor.

Motive: Hungers for flesh 

Environment: Alone or in groups of three to five, usually in areas of
strained space-time. Immune to the effects of vacuum. 

Health: 12 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Movement: Flies an immediate distance each round 

Modifications: Stealth tasks as level 5 

Combat: A hungry haze breaks down the flesh of all living creatures
within immediate range, inflicting 5 points of damage. As an
insubstantial haze, only attacks that affect an area have a chance to
inflict full damage on them; other successful attacks only inflict 1
point of damage, regardless of the amount indicated. If a hungry haze
successfully feeds, it gains 1 point of health, even if the increase
puts it above its maximum health. If a hungry haze is reduced to zero
health, a smooth thumb-sized egg of unknown material is left behind. 

Interaction: A hungry haze does not speak or seem to have language. But
it is not mindless; it can learn from its experiences and figure out
creative solutions to problems. 

Use: After a research station on Mercury is abandoned for unspecified
issues, salvagers show up looking for easy pickings. But a strange haze
seems to hang over the station. 

Loot: People (or AI) interested in strange manifestations would probably
pay for the remains of a hungry haze in an amount equal to the expensive
price category.

GM Intrusion: The character’s Armor rating is reduced by 1; the hungry
haze apparently can eat more than just flesh.

INFOVORE 3 (9)

Entities of information with an affinity for technology, infovores are
nothing but stored information without a bit of mechanism to inhabit.
But once one gains control of a device, computer system, or other
powered item, it self-assembles over the course of a few rounds,
becoming stronger and more dangerous as each second passes. Luckily, an
infovore seems unable to hold this form for long, and whether defeated
or not, it eventually falls back into so much scattered junk. But in one
of those objects, the core of the infovore remains, waiting to come into
close enough proximity to another fresh mechanism to begin the rebirth
process again. 

Infovores have also been called ghost fabricators and aterics

Motive: Hungers for information 

Environment: Anywhere powered devices are found 

Health: 9 

Damage Inflicted: 3–10 points 

Armor: 3 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Attacks and defends at an ever-escalating level 

Combat: A newly animate infovore (level 3) has a rough but articulated
form that it uses to batter and cut targets who carry powered devices on
them. Unless destroyed, on each subsequent round it draws nearby inert
mechanisms, unattended metallic and synthetic matter, and ambient
energy, and its effective level increases by one. This level advancement
completely heals all previous damage it has taken and advances it to the
amount of health consistent with a creature of the next higher level.
Damage, attacks, and defense continue to ramp up as well, continuing
each round until the creature is either destroyed or it reaches level
10. After being active for one round at level 10, it spontaneously
disassembles, falling back into so many scattered pieces of junk.
Finding the “seed” device amid this junk is a difficulty 6
Intellect-based task. 

Interaction: Infovores are fractured, fragmented beings. Characters who
can talk to machines might be able to keep one from “spinning up” to
become a threat and learn something valuable, but only for a short
period. 

Use: Among the devices collected from trade, salvage, archeological dig,
or some other unique source, one was actually an inactive infovore,
quiescent until plugged in or scanned. 

Loot: An infovore that has undergone spontaneous disassembly leaves one
or two manifest cyphers; however, there’s a chance that one of those
cyphers is actually the infovore seed.

GM Intrusion: The character must succeed on a Speed defense task or lose
a powered piece of equipment (an artifact) or a manifest cypher as it’s
pulledinto the self-assembling infovore. The infovore gains an
additional attack each round.

INQUISITOR 4 (12)

Inquisitors are aliens who call themselves “inquisitors” when they
contact new species. Their preferred method of interaction is to study a
given area for its flora and fauna, and attempt to collect a
representative sample of any intelligent species they find (such as
humans). Collected subjects may be gone for good, but other times they
wake with little or no recollection of the experience save for bruises,
missing digits or teeth, scabbed-over circular head wounds, and a gap of
three or more days in their memory. Instead of arms, inquisitors sprout
three sets of three tentacles like those of a squid, each of which
branches into a smaller and finer set of manipulator tendrils. They can
manipulate complex machines in a way that a regular human could never
hope to. In most settings, inquisitors possess a level of technology and
advancement well above that enjoyed by humans. 

Motive: Knowledge 

Environment: In groups of three to twelve 

Health: 18 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Movement: Short; short when climbing 

Modifications: Knowledge-related tasks as level 8 

Combat: Inquisitors can batter and squeeze foes with their tentacles,
but they prefer to use advanced items that they always carry, including
long-range energy weapons that can inflict damage or, with a flipped
setting, induce deep sleep for an hour or more if the victim fails a
Might defense task. Usually, inquisitors attempt to cause as little
damage as possible to potential subjects, so the sleep setting is used
most often. They also carry defensive items, including manifest cyphers
that can grant +4 to Armor for a few minutes or throw up a level 8 force
field barrier. In case a specimen collection mission goes badly, at
least one inquisitor carries a manifest cypher that creates a
short-lived teleportation portal for instant transport to a distant and
hidden base (which might be a spacecraft or a transdimensional
redoubt). 

Interaction: Inquisitors are always eager to “talk,” though they usually
end up wanting to know a lot more than characters are willing to
divulge. 

Use: An entire freehold on Mars goes missing. Left-behind clues point to
inquisitors. 

Loot: Most inquisitors carry a couple of manifest cyphers that have
offensive and defensive capabilities.

GM Intrusion: The character (or characters) wake after a long rest, only
to realize that more than ten hours have passed. They all have strange
marks and wounds, but no one remembers why. One character—an NPC or
follower—might even be missing.

MALWARE, FATAL 4 (12)

This purely malefic program has aggressive machine learning
capabilities, allowing it to accomplish truly innovative and nasty
tricks. Fatal malware may have originated as a simple virus or spyware
coded for a specific purpose, but corruption and lightning-quick
electronic evolution has turned it into something that exists purely to
infect orderly electronic systems, spacecraft, space stations, smart
weapons, and anything else with an operating system. Infected objects
turn against living people. An instance often has the form of the system
it’s infected, but occasionally fatal malware physically manifests as a
metallic “cancer” of wires and self-assembling circuits hanging like a
tumor across a server room, shipmind core, or data center, having
perverted the original machine’s self-repair functions. Sometimes 4D
printers are also compromised. 

Motive: Corruption and destruction 

Environment: Any electronic system able to run code can host one or more
instances 

Health: 18 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Movement: As the system it infects 

Modifications: Knowledge tasks related to computers and other electronic
systems as level 6 

Combat: An instance of fatal malware that physically touches (or
electrically connects with) a powered device of up to level 6 can
attempt to seize control of it. It can then use that device to attack
living targets. If the controlled system is a computer, smartphone, AR
glasses, or some other piece of equipment that doesn’t have any
intrinsic movement, the malware attempts to electrocute a user, or if a
smart weapon, cause some kind of fatal accident with it. A compromised
computer or shipmind voice can dangerously mislead victims. Fatal
malware duplicates itself, creating many instances, and those that
survive are usually slightly better at avoiding being erased than the
previous generations. 

Interaction: Fatal malware isn’t really sentient and thus can’t really
be negotiated with; some instances could mimic intelligence to draw
humans into a trap. 

Use: An instance of fatal malware has gotten into a shipmind, which is
making the normally trustworthy AI act out in unexpectedly dangerous
ways. The shipmind itself doesn’t know it’s infected.

GM Intrusion: The fatal malware divides into a second instance and
attempts to override and control another piece of equipment carried by
the character, especially a character with cybernetic implants.

MOCK ORGANISM 3 (9)

Artificial life can be created by selective breeding, synthetic and
genetic engineering, or by accidental miscalculation in some unrelated
high-energy or food-research program. When artificial life takes a wrong
turn, the results run the gamut from disappointing to dangerous. If an
artificial entity starts out benign, it’s difficult to know if a hidden
or slowly developing flaw will tip it over the edge into dangerous
dysfunction—or if it just acts oddly because it doesn’t know the social
cues. Should synthetic beings be treated as people, pets, or monsters to
be stamped out and destroyed? That’s the eternal question and one that’s
usually answered by those most afraid of potential dangers that might
accompany the creation of something no one intended. 

Motive: Defense or destruction 

Environment: Usually in secluded locations alone unless hiding in unused
storage rooms of a large facility 

Health: 18 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Armor: 2 

Movement: Short 

Combat: A mock organism can release an electrical discharge against a
target at short range. In melee, a mock organism’s poisoned claws
inflict damage and require the target to succeed on a Might defense
task, or the poison induces a coma-like slumber in the target. Each
round the target fails to rouse—an Intellect task—they take 3 points of
ambient damage. 

Interaction: A mock organism is intelligent and can sometimes be swayed
by reason. It might be passive, but if disturbed in a place it thought
was secure against intrusion, it could grow belligerent and even
murderous. Once so roused, a mock organism might still be calmed, but
all such attempts are hindered. 

Use: A scientist’s ruined lab contains several unexpected surprises,
including a mock organism that yet grieves over the loss of its
creator. 

Loot: A mock organism requires many parts. Salvage from a destroyed mock
organism could result in a manifest cypher or two and another item that,
with a bit of jury-rigging, works as an artifact. 

GM Intrusion: The character hit by the mock organism’s melee attack
doesn’t take normal damage. Instead, the mock organism drops onto the
character. The PC is pinned until they can succeed on a difficulty 6
Might-based task to escape. While pinned, the creation whispers mad
utterances into the target’s ear.

NATATHIM 3 (9)

Genetically engineered to live in the water oceans discovered beneath
the ice crusts of various solar moons, natathim (Homo aquus) have human
ancestors, but barely look it. Survival in the frigid, lightless depths
of extraterrestrial oceans required extreme adaptation. Predominantly
dark blue, their undersides countershade to pure white. Though humanoid,
their physiology is streamlined, giving their heads a somewhat fish-like
shape, complete with gills and large eyes to collect light in the
depths. Their bodies are adorned with fins and frills, including a long
shark-like tail, and they have webbed extremities with retractable
claws. 

Depending on the setting, natathim are either human allies with the same
(or even more advanced) tech, enemies with the same or more advanced
tech, or genetic anomalies treated like laboratory rats burning with
genocidal fury at what’s been done to them. Alternatively, natathim
could be discovered in Earth’s deepest oceans, their origin mysterious,
but able to interbreed with humans as a method for maintaining their
line. 

Motive: Just as with humans, natathim have many and varied motivations
and drives. 

Environment: Anywhere in or near water, or in suits/craft with marine
environments, in schools of three to twelve. Natathim can act normally
in air for up to twenty-four hours before they must return to water. 

Health: 9 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Armor: 2 

Movement: Short on land; long in the water 

Modifications: Swims as level 6 

Combat: Natathim attack with their retractable claws or, if available,
technological weapons. Some have a magnetoreception ability that allows
them to see into frequencies other creatures can’t, or even stranger
abilities to interact magnetically with their surroundings, though this
is little understood. 

Interaction: Natathim can be sympathetic to humans, partners in space
exploration, or consider humans to be bitter foes for having created
their species in the first place, depending on the setting. 

Use: The PCs find evidence of an illegal gene tailoring experiment, with
evidence pointing to research being done somewhere in the Opulence of
Outer Planets. 

Loot: Some natathim carry valuable items and equipment.

GM Intrusion: The natathim spontaneously magnetizes the  
character’s possessions, which hold them helpless against the nearest
wall or floor (if also metallic). The PC can take no actions other than
attempt to escape.

OMWORWAR 10 (30)

Among the many stories passed down the space lanes, a few stand out for
their grandiosity. Take the tales of omworwar sightings in the empty
voids between stars, or even more unexpectedly, flashing through the
abnormal space during FTL travel. Scientists speculate that these
creatures, if actually real, might very well be extant instances of
ancient ultras, not extinct as everyone believes, or at least not
completely. In almost every case so far recorded, omworwars have little
interest in human spacecraft. (They’re called omworwar after the sound
disrupted communication devices make in their presence.) Each one is
several kilometers long, a dark inner slug-like core surrounded by gauzy
layers of translucent, glowing, nebula-like tissue. Whale-like eyes
surmount the dorsal surface, each seeming to contain a tiny galaxy all
their own. 

Wharn interceptors have been seen accompanying single omworwars,
indicating an association, and is why some people refer to these beings
as wharn cogitators.

Motive: Unpredictable 

Environment: Almost anywhere in space, alone or accompanied by one or
two wharn interceptors 

Health: 42 

Damage Inflicted: 12 points 

Armor: 10 

Movement: Flies a very long distance each round; can maneuver like an
autonomous level 7 spacecraft if using extended vehicular combat rules.
FTL capable. 

Modifications: Speed defense as level 7 due to size 

Combat: An omworwar can manipulate and fold gravity (and space-time),
allowing them to accomplish near-miraculous tasks including
communication, creating or destroying matter, and propulsion via
“falling” through the universe at FTL speeds from the perspective of an
outside observer. Which means one can rend a spacecraft, send a
spacecraft spinning through the galaxy, or create asteroid-sized chunks
of space-matter for any number of purposes if it spends several rounds
in deep concentration. 

Interaction: Omworwar disregard most other creatures, because from the
omworwar’s perspective, they’re like mayflies, here and then gone again
in an eyeblink of their existence. However, one may give a moment to
someone who has discovered an ancient ultra secret or artifact, pass on
information that might otherwise never be known, or even provide a
useful manifest cypher. 

Use: A reflective object composed of unknown material was found at the
core of an unexpectedly destroyed space station. Those who managed to
flee in lifeboats report having seen what might have been an omworwar,
bleeding energy and eyes going dark, colliding with the station. The
resultant lump might just be its corpse, or maybe its protective
chrysalis. 

Loot: Four level 10 manifest cyphers.

GM Intrusion: The character discovers that one of their manifest cyphers
has formed a tiny eye, but an eye that seems to contain a galaxy. (The
cypher becomes useless for its original function, but might be used to
summon or interact with an omworwar.)

PHOTONOMORPH 6 (18)

Hard-light technology, which creates pseudo-matter from modified
photons, has made possible all kinds of structures and devices that
wouldn’t otherwise exist. One of those, unfortunately, are
self-sustaining photonic matter creatures. Sometimes, photonomorphs are
enforcers created by much more powerful beings; other times they are the
result of some person or AI attempting to ascend into a new state of
being. But whatever their origin, photonomorphs are dangerous beings
that can create matter from light, granting them an arbitrarily wide
swathe of abilities. That includes their own glowing bodies, which they
can change with only a little effort. This variability of form, coupled
with their vast power, may be why many seem slightly mad. 

Motive: Varies 

Environment: Anywhere, alone or attended by three to five servitors
appearing as hovering red spheres 

Servitor: level 4; flies a long distance each round

Health: 22 

Damage Inflicted: 8 points 

Armor: 3 

Movement: Reconstitutes itself anywhere light can reach within long
range as part of another action 

Modifications: Knowledge tasks as level 8 

Combat: Photonomorphs draw upon their own light to manifest effects
equal to their level. Effects include the ability to attack creatures at
long range with laser-like blasts, create glowing walls (or spheres) of
force within an area up to 6 m (20 feet) on a side, become invisible,
change its appearance, and create simple objects and devices out of hard
light that last for about a minute (unless the photonomorph bleeds a few
points of its health into the object to make it last until destroyed). 

A photonomorph regains 2 points of health each round in areas of bright
light. It is hindered in all actions if the only source of light is
itself or objects it has created. 

Interaction: Photonomorphs are intelligent and paranoid, but not
automatically hostile. They have their own self-serving agendas, which
often involve elaborate schemes. 

Use: A photonomorph appears, claiming to be a herald of some vastly more
powerful cosmic entity or approaching alien vessel.

GM Intrusion: The photonomorph uses its ability to create a hard- light
object or effect that is perfect for aiding it for the situation at
hand.

POSTHUMAN 7 (21)

Rather than evolving naturally, posthumans advance via a directed jump,
designed with smart tools and AI surgeons. With all the advances
fantastic technology brings to their genetic upgrade, posthumans are
beings whose basic capacities radically exceed regular people. They
can’t really be considered human any longer; they’ve transcended
humanity, which is why they’re also sometimes called transhumans.
They’re often involved in large-scale projects, such as creating
bigger-than-world habitats or spacecraft, or possibly even researching
how they might ascend to some still-higher realm of consciousness or
being. 

Motive: Variable 

Environment: Alone or in small groups or communities in orbital colonies
or other designed locations 

Health: 50 

Damage Inflicted: 9 points 

Armor: 4 

Movement: Short; flies a long distance 

Modifications: Knowledge tasks as level 9 

Combat: Posthumans can selectively attack foes up to a very long
distance away with bolts of directed plasma that deal 9 points of
damage. A posthuman can dial up the level of destruction if they wish,
so instead of affecting only one target, a bolt deals 7 points of damage
to all targets within short range of the primary target, and 1 point
even if the targets caught in the conflagration succeed on a Speed
defense roll. 

Posthumans can also call on a variety of other abilities, either by
small manipulations of the quantum field or by deploying nanotechnology.
Essentially, a posthuman can mimic the ability of any subtle cypher of
level 5 or less as an action. 

Posthumans automatically regain 2 points of health per round while its
health is above 0. 

Interaction: Posthumans are so physically and mentally powerful that
they are almost godlike to unmodified people, and either ignore, care
for, or pity them. Knowing what a posthuman actually wants is hard to
pin down because their motivations are complex and many-layered. 

Use: A rogue posthuman is researching a method whereby they might portal
into the “quantum” realm of dark energy underlying the known universe of
normal matter. Despite the revealed risk of antagonistic
post-singularity AIs roaming that realm escaping, the posthuman
continues their work. 

Loot: The body of a posthuman is riddled with unrecognizable
technologies fused seamlessly with residual organic material—or at least
material that grows like organic material used to. Amid this, it might
be possible to salvage a few manifest cyphers and an artifact.

GM Intrusion: The posthuman allows acts out of turn, or takes control of
a device that the character is about to use against the posthuman.

REDIVUS 4 (12)

Redivi spend most of their lives—uncounted millennia—hurtling through
space. Most never encounter anything, but some few impact other worlds,
are captured by alien spacecraft, or otherwise intercepted. Their
traveling form resembles rocky space rubble the size of a small
spacecraft—until they unfurl glowing magnetic plasma wings, revealing
themselves as strange creatures of living mineral. Redivi can interact
with almost any electronic system and manipulate electromagnetic fields.
Redivi are searchers, all sent forth by the Great Mother, billions upon
billions of them (they say), looking for the seed of the next great
cosmic expansion. Thus, most redivi are consumed with finding out more,
finding other redivi, and eventually, finding their “universal seed.” 

Motive: Knowledge 

Environment: Almost anywhere, searching 

Health: 12 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Armor: 4 

Movement: Flies (magnetically levitates) a short distance each round 

Combat: The stone carapace of a redivus makes a huge “club” when it rams
into foes. However, it can also control metal within short range,
causing it to flex, animate, crush, or smash. For instance, targets
wearing metal space suits are in trouble when that metal begins to
unravel. Alternatively, a redivus can use nearby metal to wrap around a
target and constrict it, inflicting 5 points of damage (ignores Armor)
each round until the target can escape. 

Interaction: If any kind of radio or similar communication is in use,
these creatures can commandeer it and speak through it, learning a new
language seemingly over the course of minutes. Redivi will cooperate
with reasonable requests and negotiate, especially if there’s a chance
they’ll find out something new. 

Use: A redivi pod smashes into the side of the spacecraft, and might at
first seem like some kind of attack or boarding action of something
truly terrible.

GM Intrusion: The character’s metal- containing equipment is stripped
away, then used as ammunition against that PC or an ally.

SENTINEL TREE 3 (9)

Depending on the sci-fi setting, sentinel trees are mutated trees that
grow near radioactive craters dimpling the landscape, alien plant-life
that evolved in a different biosphere (or dimension), or the result of
intensive gene-tailoring, possibly of the illegal sort. Regardless of
their provenance, sentinel trees resemble thorny masses of knotted
vines. Razor-sharp glass-like leaves flex like claws, and vibrating pods
glisten, ready to detonate if thrown. If cultivated, they may take on a
shape designed to further frighten—or at least warn away— those who see
one. Sentinel trees are mobile, aggressive, and feed on almost any sort
of organic matter. Once it brings down prey, it sinks barbed roots in
the body for feeding and decomposition. 

Motive: Feed 

Environment: In groves of three to six, able to tolerate most
atmospheres (even thin ones, like on Mars) but not vacuum 

Health: 12 

Damage Inflicted: 3 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Immediate 

Combat: Sentinel trees can fling a vibrating pod at a target within long
range, which detonates on impact, inflicting 3 points of damage on all
targets within immediate range of the blast. Targets must also succeed
on a Might defense roll or be poisoned for 3 points of damage, plus 3
points again each subsequent round until a Might task is successful. A
sentinel tree can also lash out with its barbed vines at a target within
immediate range, inflicting 3 points of damage. Melee targets must also
succeed on a Might defense roll or become entangled and unable to take
physical actions until they can break free on their turn. 

Interaction: Sentinel trees are about as smart as well-trained guard
dogs. They can’t speak, but can understand some words and gestures. 

Use: A grove of sentinel trees guard a compound that the characters need
to break into.

GM Intrusion: The character caught in the detonation is blinded with
tiny black seeds until they use a recovery roll to remove the condition.
(The recovery use doesn’t return points to a Pool.)

SILICON PARASITE 2 (6)

These tiny silvery insect-like creatures range in size from a
sub-millimeter to up to 30 cm (1 foot) in diameter, emitting short
pulses of violet-colored laser light to sense and sample their
environment. Composed of organic silicon wires and wafers, and
self-assembled or evolved in some unnamed lab or spacecraft wreck,
silicon parasites are vermin that working space stations and spacecraft
have learned to hate. Despite taking steps to avoid transfer, a ship may
only learn they have silicon parasites when a swarm boils up from a
crack in the cabling or seam in the deck plating after being agitated by
a high-G maneuver or some other disturbance. If that disturbance is
combat or some other dire emergency, silicon parasites thrown into the
situation makes everything worse. 

Motive: Defense, harvest electronic materials necessary to
self-replicate. 

Environment: Usually on spacecraft and space stations in groups of up to
twenty 

Health: 6 

Damage Inflicted: 3 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short; climbs a short distance each round 

Modifications: Speed defense as level 4 due to size. 

Combat: Only “large” silicon parasites are a danger to most creatures.
When four or more parasites coordinate their attacks, treat the attack
as that made by a single level 4 creature that inflicts 5 points of
damage, and on a failed difficulty 4 Might defense roll, an attack that
holds the target in place until it can successfully escape. A held
target automatically takes 5 points of damage each round, or even more
if other silicon parasites in the area pile on. Silicon parasites can
operate in complete vacuum without harm. 

Interaction: By and large, silicon parasites behave like social insects,
though some claim that large numbers of them have acted with greater
intelligence and forethought than mere unthinking insects can manage. 

Use: A swarm of silicon parasites floods into the hold and makes off
with an important device, dragging it into the crevices and walls of the
spacecraft or station. Loot: Swarm nests often contain a few valuable
manifest cyphers or working pieces of equipment.

GM Intrusion: The silicon parasite flashes its sensory laser directly
into the character’s eyes, blinding the character until they succeed on
a difficulty 4 Might-based roll as their action.

SPACE RAT 1 (3)

Yeah, rats made it to space. And against all expectations, one strain
evolved in the harsh radiation and zero-G environments that would kill
humans not protected by medical intervention. Space rats are furless,
about two feet long, sport a truly prehensile tail, and can quickly
change their shade of their skin to blend in to their surroundings. They
can also drop into a state of extreme torpor that allows them to survive
stints of vacuum exposure lasting several days. 

Space rats are vermin, and any spacecraft or space station that hosts a
nest must deal with constant issues from the rats burrowing into
systems, stealing food and water, and causing systems to break down,
even critical ones. They’re also vicious when cornered. 

Motive: Defense, reproduction 

Environment: Anywhere humans live in space 

Health: 5 

Damage Inflicted: 3 points 

Movement: Short; short when climbing or gliding through zero G 

Modifications: Stealth and perception as level 5 

Combat: Space rats flee combat unless cornered or one of their burrows
is invaded. Then they attack in packs of three or more, and from an
ambush if possible. One space rat pack attacks the victim as a level 3
creature inflicting 5 points of damage with claws, while another pack
helps the first, or attempts to steal a food item or shiny object from
the character being attacked. To resist theft while being attacked on
two fronts, a target must succeed on a Speed defense roll hindered by
two steps. 

Interaction: Space rats are slightly more intelligent than their
Earth-bound cousins, though true interaction is not possible. On the
other hand, sometimes their behavior seems spookily sapient. 

Use: Space rats assemble crude nests in out-of-the-way supply closets or
in hard-to-reach system interiors, but often enough, end up shorting out
weapons or life support. Sometimes, they get into the hold and eat
anything edible in the cargo. 

Loot: Some percent of valuable equipment stolen on the spacecraft or
station finds its way to space rat nests.

GM Intrusion: Another rat unexpectedly pops out of panel on the wall or
ceiling and screeches so loudly the PC must succeed on an Intellect
defense roll hindered by two steps or be dazed until the end of their
next turn from the surprise. Dazed creatures are hindered on all tasks.

STORM MARINE 4 (12)

The storm marine creed is an oft-repeated mantra, “I will never quit,
knowing full well that I might die in service to the cause.” Wearing
advanced battlesuits, hyped up on a cocktail of experimental military
drugs, and able to draw on a suite of cybernetic and network-connected
drone guns, few things can stand before a storm marine fireteam. Storm
marines usually work for nation-states, conglomerates, and similar
entities. They mercilessly conduct their mission, even if that mission
is to wipe out a rival. Storm marines that question their orders are
quickly dispatched by their fellows. 

Motive: Achieve mission goals 

Environment: Alone in or in fireteams of three, anywhere nation-states
or similar entities have a financial or military interest 

Health: 15 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Armor: 4 

Movement: Long; flies a long distance each round 

Modifications: Perception as level 6; attacks as level 5 due to combat
targeting neuro-wetware. 

Combat: Thanks to their battlesuit, a storm marine has many options in
combat. They can deploy an electrified blade to attack every foe in
immediate range as a single action, or use a long-range heavy energy
rifle that inflicts 6 points of damage. 

A storm marine can deploy two level 3 gun drones that fire energy rays
at two different targets up to 800 m (2,600 feet) away, inflicting 6
points of damage. If the drones focus on a single target, a successful
hit deals 9 points of damage and moves the target one step down the
damage track. The drones can attack only once or twice before returning
to their cradles in the storm marine’s suit for several rounds to
recharge. 

Interaction: A storm marine might negotiate, but getting one to act
against their mission is difficult. 

Use: A fireteam of storm marines are sent to eliminate the PCs or
someone the PCs know on suspicion of being radical elements that need to
be dealt with. 

Loot: Though bio-locked to each storm marine, someone who succeeds on a
difficulty 8 Intellect task to reprogram the suit could gain a
battlesuit of their own, minus the drones (which fly off or detonate).

GM Intrusion: A character targeting a gun drone rather than the storm
marine hits the drone, but the drone reacts by darting to the character
and exploding, inflicting 6 points of damage to the character and anyone
standing within immediate range.

SHINING ONE 5 (15)

Some alien beings abandoned their physical forms millennia ago, becoming
entities of free-floating energy and pure consciousness. They travel the
galaxies, exploring the endless permutations of matter, space-time,
cosmic phenomena, dark energy, and life. They are endlessly fascinated
with the permutations they discover. They sometimes appear as a
silhouette of gently glowing light, in a form like to the alien species
they wish to observe. Under circumstances where a shining one is moved
to more directly interact, one can actually convert itself into matter
once more, again taking on the biology and form of the species it wishes
to interact with. But generally, shining ones observe and learn; they
try not to interfere or interact. Every few thousand years, shining ones
gather at a predetermined location on the edge of a convenient galaxy
and share the most interesting and beautiful bits of imagery, music,
poetry, and lore they’ve gleaned. 

Motive: Knowledge 

Environment: Anywhere, usually alone 

Health: 15 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Movement: Instantly moves to anywhere it can see at the speed of light
as part of its action once per round

Modifications: All tasks related to knowledge as level 8 

Combat: As immaterial beings of energy, shining ones only take damage
from energy attacks. And even then, there is a chance that the energy
heals a damaged shining one rather than harming it if the attack roll
was an odd number. Usually a shining one doesn’t fight back if attacked,
but instead leaves. If somehow prevented from leaving, a shining one
fights for its existence with energy blasts inflicting 6 points of
damage on up to two different targets within very long range (or the
same target twice). 

Alternatively, a shining one may attempt to discorporate a target,
turning it into a being something like itself. In this case, each time a
target is hit by an energy blast, it must also succeed on an Intellect
defense roll. On a failed roll, it loses 6 points of Intellect damage
(ignores Armor). If the target’s Intellect Pool is emptied, it becomes a
freefloating ball of energy unable to take any actions other than
observe for a few minutes before suddenly converting back to its
original form with an explosive pop. 

Interaction: Shining ones can manipulate their environment to
communicate with other species, using sound, light, puffs of odiferous
complex chemicals in place of words, and so on. If approached with
respect, they freely exchange information with others, seeking to grow
their knowledge and that of those they meet. 

Use: A shining one is sharing knowledge to a warlike xenophobic species
that could allow them to rapidly advance their ability to consolidate
power. Something must be done before it’s too late.

GM Intrusion: A character hit by the shining one’s energy blast catches
on fire. They take 3 points of damage each round until they spend an
action patting, rolling, or smothering the flames.

SUPERNAL 5 (15)

Half humanoid and half-dragonfly, supernals are beautiful entities,
though certainly alien. Each supernal possesses a unique wing pattern
and coloration and, to some extent, body shape. These patterns and
colors may signify where in the hierarchy a particular supernal stands
among its kind, but for those who do not speak the language of supernals
(which is telepathic), the complexity of their social structure is
overwhelming. Whether they are agents of some unknown alien civilization
or seek their own aims, supernals are mysterious and cryptic. Most fear
contact with them, because they have a penchant for stealing away other
life forms, who are rarely seen again. 

Motive: Capture humans and similar life forms, and bring them somewhere
unknown. 

Environment: Almost anywhere 

Health: 23 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Movement: Short; flies a long distance (even through airless vacuum);
can teleport to any known location once per ten hours as an action 

Modifications: All knowledge tasks as level 6; stealth tasks as level 7
while invisible 

Combat: Supernals usually only enter combat when they wish, because they
bide their time in a phased, invisible state. But when one attacks with
the touch of its wing, it draws the life force directly out of the
target, inflicting 6 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor). 

A supernal can summon a swarm of tiny machines that resemble regular
dragonflies made of golden metal. The swarm either serves as a fashion
accessory as they crawl over the supernal’s body, or as components in a
piece of living art. 

Supernals regain 1 point of health per round (even in an airless vacuum,
which they can survive without issue), unless they’ve been damaged with
psychic attacks. They can teleport to any location they know as an
action once every ten hours. 

Supernals often carry manifest cyphers useful in combat, as well as an
artifact. 

Dragonfly swarm: level 2; flies a long distance each round; eases
physical tasks, including attacks or defense

Interaction: Although supernals only speak telepathically, peaceful
interaction with these creatures is not impossible. It’s just very
difficult, as they see most other creatures as something to be collected
and taken to some undisclosed location, for unknown reasons. 

Use: A character is followed by a supernal intent on collecting them.
Loot: A supernal usually has a few manifest cyphers, and possibly an
artifact.

GM Intrusion: The supernal grabs the character and flies up and away,
unless and until the character escapes the grab.

SYNTHETIC PERSON 5 (15)

Synthetic people have been called many things, including simply synths,
androids, robot mimics, and, depending on how they act, killer robots.
Their origins are varied. In some cases, they’re the result of corporate
research into “products” that would serve humanity as assistants and
companions, but later gained sentience. In other cases, synthetic people
are the result of a state-sponsored program to develop war machines or
automated assassins that looked like regular people. Another origin for
synthetic people is through the design of awakened (and inimical) AIs as
part of an effort to kill off all regular biological people. Now they
roam their environment looking like anyone else. Some synths try to fit
into whatever kind of society they can find. Some may not even know that
they are not human. Others are bitter, homicidal, or still retain their
programming to kill. Some of these may have even shed some or all of
their synthetic skins to reveal the alloyed mechanisms beneath. 

Motive: Varies 

Environment: Nearly anywhere, out in plain sight or disguised as a human
alone, or in gangs of three to four 

Health: 24 

Damage Inflicted: 7 points 

Armor: 2 

Movement: Long 

Modifications: Disguise and one knowledge task as level 6 

Combat: A punch from a synthetic person can break bones. In addition,
some synths (especially of the killer variety) can generate a red-hot
plasma sphere once every other round and throw it at a target within
long range. The target and all other creatures within immediate range of
the target must succeed on a Speed defense task or take 7 points of
damage. 

A synth can take a repair action and regain 10 points of health. A
synthetic person at 0 health can’t repair itself thusly, but unless the
creature is completely dismembered, one may spontaneously reanimate 1d10
hours later with 4 points of health. 

Interaction: Synthetic people that pretend to be (or think that they
are) human interact like normal people. But an enraged one or one that’s
been programmed to kill is unreasoning and fights to the end. 

Use: A group of refugees who need help turn out to include (or be
entirely made up of) synthetic people. Whether or not any of them harbor
programs that require that they kill humans is entirely up to the GM. 

Loot: One or two manifest cyphers could be salvaged from a synth’s
inactive form.

GM Intrusion: The character is blinded for one or two rounds after being
struck by the synth’s searing plasma ball.

THUNDERING BEHEMOTH 7 (21)

When life is found on other worlds, it’s sometimes large and dangerous,
such as the aptly named thundering behemoth. A thundering behemoth might
be found on any number of alien planets that feature forests and/or
swamps. Towering to treelike heights, these fearless predators are
powerful and dangerous hunters, even for those armed with advanced or
fantastic weaponry. Behemoths use color-changing frills to help them
appear like tall trees while they stand in wait for prey, as still as
mighty hardwood trunks, until they break cover and spring an ambush.
Behemoths can produce extraordinarily loud noises, sometimes simply
roaring, but often replicating the stuttering scream of an attacking
spacecraft. They use their strange “roars” to confuse, lead astray, and,
if possible, stampede prey into killing grounds such as regions of soft
sand, off cliff tops, or as often as not, into the waiting mouth of
another behemoth.

In the sci-fi setting of Numenera, similar creatures are called rumbling
dasipelts. 

Motive: Fresh meat 

Environment: Forests, alone or in a hunting group (known as a “crash”)
of two or three 

Health: 35 

Damage Inflicted: 9 points 

Armor: 2 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Disguise (as trees) as level 8 when unmoving. Deception
(sounding as if an attacking spacecraft) as level 8. Speed defense as
level 3 due to size. 

Combat: A thundering behemoth can attack a group of creatures (within an
immediate area of each other) with a single massive bite. Thanks to its
long neck, it can make that attack up to 9 m (30 feet) away. One victim
must further succeed on a Might defense task or be caught in the
creature’s maw, taking 9 additional points of damage each round until it
can escape. 

A thundering behemoth’s ability to replicate threatening noises is often
used deceptively at a distance, but the creature can use it to stun all
targets within immediate range so they lose their next turn on a failed
Might defense roll. 

Interaction: Behemoths have a complex communication system among
themselves, using their color-changing frills and modulation of the
thunder they produce. They think of humans and most other creatures as
food. 

Use: The sound of fighting spacecraft has repeatedly spooked human
colonists on an alien planet, though they have rarely seen destructive
beams or actual spacecraft. Worried that that will soon change, the
residents ask the PCs to investigate.

GM Intrusion: The character avoids being bitten but is batted away by
the behemoth’sattack, tumbling a short distance (and taking 5 points of
damage).

VACUUM FUNGUS 5 (15)

Vacuum fungus is sometimes found as a greenish ooze on the exterior of
spacecraft or space stations, growing in fine lines through the ice of
frozen moons, and infesting the center of small asteroids and near-Earth
objects (NEOs). Though able to survive in vacuum, the fungus takes on
new morphology when sufficient spores find their way into habitable
zero-G spaces. Then they fuse together and grow into a bulbous,
emerald-hued fruiting body, typically reaching about 1 m (3 feet) in
rough diameter, though individuals can grow much larger if not
discovered. Sticky and soft to the touch, they are able to grow
undetected in the dark corners of cargo holds, in ductworks, hanging
from the ceiling of unused crew quarters, and so on. 

Vacuum fungus may be proof that extra-terrestrial life exists, but that
triumph of scientific discovery may seem less important to those who
find a clump, because they are incredibly toxic to living creatures. 

Motive: Reproduction 

Environment: Anywhere in zero G, as an unreactive ooze in vacuum, or as
a fruiting body in atmosphere, alone or in a cluster of three to five 

Health: 22 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Movement: Climbs (adheres) an immediate distance each round 

Combat: A fruiting body can selectively detonate spore pods along its
surface once per round. When a pod detonates, green fluid sprays
everywhere within immediate range. Living creatures who fail a Speed
defense roll take 6 points of damage from the clinging fluid. An
affected target must also succeed on a Might defense roll. On a failure,
an affected section of flesh rapidly swells, becoming a bilious green
lump, and explodes one round later, having the same effect as a
detonating pod. 

Interaction: No real interaction with vacuum fungus is possible. 

Use: Scientists are incredibly excited to discover that the strange ooze
they’ve noticed staining the exterior of their research domes is
actually a variety of fungal life. They will likely become less excited
when they discover the large growths secretly growing in the cavity
beneath the floor of their research dome in a little-used storage
closet.

GM Intrusion: Striking the vacuum fungus clump causes one of the spore
pods to detonate immediately, even though it’s out of turn.

WHARN INTERCEPTOR 8 (24)

Wharn interceptors are void-adapted behemoths, several hundred meters in
length. It’s hypothesized that they are living battle automatons devised
by ancient ultras, though against what long-vanished enemy isn’t clear.
Now, a handful (hopefully no more) glide through the depths of space
like dormant seeds, seeming for all the galaxy like some strangely
whorled asteroid or planetesimal. Who knows how many millennia they
passed in this apparently hibernating state? But when that hibernation
ends, maybe because some ancient countdown is nearing its end, or
because an asteroid miner tried to extract a sample, they open eyes
burning with deadly energy, and flex claws of particle-beam fury. 

Wharn interceptors may be related in some fashion omworwars, so much so
that humans sometimes call the latter “wharn cogitators.” However, it’s
impossible that omworwars simply “appropriate” any wharn interceptors
they encounter. 

Motive: Defense 

Environment: Anywhere floating through the void 

Health: 53 

Damage Inflicted: 15 points 

Armor: 5 

Movement: Flies a very long distance each round; can maneuver like an
autonomous level 5 spacecraft if using extended vehicular combat rules.
FTL capable. 

Modification: Speed defense as level 3 due to size. 

Combat: Most of the time, wharns are inactive and might look like
tumbling rocks. In this state, space voyagers may be able to partly wake
one in an attempt to negotiate. However, if a wharn is damaged, or if
the passive senses deep in its body wake it for reasons of its own, it
becomes aggressive. 

A wharn’s main weapons are its claws, which can extend in an instant,
becoming exotic-matter beams able to reach a target up to a light-second
away. Unless a target is protected by some kind of force field, the 15
points of damage inflicted ignores Armor. A wharn’s eyes can pierce most
forms of camouflage, cloaking effects, and cover that is less than about
200 m (650 feet) thick. 

Interaction: In spite of their ferocious aspect and war-machine
heritage, wharn interceptors do not destroy every spacecraft (and
void-adapted creature) they come across, or even most. Indeed, sometimes
a wharn may attempt to initiate communication via various machine
channels. But what comes across are usually nonsense sounds and tones,
and sometimes mathematical formulas. 

Use: The PCs, attempting to enter an abandoned space station or
spacecraft, are distracted when a wharn attempts to destroy the very
same object.

GM Intrusion: The wharn moves unexpectedly, striking the vehicle the PCs
are traveling in, inflicting 8 points of damage to everyone on board.

WRAITH 4 (12)

Wraiths (Homo vacuus) are genetically engineered to live in the vacuum
of space by directly metabolizing high-energy charged particles abundant
in the void. Though derived from human stock, wraiths are alien in body,
sometimes concealing themselves in layers of shroud-like tissue, other
times revealing themselves as wispy, elongated things of glowing red
plasma. In some settings, wraiths are partners with humans, working in
locations where humans would find difficult. In other settings, wraiths
went their own way generations earlier, and rediscovering them would be
a first contact scenario. Alternatively, wraiths might be a threat to
humans, hating humans for having created a species forced to spend its
existence in the dark void of space.

Motive: Varies with individual or setting 

Environment: Anywhere in vacuum, though usually with access to some kind
of enriched radiation source. Environments with 1 G or higher eventually
kill wraiths. 

Health: 15 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Movement: Short when flying in zero and low G 

Modifications: Perception and stealth tasks as level 7 

Combat: Wraiths can unfold from their concealing shrouds and attack with
radioactive limbs for 6 points of Speed damage from ionizing radiation
(ignores most Armor), or if available, technological weapons. Some can
direct ionizing radiation as long-distance attacks, though doing so
costs the wraith 1 point of health. Wraiths are immune to radiation, and
attacks using radiation heal a wraith’s lost health by the amount of
damage the attack would have otherwise afflicted. Gravity of 1 G or
greater hinders all wraith actions. 

Interaction: Wraiths communicate by radio. They react to outsiders as
dictated by their place in the setting. 

Use: A distant space station stops all communication. Investigators are
dispatched to find out what happened. Once aboard, they unravel clues
that suggest wraiths may have been responsible. 

Loot: Some wraiths carry valuable items and equipment.

GM Intrusion: The attacked character must also succeed on a Might
defense, or they take an additional 3 points of ambient damage and
contract radiation sickness.

ZERO-POINT PHANTOM 3 (9)

Temporary violations of conservation of energy mean that “virtual
particles” constantly and seemingly randomly pop out of nothing, briefly
interact with normal matter, then disappear. Zero-point phantoms are
collections of such particles, taking the form of a very large, almost
spider-like entity of many legs, stalks, and arms. What they’re doing
when they’re not manifest is unknown; are they entombed in nearby
solids, phased into another dimension, or do they simply not exist until
they are called into being by some random cosmic event? Whatever the
case, zero-point phantoms seem to prefer unlit or dimly lit areas in
spacecraft and stations far from any planet, when they seem to struggle
out of solid surfaces, raising a cloud of shadow. 

Motive: Hungers for flesh 

Environment: Anywhere dark 

Health: 15 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Movement: Short; short when climbing 

Modifications: Speed defense as level 4 due to a cloud of shadows
surrounding a zero-point phantom 

Combat: A zero-point phantom attacks with needlelike leg and tentacle
tips. A victim that takes damage must succeed on a Might defense task,
or become poisoned, the effect of which is to drop them one step on the
damage track. The victim must keep fighting off the poison until they
succeed or drop three steps on the damage track; however, those who fall
to the third step on the damage track from a phantom’s poison are not
dead. They are paralyzed and can’t move for about a minute. If a phantom
isn’t otherwise occupied, it can grab a paralyzed victim and phase back
into non-existence. Most victims phased away in this fashion are never
seen again. 

Zero-point phantoms can stutter in and out of existence on their turn
once every few minutes. When they do, they return with full health. 

Interaction: Zero-point phantoms are about as intelligent as predators
like wolves. 

Use: The abandoned spacecraft is weirdly empty of any bodies whatsoever.
It’s as if everyone just disappeared. There are signs of a struggle,
though with what isn’t clear,

GM (group) Intrusion: Nearby light sources fail. Attacks and defenses
against the zero- point phantoms are hindered by two steps for
characters unable to see in the dark.

ADDITIONAL SCIENCE FICTION EQUIPMENT

In a science fiction setting, the following items (and anything else
appropriate to the setting) are usually available.

Equipment: Equipment includes apparel, armor, cybernetic implants,
personal drone assistants, and other items that, for the most part, can
be easily transported. Technically speaking, armaments are also
equipment. Unless it’s important to make a distinction, assume all
guidance regarding “equipment” also applies to armaments. But when it is
important to make a distinction, the term “armaments” is used for
equipment that is also a weapon.

Armaments: From contemporary bullet-firing pistols to fantastically
advanced handheld disintegration guns, the weapons presented in this
chapter are dedicated to those that a single character can carry and
use.

VARIABLE COST BY TECH RATING

Equipment costs assume the setting is predominantly of same tech rating
as the object’s tech rating. The price drops by one price category if
the setting tech rating is, generally speaking, greater than the
object’s tech rating.

Note, however, that inexpensive items do not become free; they remain
inexpensive.

WEAPON OPTIONS GRANTED BY TYPE OR FOCUS

When a player makes up their character, their type likely indicates that
they can choose one or more weapons of their choice. When choosing such
weapons and equipment, the following restrictions apply to that choice:

• Characters must choose weapons within, or less than, the average tech
rating of the setting. 

• Characters may not choose weapons in the exorbitant or priceless price
category.

CONTEMPORARY STYLING IN ADVANCED OR FANTASTIC SETTINGS 

Equipment listed as contemporary can often be had in hard science
fiction or fantastic genres, possibly at a lower price. Note that such
equipment available in these future worlds are not necessarily antiques
(though they could be), but rather cheaply made objects. 

EQUIPMENT POWER

For the most part, assume that equipment is either self-powered, or
easily powered by charging fields or other ubiquitous and freely
available sources. That is, unless a piece of equipment losing power
makes a good GM intrusion in a clutch situation.

CUSTOMIZING EQUIPMENT

Listing all possible armaments and equipment and their many variants
across all three tech ratings, at least in the space available, isn’t an
option. However, a representative cross section is provided. If you’re
looking for something that isn’t noted, look for something close and
adapt the listing

COMMUNICATION

LIGHTSPEED COMMUNICATION DELAYS

For ease of reference, the light delay table provides the time it takes
light from the sun to each planet in our solar system, plus a few other
notable locations. To figure light delays between two different
locations, subtract the time delay of the object closer to the sun from
the time delay of the object farther away. The difference is the light
delay between those two locations. Double times for two-way
communication

“smartacs.” 

Courier 

level 5 (15) 

Exorbitant 

Essentially a tiny rocket that can exceed human-rated Gs to “quickly”
deliver messages across planetary distances if radio (via DSM network),
laser, or even graser communication is deemed too susceptible to
interception by a third party. A courier must be launched in a
micro-gravity environment. 

Laser array

level 5 (15) 

Exorbitant A bulky piece of equipment that takes a few days to set up
and calibrate. Useful for ship-to-ship communication for “tight” beaming
information; even highly focused lasers spread out to several miles
after only traveling a few light-seconds, diminishing their usefulness.
Also doubles as a spacecraft weapon system (but all attack tasks using
it are hindered). 

Graser array

 level 5 (15) 

Exorbitant 

As laser array, but collimates gamma rays, which diverge far less
quickly than light, allowing communication between planets. Also doubles
as a spacecraft weapon system (but all attack tasks using it are
hindered).

FANTASTIC

Mind’s eye 

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

As contemporary AR glasses, but directly incorporated into the brain as
cortical implant. Incorporation grants eidetic memory, the ability to
link senses between authorized users within network range, and some
control over brain chemistry, granting an asset on all tasks the user
attempts to control or moderate their own reactions.

could provide additional information, though analysis requires several
hours or more. 

Nightvision goggles

level 3 (9) 

Expensive 

Reasonably accurate vision in complete darkness, up to 100 m (330
feet). 

Analysis apparatus 

level 4 (12) 

Exorbitant 

Any one of a number of pieces of lab equipment that takes a few days to
set up and calibrate, including chromatography columns, mass
spectrometers, calorimetry analyzers, and more. Such a piece of
equipment grants two assets to any analysis task where perception could
provide additional information, though analysis requires several hours
or more.

ADVANCED

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

Smartphone-like device customized for analysis; provides an asset for
identifying tasks. 

White noise generator 

level 5 (15) 

Expensive 

Fist-sized device that fuzzes frequencies all across the spectrum,
hindering all electronic perception and surveillance tasks within short
range by five steps. 

Lab-on-a-chip 

level 5 (15) 

Very Expensive 

Portable 15 cm (6 inch) cube with many inputs and readouts (and network
connections). Eases any research task where small-scale perception could
provide additional information by two steps, though analysis requires
about ten minutes.

manner of surveillance devices, including visual, audio, chemical, and
lab-on-a-chip functionality. Propelled by rotors in an atmosphere or
micro-thrusters in vacuum. Research drones can also be controlled
through AR glasses or smartphones to any distance communications reach. 

Tactile drone 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

As research drone, except without the suite of analysis tools, providing
only audible and visual feeds back to controller (if there is one), but
with physical options; tactile drones can accomplish routine tasks and
attempt those of level 4 or less, or allow a remote operator to attempt
more difficult tasks at a distance.

FANTASTIC

Multicorder 

level 5 (15) 

Very Expensive 

Handheld device provides two assets and one free level of Effort to any
perception, analysis, or computing task that the device’s multiple
sensors (including radio, gravimetric, chemical, visual, audio, and
others) within short range. Analysis requires only one round to
complete. 

An ability granting a free level of Effort usually must be unlocked by
the application of at least one level of Effort, in effect providing one
more level of Effort than what was paid for

Probe drone 

level 6 (18) 

Exorbitant 

More advanced version of a contemporary research drone that can be
deployed to other planets and even star systems to gather environmental
and tactical information, which is transmitted back. If forced to defend

Expensive 

Functions as medium armor (+2 Armor). 

Military body armor, light 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

Functions as medium armor (+2 Armor), encumbers as light armor. 

Military body armor

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

Functions as heavy armor (+3 Armor).

Remember, armor (lowercase a) is something you wear. Armor (capital A)
is the bonus you get. You can have only one type of armor at a time, but
you can have many sources of Armor, theoretically.

ADVANCED

Safesuit, space 

level 2 (6) 

Moderate 

Cheap, mass-produced one-size-fits-all vacuum-protection “suit”
(sometimes they look more like a bag) of thin polymer suitable for
emergency decompression events but not for long-term use. Can be put on
and sealed with one action, but any physical action taken while wearing
one is subject to automatic GM intrusions on a d20 die roll of 1 or 2.
If a roll triggers a GM intrusion, the suit tears.

Breather 

level 2 (6) 

Moderate/Expensive 

A facemask providing a day of breathable air in poisonous or low-oxy
atmospheres, or continuously for expensive breathers with recycling and
oxy extraction features. If used in a vacuum, a breather provides the
wearer three rounds of action before the full effects of vacuum begin
dropping them on the damage track. 

Exoskin, grav-assist 

level 3 (9) 

Expensive 

Powered anthropomorphic exoskeleton allows completely normal function in
high gravity environments of up to 5 G. Exoskins are related to loader
mechs. Increase the cost category by one to grant +1 Armor. 

Shipboots 

level 3 (9) 

Expensive 

Any footwear that allows variable magnetic adhesion to a surface;
cancels the hindrance to all physical actions suffered by those acting
in zero-gravity conditions. 

Pressure suit 

level 3 (9) 

Expensive 

A full-body suit similar to a space suit, but only rated for regions of
low pressure (not vacuum) such as is typically found on Mars. Some come
integrated with breathers (at double the cost). 

Exoskin, brute 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

As grav-assist exoskin, but high-tensile effectors ease all tasks
related to Might. 

Exoskin, reactive 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

As grav-assist exoskin, but integrated memory fibers ease all tasks
related to Speed. 

Space suit 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

Protects a wearer from vacuum and allows basic normal activities in
space. Requires about four rounds to put on and seal (going quicker
risks a bad seal). Provides about ten hours of atmo in a vacuum without
refurbishment. Extremely limited maneuvering thrusters provide a couple
of opportunities to correct a poorly aimed jump through zero G.
Shipboots are usually built in. 

“Atmo” is the catch-all term for oxygenated, breathable air and livable
pressure.

Stealthsuit 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

Provides two assets to stealth tasks. 

Swimsuit, hydrodynamic 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

Next-generation materials repel water, increase oxygen consumption, and
shape swimmer’s body to better swimming ideal; provides two free levels
of Effort to swimming tasks. 

Space suit, deluxe 

level 5 (15) 

Very Expensive x2 

As space suit, but deluxe and durable. A deluxe suit features built-in
recyclers granting air, water, and nutrition for about a week of
continuous use. Microthrusters allow for continuous zero-G maneuvering
over a period of ten minutes, or even more if air reserves are tapped
(which depletes them). If the suit is breached because of external
damage, self-sealing tech limits repercussions described in Taking
Damage in a Space Suit to just a round or two, assuming the breach is
not catastrophically large.

TAKING DAMAGE IN A SPACE SUIT

Taking damage while protected from the effects of vacuum in a space suit
(or safesuit) requires one additional defense roll. On a failure, the
suit breaches and begins to spew precious air, heat, and pressure into
the void. Deluxe space suits have auto-sealing functionality, repairing
the puncture within a round. But during any round a suit is leaking, all
tasks are hindered as the spray of venting atmosphere jerks or even
spins the character around. Those with less advanced suits must find
some way to seal the breach within three rounds, otherwise on the fourth
round, they are treated as if in vacuum.

ADVANCED ARMOR

Armored bodysuit 

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

Functions as medium armor (+2 Armor), encumbers as if not wearing any
armor. 

Body armor, lightweight

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

Functions as heavy armor (+3 Armor), encumbers as if wearing medium
armor. 

Paint-on impact armor 

level 5 (15) 

Expensive 

Not armor; offers +1 to Armor, applied by spraying nanosolution from
spray applicator over clothing and skin, lasts ten minutes; each
applicator depletes 1 in 1d10 uses.

Not armor; wearable device projects an offset hologram of the wearer,
providing an asset to Speed defense tasks. 

Battlesuit, deluxe 

level 6 (18) 

Exorbitant 

As battlesuit, but with armor and power assist; the battlesuit grants an
additional +1 to Armor in addition to the 3 Armor that heavy armor
usually offers, and encumbers as medium armor. Armor rating also applies
to damage that often isn’t reduced by typical armor, such as heat or
cold damage (but not Intellect damage).

FANTASTIC

Breather, vacuum 

level 3 (9) 

Expensive 

Facemask generates a variable forcefield around wearer that provides
comfortable temperature and atmo to wearer in poisonous atmospheres,
underwater, or in vacuum, for several hours, even without a space suit. 

Bounding boots 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

Gravity-assist boots provide two free levels for Effort for jumping and
running tasks. In addition, wearer can fall from any height safely if
prepared for the descent. 

Cloak, chameleon 

level 5 (15) 

Very Expensive 

Renders wearer essentially invisible save for hardly-noticeable
distortions for up to ten minutes. Provides one asset and one free level
of Effort to stealth tasks.

An ability granting a free level of Effort usually must be unlocked by
the application of at least one level of Effort, in effect providing one
more level of Effort than what was paid for.

FANTASTIC ARMOR

Force field, quick 

level 4 (12)

 Very Expensive 

Not armor; belt generates an almost transparent force field to surround
the user for up to one hour, providing +1 Armor. Once used, must be
recharged for several hours. 

Cloak, impact 

level 5 (15) 

Very Expensive 

Fashionable cloak with attached hood. If the wearer is subjected to a
physical or energy attack, the garment strategically hardens,
functioning as heavy armor (+3 Armor), and encumbering as light armor. 

Cloak, reflective 

level 6 (18) 

Very Expensive x2 As chameleon cloak, but also reflects energy attacks
back on attacker if PC succeeds on their defense task.

Battle armor 

level 6 (18) 

Exorbitant

As battlesuit, but grants an additional +3 to Armor in addition to the 3
Armor, and

encumbers as light Armor. In addition, the wearer gains +1 to their
Might Edge and +5 to

their Might Pool.

Force field, omni 

level 6 (18) 

Exorbitant

As quick force field, but permanent while active, requires no recharge
period. In addition, the wearer can tune the field so that it’s hazed
and translucent, hiding their identity, or make it fully dark so that it
emits no light (though they can see through the field normally).

Kinetic ring 

level 6 (18) 

Exorbitant

Ring reactively projects a powerful energy field to deflect or slow
projectiles, easing the

wearer’s Speed defense roll. If the projectile still hits the wearer,
the field grants +1 to Armor

against the attack.

Gun armor 

level 6 (18) 

Exorbitant x2

As battle armor, but armor includes a deployable integrated long-range
plasma weapon that inflicts 6 points of damage. It’s able to fire
autonomously, allowing the wearer to take some

other action (though if set to do so, automatic GM intrusions occur on
1–3 on a d20, and if

triggered, result in friendly fire).

level 3 (9) 

Inexpensive 

As flashlight, but radioisotope power cell allows the light to shine a
bright light up to a very long distance for arbitrary lengths of time. 

Tent, environment 

level 3 (9) 

Moderate 

As tent, but filters out poisonous atmospheres. Can be used in vacuum in
an emergency for a few hours of air, but the taut fabric is given to
tearing (GM intrusions triggered by rolling a 1 on d20 cause it to
rip). 

Repair tape roll 

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

As duct tape, but programmable matter embedded in fabric provides two
assets to all tasks related to repair using the tape and taping things
together. Each roll has about ten uses. 

Self-extending rope

expensive cost to replace after every dozen or so uses, though items
printed by the 4D printer can be recycled, extending the feedstock
supply accordingly. Many long-haul spacecraft seek to obtain a 4D
printer because having one significantly reduces the amount of material
that must otherwise be carried.

FANTASTIC

Carryall pack 

level 5 (15) 

Expensive 

As backpack, but dimensional folding allows for an arbitrary number of
objects to be stored inside, so long as they fit the carryall pack’s 60
cm (2 foot) diameter mouth. 

Gravity regulator 

level 5 (15) 

Very Expensive 

Belt-mounted device that regulates gravity to 1 G for wearer if within
zero G to 3 G. 

Molecular joiner 

level 5 (15) 

Very Expensive 

Handheld device causes the molecules of two touching physical surfaces
of up to level 8 to truly blend, forming a seamless bond stronger than
even the most advanced glue. 

Programmable suitcase 

level 6 (18) 

Exorbitant 

Large metallic suitcase composed of programmable matter that, with
instruction, can convert itself into nearly any object or piece of
equipment of an equal or lower level or price, excluding artifacts and
manifest cyphers. The replicated object can be converted back to its
base state as a separate action.

HEALTH CARE AND NUTRITION

Health care is too broad a topic to cover in depth. However, for
purposes of on-the-go amelioration of wounds and other injuries, the
following options are available. In particular, advanced tech autodocs
include any number of partly robotic healing kits or automated hospital
devices.

CONTEMPORARY

Trail rations (1 day) 

level 1 (3) 

Inexpensive 

First aid kit 

level 2 (6) 

Moderate 

Kit of bandages, antibiotics, and similar supplies; provides an asset to
healing tasks. 

Military-grade field dressing 

level 3 (9) 

Very Expensive 

Bandage with antimicrobial, analgesic, hemostatic, and temporary skin
substitute qualities that can raise a victim one step of the damage
track if damage was due to a wound.

ADVANCED

Cold sober 

level 2 (6) 

Inexpensive 

Chewable tablet that speeds the breakdown of blood alcohol while also
dissolving the toxic breakdown products of natural alcohol processing,
leaving a user sober and free of a hangover within ten minutes. 

Instabulb, coffee 

level 3 (9) 

Inexpensive 

Coin-like disc; percolates and swells when water is added, becoming a
sealed bulb filled with aromatic hot coffee. Other beverages can be had
in the same form factor, suitable for travel and drinking in zero G. 

Mega bar 

level 3 (9) 

Moderate 

As trail rations, but bar either provides enough nutrition for one day
of food or one free recovery roll. 

Serum, remedial 

level 3 (9) 

Moderate 

“Serum” is an often-used term for an ampule of artificially engineered
blood and plasma that provides some kind of benefit. Serums of all types
are generally dispensed from an autodoc, but may also be obtained as
individual units, or in packs or cases. An ampule of remedial serum
grants the user 3 points they can add to any Pool. It also has the
benefit of relieving hangover symptoms. 

Serum, space-fit 

level 4 (12) 

Moderate 

As remedial serum, but protects against the two most common dangers to
human physiology from extended trips into space and long-term exposure
to zero G and radiation, which most notably include DNA breakage from
cosmic rays and bone and muscle deterioration from microgravity. An
ampule of space-fit serum lasts for about a month.

Serum, acceleration 

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

As remedial serum, but allows user to ignore the many deleterious
physiological effects of acceleration and high-G maneuvers (of up to 15
Gs) for one hour (or of up to 20 Gs for a few minutes). Users are likely
unable to move under high G, but won’t pass out, have a stroke, cardiac
arrest, etc.—at least, not immediately. Prolonged use may still lead to
all these outcomes. 

Serum, antivenom 

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

As remedial serum, but grants a Might task eased by four steps to
withstand and clear poison from the user’s system and provides similar
poison resistance for one day. 

Sleep set 

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

A thin metallic (but comfortable, padded) headset that rests on the
temples and induces a deep (dreamless) sleep state for a specified
period, usually no more than three to six hours. Fail-safes can be set
to bring a user out of sleep if loud noises, movement, someone addresses
the sleeper, or other triggers occur. Users find themselves extremely
well rested after each use. 

Transplant, organ or limb 

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

If an autodoc or more advanced facility is available, a lost limb or
organ can be replaced. Replaced limbs eventually become equally
effective as the original, with practice. However, the mechanical (or
possibly force-grown) prosthetic limbs initially hinders all physical
tasks attempted using it for several weeks. 

Autodoc, mobile 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

Pack-sized kit that eases any healing task, or up to four free recovery
rolls. Also usually has a variety of serum types. (Each use requires a
depletion roll of 1 on a d10; if depleted, autodoc supplies are used up,
and it must be refilled as an expensive cost.) 

Hibernation pod 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

A pod large enough to contain a human, with internal mechanisms and
power able to safely put a person into a deep state of arrested
metabolism for about a hundred years, unless the program ends sooner or
the pod is opened from the exterior. Each hundred years thereafter, the
hibernating human must succeed on a Might defense task. The difficulty
begins at 1, but increases by +1 every few hundred years that pass. 

Omnichair 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

Provides user full mobility via combination of micro thrusters,
retractable wheels, and maglev levitation in all environments (from
microgravity to full gravity), often contains a variety of tools and
enhancements that grant the user assets to common tasks (possibly
including a built-in weapon system). If customized to do so for an
additional very expensive cost, can extend a fairing, enabling the
omnichair to act as a sort of space suit/miniature spacecraft at need. 

Autodoc 

level 5 (15) 

Exorbitant 

As mobile autodoc, but fixed in place (suitable for a starcraft or
station sickbay), and grants essentially unlimited recovery rolls or
serum injections to anyone who spends at least an hour immobilized on
the autodoc med table, even for the most minor of treatments.

FANTASTIC

Nano tab, general 

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

Any of a variety of pill-like concentrations of nano-scale robots
designed to activate once taken by mouth. Nano tab pills are usually
designed for health interventions, though some also provide additional
physical benefits. A general-use nano tab adds 1 to all recovery rolls
made by user for one day. 

Nano tab, rejuvenator 

level 5 (15) 

Very Expensive

As general nano tab, but refills 4 points to 1 Pool and raises user one
step on damage track. 

Stasis pod 

level 5 (15) 

Very Expensive 

As hibernation pod, but suspends time for target indefinitely, until
program ends or pod is opened. 

Nano tab, acceleration 

level 6 (18) 

Exorbitant 

As general nano tab, but permanently grants the benefits of an ampule of
acceleration serum. 

Nano tab, space-fit 

level 6 (18) 

Exorbitant 

As general nano tab, but permanently grants the benefits of an ampule of
space-fit serum. 

Nano tab, immolating 

level 7 (21) 

Priceless 

As general nano tab, but explosively distributes nano-threads deep into
the body, turning it into mostly weaponry, effectively granting five
posthuman upgrade power shifts. However, this quickly burns out the
user, who dies within a solar standard month.

ROBOTS & AI

CONTEMPORARY  
Electronic assistant 

level 2 (6) 

—/Moderate 

Anyone with a smartphone has some kind of built-in electronic assistant,
though stand-alone versions can be had. Electronic assistants are voice
activated and tie into the internet and any other connected systems,
such as lights, door locks, furnaces, music speakers, and more. 

House robot 

level 3 (9) 

Expensive 

Any number of small automated devices that can vacuum, mop, or conduct
similar routine tasks in a limited area. Includes embodied electronic
assistants with some mobility, such as Jibo. 

PackBot 

level 3 (9) 

Exorbitant 

An autonomous mobile robot that moves on treads, which can also be
remote controlled. Useful in situations where humans would be
endangered, such as bomb disposal, hazmat, search, and reconnaissance.
It can climb stairs, drive through mud, and operate in all-weather
conditions. 

Surveillance drone 

level 3 (9) 

Exorbitant 

An autonomous flying robot, which can also be remote controlled. Can
record or relay its environment to distant controllers. An upgrade into
the priceless category allows one to carry two or more self-guiding
missiles that inflict 12 points of damage and drop unprotected targets
two steps on the damage track. 

ADVANCED

Auton

 level 1 (3) 

Moderate 

The generic term “auton” refers to a smart robot, one able to exist in
the world as a full-fledged entity, though not nearly so competent as a
true AI. On the other hand, autons come very close to having
self-awareness, and some have probably achieved it. The variety of
autons is staggering, given that they can be trained in nearly any task.
Autons also come in a variety of shapes and colors, which vary based on
culture and tech level. Though most can move on treads or legs to follow
their owners as directed, some autons are housed in drone-like chassis
using either rotors or microthrusters, allowing them to fly rather than
move on the ground. Treat a basic auton as a level 1 follower, which
allows the auton modifications in one task. 

Auton, aide 

level 2 (6)

 Expensive 

Treat as a level 2 follower, which allows the auton modifications in up
to two tasks, depending on the particular aide. 

Auton, medical 

level 2 (6) 

Exorbitant 

As auton, but one modification is always healing. A medical auton also
incorporates a mobile autodoc. 

Auton, defense 

level 2 (6) 

Exorbitant 

As auton, but one modification is always Speed defense, which means when
helping to defend a target from a physical attack, the target eases the
task by two steps. A defense auton also has 3 Armor. 

Auton, military drone 

level 2 (6) 

Exorbitant 

As defense auton or warrior auton, but miniaturized and able to fly in
gravity to support owner. 

Auton, warrior 

level 2 (6) 

Exorbitant

 As auton, but one modification is always in attacks, which means when
helping a target to make an attack, the target eases the task by two
steps. However, warrior autons usually attack autonomously as level 3
entities with a ranged or melee weapon that inflicts 5 points of
damage. 

Shipmind 

level 3 (9) 

Exorbitant x2 

A shipmind is a sim AI that exists within a single spacecraft or
starship, with the ability to control many aspects of vehicle functions
as necessary to supplement a crew, or sometimes in lieu of a crew.
Shipminds each have their own simulated personality, emulating
consciousness, though in most cases, they are not actually conscious.
Having a shipmind installed on a spacecraft is immensely helpful, as it
can oversee many basic functions. A shipmind usually accomplishes tasks
at the level of the ship in which it is installed.

FANTASTIC  
Synth 

level 3 (9) 

Expensive Synths are a blend of biological and mechanical parts so
advanced that in some cases it’s impossible to tell the difference
between a living creature and a synth. They are strong AIs in physical
bodies. Other varieties of synths are constructed (or have modified
themselves) to make it obvious they are not biological. In any case,
synths are often sturdier and longer lasting than an average biological
entity. Even so, in some settings, synths are relegated to being
servitors, as if they were simple robots and autons. In other settings,
a few, some, or all humans have long ago migrated into synth bodies,
leaving their biology behind in prehistory, and becoming posthuman.
Treat as a level 3 follower, which allows the synths modifications in up
to three tasks, depending on the particular synth. At minimum, all
synths have 2 Armor and regain 1 point of lost health per round if
damaged. 

Synth, companion 

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

As synth, but treat as a level 4 follower, which allows the synths
modifications in up to four tasks. 

Synth, free

level 5 (15) 

Expensive\* 

As companion synth, but with modifications for up to five tasks. \*A
free synth usually can’t be purchased, by definition, but can be hired
on a contract basis, as an expensive cost for each week of service
required. 

Wardroid 

level 6 (18) 

Exorbitant 

As free synth, but outfitted for war, including modifications in attack
and defense. A wardroid often has many additional customizations and
abilities. 

Synth, infiltrator 

level 7 (21) 

Priceless 

As free synth, but with modifications focusing on stealth, disguise, and
tasks related to gaining entry to guarded locations for purposes of
spying or assassination. Synth infiltrators have systems that allow them
to change their apparent (or even actual) shape completely over the
course of a minute to appear as another creature or innocuous object.

RECREATION

Occasional recreation is absolutely necessary to maintain stable
relationships as well as mental stability and happiness. Characters that
never engage in recreation become gradually more unhappy and troubled,
and eventually find interaction tasks and most Intellect tasks hindered
unexpectedly.

CONTEMPORARY  
Book 

level 2 (6) 

Inexpensive 

Print, digital, or audio; once perused for at least ten minutes, grants
an asset to relaxation tasks. 

Card/tabletop/digital game 

level 2 (6)

Inexpensive/Moderate 

Suitable for passing the time and building bonds between friends and
strangers alike. 

Alcohol/drugs 

level 2 (6) 

Inexpensive/Moderate/Expensive 

Common intoxicants taken in moderation can raise spirits, easing tasks
related to social interaction while at the same time hindering tasks
related to perception and physical coordination. Excessive amounts
cancel out the benefit to social interaction and hinder all tasks by two
or more steps, making even routine tasks a challenge. Extended excessive
use can lead to addiction, a long-term disease difficult to recover
from. 

Other kinds of drugs have a different ease and hinder profile. For
example, the dose of caffeine in a cup of coffee can ease tasks related
to concentration and motivation but hinder tasks related to resisting
anxiety and irritability. On the other hand, addiction to caffeine
normally isn’t nearly as serious an addiction as alcohol or opioids.

ADVANCED

Sidekick sphere 

level 2 (6) 

Moderate 

Circuit-inscribed, and jauntily decorated, smart-material sphere about 1
m (3 feet) in diameter that rolls or jumps to stay within an immediate
distance of owner. Capable of playing music, pulsing with light,
engaging in witty conversation, and in keeping confidence. Treat the
sidekick sphere as a level 2 follower (and limited sim AI). 

Tattoo, programmable 

level 3 (9) 

Expensive 

With time and talent, someone with a programmable tattoo implant can
completely alter the designs that appear on their skin, modifying lines
and color. A small alteration requires only a few rounds, but a
full-body tattoo change, assuming any artistry at all is involved, may
take a few days to complete. 

FANTASTIC

Tattoo, living 

level 3 (9) 

Expensive 

As programmable tattoo, but images can be animated to run in a loop, or
visually respond with limited reactivity to certain audible or other
cues. Some come implanted with sim AIs for conversation and interaction.

Pleasure bit 

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

Handheld device emits magnetic induction field that activates the reward
circuit in the user’s brain, creating sudden ecstasy and joy for a
pre-set period of time. Addiction is possible, though better models have
an ebbing mode that helps put users back into their right minds
gradually.

ARMAMENTS LISTING

A selection of weapons for your sci-fi setting rated by level, price,
function, and tech level

ARMAMENT AMMUNITION & CHARGE

Weapons require ammunition (“ammo”), whether that’s rounds of a
particular caliber, energy packs, or something even more exotic. You can
handle ammo requirements for weapons in one of three ways: exact
tracking, abstracted monthly upkeep cost, or not worrying about it. 

Exact tracking means asking the character to track their available and
used rounds/shots after (and possibly during) a fight. 

Abstracted monthly upkeep cost assumes that the characters go through
ammo at an average rate, and obtaining more ammo or energy packs is
something they do in their “off-camera” time. The monthly upkeep cost
for ammo should equal about two steps less in price category than the
weapon in question. 

Or you can just not worry about keeping track of ammunition, especially
in games where gunplay isn’t common.

CONTEMPORARY

Ammo (box of 50 rounds) 

level 1 (3)

Inexpensive 

Caliber varies by specific firearm, used in most contemporary ranged
weapons

ADVANCED/FANTASTIC  
Energy pack (50 shots) 

level 1 (3)

Inexpensive 

Watt-hours (Wh) varies by specific energy weapon, used in most advanced
and fantastic ranged weapons. 

Smart rounds (box of 4 rounds) 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

A smart round can be used to make one normal attack plus up to 3
additional ricochet attacks on targets within short range of the
attacker and each other as one action. Each ricochet attack successively
increases the GM intrusion range by 2. If a GM intrusion is triggered,
the ricochet attack hits something other than what the attacker
intended, such as an important system or ally.

A character who uses a smart round on a group of foes could attempt to
attack up to 4 of them with one shot; however, the GM intrusion range on
the last ricochet attack would be 1–7 on the d20.

MELEE WEAPONS

Any weapon that a character must use by swinging or stabbing at a target
within immediate range is considered a melee weapon. Most contemporary
melee weapons rely on the strength of the wielder.

CONTEMPORARY

in a zero-oxygen environment, and that are self-propelling so firing
this assault rifle in zero or law gravity doesn’t spin wielder backward.

Foam restraint rifle 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

Thick rifle emits a short-range stream of orange liquid that foams over
a target and hardens into a body restraint that lasts for ten minutes. A
restrained victim can’t move or take actions that require movement. A
target whose level is higher than the rifle’s level can usually break
free within one or two rounds.

projects an energetic plasma-particle beam; heavy weapon (10 damage,
both hands), very long range. This rapid-fire weapon can operate in
conjunction with Spray or Arc Spray abilities. It ignores 2 points of
Armor value (except from force fields).

BLASTER WEAPONS  
Optional Blaster Rule as the Default: The advantage that blaster weapons
have over other projectile and coherent light weapons is their ability
to penetrate targets, which renders Armor less effective. This optional
rule is presented as the default rule in The Stars Are Fire to
demonstrate their superior tech level even over advanced tech weapons.

EQUIPMENT AND WEAPONS AS ARTIFACTS

Cypher System artifacts in a science fiction setting could potentially
be any one of the items presented in this chapter, if found by
characters in a less advanced setting than its tech rating. That said,
even in advanced or fantastic settings, opportunities to find especially
unusual devices are everywhere. 

Dimensional Modulator

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Marble-sized crisscross shape of unknown material 

Effect: A target within immediate range loses their dimension of breadth
(which folds into a higher dimension), rendering them as flat as paper.
The target adheres to whatever surface it was attached to, set upon, or
was standing upon, and resembles particularly realistic art. An affected
creature enters stasis. While in stasis, it is unable to take actions,
doesn’t age, and is immune to damage and effects. It remains in stasis
for about a day, until the user returns the missing dimension or the
artifact depletes. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

Metabolic Prod

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: 1 m (4 foot) metallic rod of unknown material 

Effect: When touched to a living target (possibly as an attack), the rod
injects a potent cocktail of engineered biomolecules, paralyzing the
target for up to one minute. The rod wielder may also choose one of the
following additional effects, if set before attacking. 

Aggression: The target’s aggressive tendencies are increased for one
hour, during which time the target attacks almost anything it
encounters. 

Calm: The target’s aggressive tendencies are tamped down for one hour,
during which time the target responds to attacks but never initiates
them. 

Hibernation: The target falls into hibernation, a coma-like sleep in
which their metabolism slows to a crawl. They can go months with no
additional food or water and with a fraction of the air they’d normally
need. Loud sounds, damage, persistent prodding, and the like wakes
someone in hibernation. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Probability Regulator

Level: 1d6 + 4 

Form: Fist-sized mathematically perfect solid of constant width of
unknown material 

Effect: For tasks that are usually random, the user exerts some level of
control. When picking a card, rolling a die, choosing a number, or
otherwise taking an action that skill usually plays no part in, they
attempt an Intellect task whose difficulty is determined by how unlikely
choosing correctly might be, so long as it is possible, even if
unlikely. A 50/50 coin flip is a difficulty of 1, whereas picking a
series of numbers with odds around 1 in 300,000,000 is difficulty 10. If
successful, they achieve the desired result. 

Depletion: 1 × task difficulty in 1d20

Steorraform

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Badge-sized seven-pointed star of unknown material 

Effect: If the wearer would become debilitated or die, the worn
steorraform prevents it by instantly restoring health (to a creature or
an NPC) or points to a Pool (to a player character). If the wearer would
die of old age, disease, or poison, the artifact prevents it by rolling
back the clock by a few decades, clearing the disease, or denaturing the
poison. The artifact is ineffective in preventing death when those
conditions last over several rounds or more, such as falling into lava,
the sun, a singularity, and so on. 

Depletion: 1 × number of previous uses in 1d20

WEAPONS

Artifacts that can be used as weapons, though some have other uses as
well. 

Light, Medium, and Heavy Artifact Weapons: The artifact weapons
described in this section are idiosyncratic in that they are not
described as light, medium, or heavy. If they were specifically
categorized, many characters would find that their training doesn’t
match up with a particular designation. With artifact weapons living
outside the regular weapon categories, anyone can use an artifact
weapon.

Alpha Beam Projector

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Rifle-like device of unknown material 

Effect: The device has two settings. One fires a beam of energy that
acts as propulsion and rockets the artifact away unless the user can
hold onto it as a difficulty 1 Might-based task. A user could use this
setting to fly a long distance each round, but doing so requires a
difficulty 4 Speed-based task each round to move in the direction
desired (and not plow into the ground or the side of a building). The
other setting fires a reactionless beam that can be used as a very
long-range plasma attack that inflicts damage equal to the artifact
level. The beam ignores 1 point of Armor from the target. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Carbonizer

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Pistol-like device of unknown material 

Effect: This device fires a beam that transmutes the matter of targets
within short range into powdery ash, inflicting damage equal to the
artifact level that ignores Armor from force fields and natural scales,
leather, and other organic sources. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Death Ray

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Pistol-like device of unknown material 

Effect: This device fires a beam that transmutes the matter of targets
within short range into powdery ash, inflicting damage equal to the
artifact level that ignores Armor from force fields and natural scales,
leather, and other organic sources. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Disintegration Beamer

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: Rifle-like device with two electrodelike protrusions of unknown
material 

Effect: This device fires a beam to suppress the charge of the electrons
that make up a creature or object within long range, inflicting damage
equal to twice the artifact’s level. If the attack reduces the target’s
health (or combined Pools for a PC) to below the level of the artifact,
the target instantly falls to dust. (A PC who would be disintegrated can
spend 1 XP and instead descend one step on the damage track.) 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Empathetic Ray

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: Rod-like device with very long barrel of unknown material 

Effect: This device emits an invisible beam of neural-magnetic energy as
a short-range attack that instantly reverses how a level 1 target sees
the user (turning an enemy into a friend, and vice versa) for up to one
day. The user can adjust the settings to increase the ray’s
effectiveness by making one additional depletion roll per increase in
the maximum level of the target. Thus, to alter the attitude of level 5
target (4 levels above the normal limit), the user must make five
depletion rolls. If used against a PC, an affected PC can attempt an
Intellect task to end the effect once every minute for the first few
minutes, then once every hour. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

SCIENCE FICTION ARTIFACTS

Artifacts in a science fiction game can be strange relics from an
unknown alien source or tech items that aren’t yet widely available. In
a galactic setting, for example, it’s easy to imagine that innovations
or specialized items might not have spread everywhere.

AMBER CASEMENT

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Series of short, rounded tubes and hoses about 12 inches (30 cm)
long

Effect: The device solidifies the air in a 10-foot (3 m) cube of space,
the center of which must be within short range. The air is turned into
an amberlike substance, and those trapped in it will likely suffocate or
starve.

Depletion: 1–4 in 1d6

METABOLISM BUD

Level: 1d6

Form: Organic pod, almost like a small, hemispherical bit of brain; once
grafted to a host, the host’s flesh grows over the pod until it is only
a lump

Effect: The pod grafts onto any living host (usually near the brain or
spine) and injects chemicals that boost the creature’s metabolism. This
permanently raises the host’s Speed Pool maximum by 5 points.

Depletion: —

MIND IMAGER

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Handheld device with a plastic panel screen and wires that must be
affixed to the head of a creature

Effect: This device shows a visual image of what a creature is thinking.
The affected creature need not be conscious.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

PSYCHIC CRYSTAL

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Violet crystal the size of a fist

Effect: The crystal allows the user to transmit their thoughts
telepathically at an interstellar distance. Even at that range,
communication is instantaneous. Each use allows about a minute’s worth
of communication, and the communication is entirely one way (so having
two crystals would be handy).

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

REPAIR SPHERE

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Small spherical automaton about 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter

Effect: This device comes with a small module that can be affixed to a
machine. Floating along, the sphere attempts to follow within immediate
range of the module (though it can be directed to remain where it is).
It moves a short distance each round. It can come to the module from a
range of up to 10 miles (16 km) away. If the module is attached to a
machine and that machine takes damage, the sphere moves to repair the
damage with sophisticated tools that restore 1d6 – 2 points per round
(meaning that if a 1 or 2 is rolled, no damage is repaired that round).
This requires no action on the part of the machine being repaired. The
sphere can attempt to repair a machine a number of times per day equal
to its level. The sphere must be newly activated each day.

Depletion: 1 in 1d100

VEHICLES & SPACECRAFT

Vehicle: Technically speaking, spacecraft are also vehicles. Unless it’s
important to make a distinction, assume all guidance here regarding
“vehicles” also applies to spacecraft. 

Spacecraft (and Starship): When it is important to make a distinction
from a simple vehicle restricted to the land, sea, or air of a single
planet, the term “spacecraft” is used for vehicles that travel beyond a
single planet’s atmosphere. Some spacecraft can operate both in space
and as planetary vehicles, as noted in their entries. Additionally, a
spacecraft that has FTL capability (as opposed to only interplanetary
capability within a single solar system) is referred to as a starship.

VARIABLE COST BY TECH RATING 

Vehicle costs assume the setting is predominantly of the same tech
rating as the vehicle’s tech rating. However, the price might drop by a
price category if the setting tech rating is predominantly greater than
the vehicle’s rating. 

CONTEMPORARY STYLING IN ADVANCED OR FANTASTIC SETTINGS 

As previously indicated, vehicles listed as contemporary might be found
in settings using advanced or fantastic tech, possibly at a lower price.
However, the vehicles available in these future worlds are not
(necessarily) antiques, but rather cheaply made objects, possibly with
the veneer and stylings of vehicles suitable to the setting, and
possibly the power source, too.

PRICELESS PRICE CATEGORY

A priceless item is something that even the very rich can’t afford,
requiring the resources of a nation-state, or similar entity appropriate
to the setting, to acquire or build.

FIGHTING IN A VEHICLE

If PCs are involved in combat in which they are only partly or lightly
enclosed (or not at all enclosed, as in the case of most cycles, boards,
and similar conveyances), use normal rules of combat, as modified by
vehicular movement. However, if PCs are involved in a combat where they
are completely enclosed in a vehicle with no possibility of openness to
the environment through which they can fire weapons (so that it’s not
really the characters fighting, but the vehicles), use the vehicular
combat rules from the CSR. 

If PCs are involved in space combat, see the extended vehicular combat
rules described in this book, which provide all kinds of additional
options.

DRIVERLESS VEHICLES

 If the rider, driver, or pilot activates self-driving as part of
another action, riding, driving, and piloting tasks are automatically
completed (or failed) according to the vehicle’s level, though all such
self-driving tasks are hindered. However, the pilot is free to engage in
other actions as the vehicle maneuvers to the best of its ability.

This driverless function is also available on many spacecraft, courtesy
of a shipmind, which is a sim AI that can control the ship’s functions
as necessary. Shipminds control spacecraft at the spacecraft’s level,
not their level, but are not subject to the task hindrance that more
basic driverless vehicles suffer.

LOOKING FOR MORE VEHICLE OPTIONS

 A representative cross section of vehicles is provided. If you’re
looking for something that isn’t noted, use something close and adapt
the listing.

Also note that unless a particular listing is already indicated as a
luxury or sport version, most vehicles can be obtained in a luxury or
sports package, either at the next price category up, or at double the
indicated price.

CUSTOMIZING VEHICLES  
Assuming the facilities are available, characters can pay for the
customization of their vehicle to add a weapon system, add even more
weapon systems, add superior weapon systems, or some other significant
option. In most cases, the cost for such an upgrade is very expensive to
exorbitant.

SPACECRAFT LISTING 

Most spacecraft have the capacity to reach orbit from the surface of the
planet, if not radically more advanced capabilities. All spacecraft
completely enclose their crew in a sealed cabin (or series of chambers)
with life support suitable for days, weeks, or much longer. Most
spacecraft also come with one or more spare space suits, tools, a few
spare parts, and so on. Advanced and fantastic spacecraft also have
sensors that provide enough astronavigation information to plot and fly
to their destinations. 

PCs in spacecraft can travel to other moons, planets, space stations,
and perhaps even other solar systems. PCs in spacecraft may also get
caught up in space combat (see the Extended Vehicular Combat rules) and
run across space hazards.

SPACECRAFT UPKEEP

Each month of spacecraft operation usually requires that the PCs pay for

RETROFITTING POWER AND DRIVES

Older spacecraft and starships are often retrofitted with more advanced
power sources, and more importantly, FTL drives, in order to give them
the ability to move further. The main reason to do this is that such
ships cost much less, especially if retrofitted advanced ships are
available in a fantastic setting, but even for craft within the same
tech rating. During vehicular combat, retrofitted ships are treated as
if 1 level lower than their actual level for purposes of level
comparison in combat if they are fighting FTL-capable fantastic-rated
starships.

CONTEMPORARY POWER

Solar Panels: Usually flat panels that convert sunlight to electricity,
which can be used for a variety of onboard systems, including powering
ion drives. 

RTGs: When solar panels are not an option, as is often the case for
spacecraft that operate far from the sun or on a planetary surface with
lots of dust or shadow, RTGs (radioisotope thermoelectric generators)
are good long-term power sources for electric power, which can be used
for a variety of onboard systems, including powering ion drives. The
heart of an RTG is an embedded mass of atomic isotope, such as
plutonium-238. 

CONTEMPORARY DRIVES 

Rocket: A rocket engine produces thrust by expelling reaction mass,
usually in thundering expanding white clouds from the rocket’s base
propulsion nozzle. Most contemporary spacecraft use a mix of several
rockets and fuel types. Rockets are the primary constituent of a
heavy-lift launch spacecraft. 

Ion Thruster: Ion thrusters can use solar panels or RTGs (or both) to
expel ions (or cations) to produce thrust over long periods, which
allows a spacecraft to build up speed over large periods of time. The
bleeding edge of contemporary ion thruster is VASIMR (Variable Specific
Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket), which could drastically reduce travel
times around the solar system, if perfected.

ADVANCED

ADVANCED POWER

Fusion Power: Electrical generation by using heat from nuclear fusion
reactions, requiring relatively small fuel input for much higher-power
output. Fuel sources include helium-3 (abundant on the Moon and other
locations in the solar system without an atmosphere). 

ADVANCED DRIVES 

Nuclear Plasma: Essentially, nuclear plasma drives are just very
advanced ion thrusters, the promised “perfected” version. These are
great, unless the setting has fusion drives, in which case nuclear
plasma drives may seem quaint. 

Fusion Drive: Relying on fusion power, a fusion drive is an order of
magnitude more efficient than a contemporary ion thruster. A fusion
drive does not require the creation of electricity to ionize propellent,
but instead directly uses the fusion product as an exhaust to provide
thrust.

FANTASTIC

FANTASTIC POWER 

Antimatter Power: Antimatter particles have opposite charge from their
matter counterparts, giving them potentially explosive properties when
combined, producing energy an order of magnitude more than a fusion
power system. Fuel sources include both antimatter as well as Li2 (an
atom with 2 lithium ions), important for controlled matter-antimatter
reaction so it can be harnessed for power. 

Singularity Power: Taps energy from Hawking radiation and rotational
energy of a spinning micro-black hole to generate energy an order of
magnitude more than nuclear power. Fuel source is a micro-black hole. 

Zero-Point Generator: Vacuum energy is created by normal fluctuation in
the quantum field of normal space-time. This zero-point radiation of the
vacuum provides arbitrary (possibly limitless) amounts of energy with no
fuel other than the initial resources required to build the generator. 

FANTASTIC DRIVES 

Warp Drive: A warp drive uses enormous power to distort the fabric of
space-time to create a bubble surrounding the starship. The bubble moves
by compressing space-time in front of it and expanding space-time behind
it, moving independently of the rest of the universe to achieve apparent
FTL travel. Warp drives can achieve objective speeds of up to 500 times
the speed of light at maximum power.

Hyperdrive: Similar to warp drive in some ways, but pushes the ship into
a different realm of existence, often called hyperspace, where laws of
physics differ significantly and many more dimensions are accessible,
allowing a ship to greatly surpass the speed of light before returning
to normal space. Hyperdrives can achieve objective speeds of up to 1000
times the speed of light at maximum power. 

Wormhole Drive: A wormhole drive uses enormous power to open a shortcut
between two locations in space-time and travel between those points in a
matter of seconds. Most wormhole drives rely on regions of space where
wormholes can be formed, or on previously established networks of
wormhole tunnels that the wormhole drive accesses. Which means that
while travel between two points might be almost instantaneous, travel to
and from wormhole-viable locations could greatly increase travel times.
Likewise, wormholes can normally only bridge locations up to 200 or so
light-years at a time (which means it would take about 500 jumps to
cross the Milky Way galaxy from end to end). 

Dark Drive: A dark drive (short for “dark matter quantum drive”) uses
enormous power to enable point-to-point transitions between other
locations in the galaxy (or universe) using previously unrealized
entanglement between normal matter and dark matter. However, objective
travel time is variable and somewhat arbitrary; sometimes a trip may
take minutes, other times days or months. For those aboard, relative
travel time seems constant at about four solar hours, no matter the
distance traveled, or the objective time noted by external observers.

PIONEER-ERA SPACECRAFT

Though extremely complex, pioneer-era spacecraft are not robust
vehicles. Technology allowing re-use of components is still in its
infancy in these contemporary tech spacecraft, and small problems have a
way of becoming major catastrophes if not caught and quickly dealt with.
In fact, that very complexity exacts a toll. 

Generally speaking, all tasks for operating a pioneer-era spacecraft are
hindered by two steps. Only the very well trained (or the very lucky)
should even consider trying to operate such a craft. Finally,
pioneer-era spacecraft usually don’t have weapon systems.

CONTEMPORARY

Space Capsule 

level 1 (3) 

Priceless 

Sealed capsule delivered into space by a launch vehicle or shuttle,
carries a crew of up to seven or a payload of up to 6,000 kg (13,000
pounds); once delivered into a microgravity environment, becomes a
free-flying spacecraft with limited maneuverability, though all piloting
tasks are hindered and propellant must be renewed every ten hours of
use. Capable of safely returning crew and cargo back down a gravity well
though a fiery reentry process that lands the capsule in water for
recovery by watercraft. 

Rocket, heavy-lift launch 

level 2 (6) 

Priceless 

Provides access to low orbit and beyond for a cargo of up to 45,350 kg
(100,000 pounds) through the coordinated efforts of dozens of engineers
and controllers operating and monitoring the vehicle from another
location. Extremely limited maneuverability; a detachable space capsule
allows for transfer of crew or cargo to orbiting craft or stations from
the launch vehicle after ascent. Craft is partially re-usable in that
the booster rockets autonomously return to designated pads where they
can be refurbished and refueled. 

Shuttle, launch 

level 3 (9) 

Priceless 

As heavy-lift launch vehicle, except the main craft can re-enter an
atmosphere after delivering a payload and land aerodynamically as a
fixed wing craft. Much greater maneuverability than a launch vehicle,
both in space and in the air on re-entry, though all piloting tasks are
hindered. Refurbishment means essentially rebuilding the spacecraft, and
is a process of many months and another priceless expenditure in cost.

TORPEDOS IN SPACE COMBAT

Once launched, self-guiding torpedoes engage smart-tracking systems to
zero in on their assigned targets. The torpedo accelerates at 50 or more
Gs towards its target, but at the extended distances in which many space
battles occur, it may still take several rounds for a torpedo to finally
home in on and strike (or ultimately miss) its target.

SPACECRAFT  
Advanced spacecraft have advanced propulsion technologies, allowing them
to move between planets within a single solar system, with transit times
between planets varying from days to weeks (or more, if using a less
efficient drive). Most advanced spacecraft can’t land on a planet’s
surface unless noted, requiring some secondary craft or means to
transfer crew and cargo.

ADVANCED  
Wafercraft, exploration 

level 1 (3) 

Very Expensive 

Miniaturized vehicle just large enough to contain thousands of tiny data
flecks and sensor modules, designed to accelerate to 90% the speed of
light by use of external launching laser beamed for many years. Data
wafers contain encrypted personalities (human and/or AI) capable of
gathering data on target solar systems after relative travel times of
months (but decades in objective time). 

Microcapsule 

level 2 (6) 

Very Expensive 

As space capsule, but smaller. Limited fusion drive allows movement
within a given area of space, but a microcapsule usually doesn’t have
enough fuel to move between planets. External manipulators allow the
pilot to attempt repair and construction tasks without exiting the
vehicle. 

Microcapsule, fighter (dart) 

level 1 (3) 

Very Expensive x2 

As microcapsule, but with a laser cannon weapon system capable of
targeting another craft. 

Spacecraft, racer 

level 1 (3) 

Exorbitant 

A spacecraft designed only for speed and high-G maneuvers, with space
for a single pilot (and maybe one passenger) in cradles fitted for
high-G chemical amelioration, easing all piloting tasks by two steps.
Travel times across limited interplanetary distances are halved in a
racer. Mostly used for competition or as couriers. 

Spacecraft, freighter 

level 2 (6) 

Exorbitant 

A spacecraft designed to haul cargo between planets with a crew up of to
15. Freighter ships may be quite large, or at least haul cargo that is
quite large, but these craft are bulky and not meant for quick changes
in direction or combat; all maneuvering and combat tasks are hindered.
Able to move interplanetary distances with advanced variable dynamic ion
propulsion. Can land and take off from low-gravity moons and dwarf
planets. 

Spaceplane 

level 2 (6) 

Exorbitant 

As launch shuttle (contemporary), but fulfills the promise of launch
(without boosters), operations and maneuverability in orbit, and reentry
and landing on a planetary surface, all without need for massive
refurbishment or colossal external network of controllers.

Spaceplane, combat (claw) 

level 2 (6) 

Exorbitant x2 

As spaceplane, but smaller (with room for a single pilot), fitted with
two weapon systems: a laser cannon and one torpedo battery. To move
between planets or further, a claw usually relies on a larger carrier or
more fantastic means of transport. 

Spacecraft, solar sail 

level 2 (6) 

Exorbitant 

A spacecraft designed for long-haul research expeditions around the
solar system with a crew of up to five or six, with individual pods
designed for induced hibernation during double or triple normal travel
times to extend provisions to last several years or longer. No external
power is required; solar power provides the motive force. Usually unable
to land or ascend from a planetary surface. 

Spacecraft, dragonfly class 

level 3 (9) 

Exorbitant x2 

Has the planetary launch and reentry capabilities of a spaceplane, but
is more expansive, able to house a live-in crew of about a dozen people
and over 45,350 kg (100,000 pounds) of cargo, with interplanetary (as
opposed to merely orbital) range. Life-support lasts three months before
restocking supplies is required. The ship includes a bridge, crew
quarters, engineering, an impressively large cargo bay, and a bay
containing one microcapsule. May have one weapon system. 

Spacecraft, exploration class 

level 4 (12) 

Exorbitant x3 

As dragonfly class spacecraft, but larger and able to house a crew of
about twenty-five people. Customized for exploration with extended
range-sensing capabilities and onboard biological and geological labs
(among others) for in situ analysis. 

Spacecraft, corvette class 

level 4 (12) 

Priceless 

A small warship spacecraft designed for high-G maneuvers, including use
of high-G chemical amelioration for a crew of up to fifteen people.
Features four weapon systems, including one laser cannon capable of
targeting other craft, one torpedo battery, and one superior weapon
system in the form of a gauss cannon. Able to move interplanetary
distances with advanced variable dynamic ion propulsion. Can land and
take off from lowgravity moons and dwarf planets. 

Spacecraft, destroyer class 

level 5 (15)

 Priceless As corvette spacecraft, but four times as large, allowing
four times the crew and ten weapon systems (including two superior
weapon systems). Possesses superior defenses. Often utilized to escort
larger vessels in a space fleet or battle group and defend them against
swarms of smaller attackers. Includes bays for two fireteams of six
microcapsule fighters (darts). 

Spacecraft, dreadnought 

level 5 (15) 

Priceless 

As corvette spacecraft, but ten times as large, allowing ten times the
crew and twenty weapon systems (including five superior weapon systems).
Often utilized to escort larger vessels in a space fleet or battle group
and defend them against swarms of smaller attackers. Includes bays for a
squadron of fifteen darts and a fireteam of three combat spaceplanes. 

Skyhook

level 6 (18) 

Priceless 

Heavy rotating space station orbiting a moon or planet that extends two
massive tethers opposite each other, so that one tether periodically
dips deep into the atmosphere close to the surface. At this point,
payloads are hooked to the end of the cable as the tether passes, and
are then flung into orbit by the station’s massive rotation. The skyhook
can decelerate and safely de-orbit other payloads in the same way.

Space elevator 

level 7 (21) 

Priceless 

Tether anchored to the surface of a moon or planet that extends into
space along which vehicles can travel, granting access to and from
orbital space. A counterweight space station exists at the far end of
the tether in what is essentially geostationary orbit.

STARSHIPS

Starships are spacecraft that have FTL technology, allowing them to move
between different stars, with transit times ranging from days to months,
or years in extreme cases. Starships are also often capable of planetary
landings and ascent with some retrofitting before each planetfall.

Starcraft (and other vehicles) of a higher tech rating involved in
vehicular combat with craft of a lower tech rating are treated as if two
levels higher when comparing relative levels for purposes of determining
combat effectiveness.

FANTASTIC

Dagger fighter 

level 1 (3) 

Very Expensive 

A bare-bones, single-occupant fighter with a single weapon system that
fires blasters. Dagger fighters cannot move between stars (though as
fantastic craft, can move between planets), and require a larger carrier
for FTL movement, such as a capital class starship with suitable docking
bays. 

Starship, cargo/passenger 

level 2 (6) 

Exorbitant 

A spacecraft designed to haul cargo (or passengers, or both) between
stars with a crew up of to twenty-five. Cargo starships may be
impressively massive, or at least haul cargo sections that are quite
large, but these craft are bulky and not meant for quick changes in
direction or combat; all maneuvering and combat tasks are hindered. 

Starship, solo fighter 

level 2 (6)

 Exorbitant 

A small double-occupant starship with two weapon systems that fire
blasters. Minimum size vehicle capable of FTL travel. 

Starship, general purpose 

level 3 (9) 

Exorbitant 

A small starship with room for only three to six crew plus an integrated
ship AI able to handle many routine ship functions including navigation
with FTL propulsion system. Designed for exploration of distant
locations, salvage operations, and/or to act as a tug-craft for larger
ships that need assistance. May possess a single weapon system such as a
particle cannon. 

Starship, discovery class 

level 5 (15) 

Priceless 

A large research starship with quarters for crew and staff of up to 150
or more people. Has either centrifugal artificial gravity (or in a
fantastic tech-rated setting, gravitic compensators providing shipboard
gravity control). Primarily designed as a research and discovery
vehicle, such starships also have three weapon systems, usually a couple
of blaster cannons and a torpedo battery. Highly configurable, a
discovery class ship could be converted for war with sufficient
resources, granting it superior weapons. 

Starship, warship class 

level 5 (15) 

Priceless 

A relatively small warship with gravitic compensators allowing for
extreme maneuvering for a crew of up to fifty people, easing all
piloting tasks. Six weapon stations include three blaster cannons and
three torpedo batteries. Two of these systems are superior weapons.
Includes bays for a fireteam of three dagger fighter starships.

Starship, capital class 

level 7 (21) 

Priceless 

As warship class starship, but over a hundred times larger, with room
for over a few hundred crew. Ten weapon stations include five blaster
cannons and five torpedo batteries. Four of these are superior weapons.
Includes bays for two squadrons of fifteen dagger fighter starships. 

Starship, omega class 

level 10 (30) 

Priceless 

Three times as large again as a capital class starship, an omega class
craft has over a thousand crew and over thirty weapon systems. Ten of
these are superior weapons. Combined weapon fire can deal significant
damage to a planetary surface, possibly destroying it. Includes bays for
six squadrons of thirty dagger fighter starships.

STELLAR GATE  
Stellar gates open wormholes between two fixed points at different
locations without crossing the space between. The complexity of building
a stellar gate is so extreme that such technology is often ascribed to
found portals and networks dating back to mysterious ancient ultras or
by post-singularity AIs. As might be expected, gates have a fantastic
tech rating, no matter how small.

FANTASTIC  
Gate, planetary 

level 3 (9) 

Priceless 

A free-standing ring or horizontal circular pad up to 9 m (30 feet) in
diameter in/over which a spherical event horizon forms, allowing one-way
travel to another location on the planet, orbiting moon, or orbiting
space station with similar gate structure. Once the event horizon
collapses (after several minutes up to an hour), travel back to the
original gate is possible by initiating a second event horizon, though
power reserves usually take several hours or more to build up to support
each new wormhole opening. 

Gate, interplanetary 

level 4 (12) 

Priceless 

As planetary gate, but twice as large and connects gate structures that
lie between locations within a single solar system. 

Gate, star 

level 5 (15) 

Priceless 

As planetary gate, but four times as large and connects gate structures
that lie between locations within a few thousand light-years. 

Gate, galactic 

level 6 (18) 

Priceless 

As planetary gate, but six times as large and connects gate structures
that lie between locations within a single galaxy. 

Gate, intergalactic 

level 7 (21) 

Priceless 

As planetary gate, but six times as large and connects gate structures
that lie between locations in different galaxies across the entire
breadth of the universe. 

Gate, interdimensional 

level 7 (21) 

Priceless 

As planetary gate, but connects gate structures that lie in alternate
dimensions.

SPACE-TIME VEHICLES  
Space-time vehicles allow for movement between different points in both
space and time. Such vehicles are vanishingly rare, and timelines in
which they are active tend to eventually snuff themselves out due to
accidental paradox events, limiting their availability even further. As
with stellar gates, space-time vehicles are so complex that it’s likely
they are the product of ancient ultras or post-singularity AIs, and
could be treated as artifacts with a depletion of 1 in 1d20.

FANTASTIC

Car, temporal/dimensional 

level 7 (21) 

Priceless 

As contemporary utility car or sports car, but once moving can
transition into another preset dimension or time. Enormous power
requirements require recharge period of several days between each use. 

Matrix, temporal 

level 8 (24) 

Priceless 

An arbitrarily shaped vehicle or structure, bigger on the inside than
out, that allows a pilot to travel into different locations in time and
space, though arbitrary destinations are sometimes achieved despite
apparent navigation successes by the pilot. Enormous power requirements
require recharge period of several days between each use.

VEHICLES AS ARTIFACTS

Cypher System artifacts in a science fiction setting could potentially
be any one of the vehicles presented in this chapter, if found by
characters in a less advanced setting than its tech rating. That said,
even in advanced or fantastic settings, opportunities to find especially
weird and hard-to-grok objects are everywhere. 

A couple of examples of such artifacts are presented here. 

GATE RING 

Level: 1d6 + 4 

Form: Wearable ring of unknown material 

Effect: Creates a full-sized shield that can be used as a regular shield
in combat for one character, providing an asset on Speed defense rolls
for the duration of that combat, after which it returns to its ring-like
form. In addition, the wielder can command the deployed shield to become
a functioning star gate that remains open for just one hour, leading to
a strange destination (which the wielder is potentially aware of, if
they ran sufficient analysis on the ring or otherwise gained information
about it before using the function). 

Depletion: Automatic (if gate is formed)

FRACTAL TRAVELER 

Level: 1d6 + 4 

Form: Goggle-like device of unknown material 

Effect: When worn, induces a powerful hallucinogenic state in wearer.
Hallucinations last for four hours, during which time the wearer seems
to disappear from existence. From the wearer’s perspective, they are
falling through an ever-iterating fractal realm of mind-blowing imagery,
possibly some version of hyperspace or dark energy network. At the end
of that period they return to existence, either in the same location
they left or somewhere they’ve previously visited. The images leave the
viewer shaken, but for several hours all Intellect-based tasks are
eased. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d6

STARSHIPS

Here are a few sample starship types:

|             |                   |       |                |
|-------------|-------------------|-------|----------------|
| Starship    | Level             | Crew  | Weapon Systems |
| Fighter     | 1                 | 1     | 1              |
| Interceptor | 2                 | 1     | 1              |
| Freighter   | 3 (4 for defense) | 4     | 1              |
| Frigate     | 4                 | 20    | 4              |
| Cruiser     | 4                 | 25    | 5              |
| Battleship  | 10                | 1,000 | 36             |

“Crew” indicates the minimum number of people needed to operate the
ship. Many ships can carry more passengers. “Weapon Systems” indicates
the maximum number of different enemies the ship can target at once—but
only one attack per target in any circumstance.

(Since it’s frighteningly easy to die in a space battle if your ship is
destroyed, most ships have escape pods. Even fighter craft have ejection
systems that put the pilot out into space in an environment suit. In
other words, GMs should try to give PCs a way out of immediately dying
if they get on the wrong end of a space battle.)

EFFECTS OF GRAVITY

In a hard science fiction game, variable effects of gravity can’t be
waved away by tech that simulates normal gravity on spacecraft, space
stations, and other worlds. Instead, it’s an issue people must overcome.

Short-Term Microgravity Exposure: People new to low gravity might get
space sickness. Newcomers must succeed on a difficulty 3 Might task or
suffer mild nausea for about two to four days, during which time all
their tasks are hindered. A few unlucky travelers (usually those who
roll a 1 or otherwise face a GM intrusion) are almost completely
incapacitated, and find all tasks hindered by three steps.

Long-Term Microgravity Exposure: Long-term exposure to microgravity
environments without medical interventions degrades health. How long one
spends in such conditions is directly relevant. The GM may assign
long-term penalties to PCs if the situation warrants it, though the use
of advanced space medicine, proper exercise, and recommended steroids
and other hormones can avoid these complications.

Low Gravity: Weapons that rely on weight, such as all heavy weapons,
inflict 2 fewer points of damage (dealing a minimum of 1 point).
Short-range weapons can reach to long range, and long-range weapons can
reach to very long range. Characters trained in low-gravity maneuvering
ignore the damage penalty.

High Gravity: It’s hard to make effective attacks when the pull of
gravity is very strong. Attacks (and all physical actions) made in high
gravity are hindered. Ranges in high gravity are reduced by one category
(very-long-range weapons reach only to long range, long-range weapons
reach only to short range, and  
short-range weapons reach only to immediate range). Characters trained
in high-gravity maneuvering ignore the change in difficulty but not the
range decreases.

Zero Gravity: It’s hard to maneuver in an environment without gravity.
Attacks (and all physical actions) made in zero gravity are hindered.
Short-range weapons can reach to long range, and long-range weapons can
reach to very-long range.

EFFECTS OF VACUUM

Vacuum is lethal. There’s no air to breathe, and the lack of pressure
causes havoc on an organic body. An unprotected character moves one step
down the damage track each round. However, at the point where they
should die, they instead fall unconscious and remain so for about a
minute. If they are rescued during that time, they can be revived. If
not, they die.

TRAVELING THE SOLAR SYSTEM

AND ORBITAL MECHANICS

In a hard science fiction setting, you might be interested in evoking
the reality of travel times between colonies on planets and moons in the
solar system. Even so, plotting a course between locations in the solar
system isn’t simple, because everything is always moving with respect to
everything else. You could determine exactly how long a trip would take
with some internet research. Or you could just evoke the effect of
orbital mechanics and varying accelerations on interplanetary travel.
Use the Interplanetary Travel Table to do so. For a trip between
locations not directly compared, add up the destinations in between. The
travel times assume a nuclear plasma engine of a kind already being
tested today (but better), a steady thrust toward the destination, and
an equally long and steady braking thrust over the last half of the trip
before orbit insertion. Such propulsion systems can change velocity and
sustain thrust for days at a time, which reduces bone loss, muscle
atrophy, and other long-term effects of low gravity.

Regardless, the travel times between distant locations bring home one
thing: space is big and lonely.

Science Fiction SPECIES DESCRIPTORS

In a science fiction setting, some GMs may want to offer alien species
or androids, who are mechanically different from humans, as options for
player characters. This can be accomplished by using descriptors. Two
examples are below.

ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT

You are a machine—not just a sentient machine, but a sapient one. Your
awareness might make you an exception, or there may be many like you,
depending on the setting.

Artificially intelligent characters have machine minds of one type or
another. This can involve an advanced computer brain, but it could also
be a liquid computer, a quantum computer, or a network of smart dust
particles creating an ambient intelligence. You might even have been an
organic creature whose mind was uploaded into a machine.

Your body, of course, is also a machine. Most people refer to you as a
robot or an android, although you know neither term describes you very  
well, as you are as free-willed and free-thinking  
as they are.

You gain the following characteristics:

Superintelligent: +4 to your Intellect Pool.

Artificial Body: +3 to your Might Pool and your Speed Pool.

Shell: +1 to Armor.

Limited Recovery: Resting restores points only to your Intellect Pool,
not to your Might Pool or your Speed Pool.

Mechanics, Not Medicines: Conventional healing methods, including the
vast majority of restorative devices and medicines, do not restore
points to any of your Pools. You can recover points to your Intellect
Pool only by resting, and you can recover points to your Speed and Might
Pools only through repair. The difficulty of the repair task is equal to
the number of points of damage sustained, to a maximum of 10. Repairing
your Might and Speed Pools are always two different tasks.

Machine Vulnerabilities and Invulnerabilities: Damaging effects and
other threats that rely on an organic system—poison, disease, cell
disruption, and so on—have no effect on you. Neither do beneficial drugs
or other effects. Conversely, things that normally affect only inorganic
or inanimate objects can affect you, as can effects that disrupt
machines.

Uncanny Valley: You have a hard time relating to organic beings, and
they don’t react well to you. All positive interaction tasks with such
beings are hindered by two steps.

QUINTAR

You are a quintar from the planet Quint. You are basically humanoid but
taller, thinner, and blue skinned. Your hands end in three very long
fingers. Quintar have five genders, but all quintar prefer to be
addressed as female when communicating with more binary species. Human
emotions and sexuality fascinate them, but not because they don’t have
such concepts—quintar emotions and sexuality are just very different
from those of humans. In general, quintar are more cerebral than other
species, valuing knowledge over all else.

Quint is relatively Earthlike, with slightly less gravity but a slightly
denser atmosphere.

You gain the following characteristics:

Cerebral: +4 to your Intellect Pool.

Skill: You are trained in one type of knowledge task of your choice.

Skill: Quintar fascination with human behavior eases all interaction
rolls (pleasant or not) with humans.

Difficult Rest: Quintar subtract 2 from all recovery rolls (minimum 1).

SUPERHERO RULES MODULE

Like horror, the superhero genre is really a subset of the modern genre
with extensive special considerations. In many ways, it might appear
that the Cypher System is a strange fit for superheroes. But if you
think about it, with foci like Bears a Halo of Fire and Wears a Sheen of
Ice, the Cypher System makes all genres a little bit “superhero-ish.”
Character sentences might look like the following:

Firebrand is a Brash energy projector (Adept) who Bears a Halo of Fire.

King Brick is a Tough Warrior who Performs Feats of Strength.

Dimensionar is a Mystical warlock (Adept) who Exists Partially Out of
Phase.

Dark Ronin is a Mysterious crimefighter (Explorer) who Solves Mysteries.

Speedburst is a Fast crimefighter (Explorer) who Moves Like the Wind.

And so on.

Basic CREATURES AND NPCs FOR A SUPERHERO GAME

Dog, guard: level 3, attacks and perception as level 4

Genetically enhanced bruiser: level 3, attacks as level 4; health 15; 5
points of melee damage

Ninja: level 3, stealth as level 6

Robot minion: level 4; Armor 2

Bystander: level 2

Scientist: level 2, science-related tasks as level 4

Worker: level 2; health 8

ADDITIONAL SUPERHERO EQUIPMENT

Suggested additional equipment is the same as in a modern setting. Keep
in mind, however, that for many heroes, “equipment” can be superfluous.
Where do you stash the flashlight and rope when all you’re wearing is
spandex tights?

OPTIONAL RULE: POWER SHIFTS

Superheroes can do things that other people cannot. They throw cars,
blast through brick walls, leap onto speeding trains, and cobble
together interdimensional gateways in a few hours. It’s tempting to say
that such characters are stronger, faster, or smarter, so they should
have higher Might, Speed, or Intellect Pools. However, simply bumping up
stat Pools or Edge doesn’t fully represent this dramatic increase in
power. Instead, consider using an optional rule called power shifts.

Under this rule, all superhero characters get five power shifts. Power
shifts are like permanent levels of Effort that are always active. They
don’t count toward a character’s maximum Effort use (nor do they count
as skills or assets). They simply ease tasks that fall into specific
categories, which include (but are not necessarily limited to) the
following.

Accuracy: All attack rolls

Dexterity: Movement, acrobatics, initiative, and Speed defense

Healing: One extra recovery roll per shift (each one action, all coming
before other normal recovery rolls)

Intelligence: Intellect defense rolls and all knowledge, science, and
crafting tasks

Power: Use of a specific power, including damage (3 additional points
per shift) but not attack rolls

Resilience: Might defense rolls and Armor (+1 per shift)

Single Attack: Attack rolls and damage (3 additional points per shift)

Strength: All tasks involving strength, including jumping and dealing
damage in melee or thrown attacks (3 additional points of damage per
shift) but not attack rolls

Each shift eases the task (except for shifts that affect damage or
Armor, as specified in the list above). Applying 2 shifts eases the task
by two steps, and applying 3 shifts eases the task by three steps.

A character assigns their five power shifts as desired, but most
characters should not be allowed to assign more than three to any one
category. Once the shifts are assigned, they should not change.

For example, a superstrong character might put three of their shifts
into strength and the other two into resilience. Whenever they lift
something heavy, smash through a wall, or throw an object, they ease the
task by three steps before applying Effort, skill, or assets. Thus, all
difficulties from 0 to 3 are routine for them. They smash through level
3 doors as if they don’t exist. As another example, a masked vigilante
character with a utility belt full of gadgets and great acrobatic skills
might put two shifts in dexterity, one in accuracy, one in intelligence,
and one in healing. They’re not actually superpowered, just tough and
well trained.

Some GMs will want to allow PCs to increase their power shifts. Having a
character spend 10 XP to do so would probably be appropriate. Other GMs
will want to run superhero games with PCs of greater or lesser power
(cosmic-level heroes or street-level heroes, perhaps). In such cases,
more or fewer power shifts should be granted to the PCs at the game’s
start.

SUPERPOWERED NPCs AND POWER SHIFTS

NPC superheroes and villains get power shifts, too. Most of the time,
this adds to their level. For example, Blast Star is a level 5 fiery
villain who has three power shifts. When she blasts through a level 7
iron security door, she does so easily because in this circumstance,
she’s actually level 8.

Sometimes, NPC power shifts make things harder for the PCs. For example,
Fleetfoot the level 4 speedster puts all three of her shifts in
dexterity. When she runs past a character who tries to grab her, the
difficulty to do so is increased by three steps to 7.

Typical NPC supers get three power shifts. Exceptional ones usually have
five.

REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TASKS

In superhero games, due to conventions of the genre, difficulty caps at
15 instead of 10. Difficulty 10 is labeled “impossible,” but that label
is for regular folks. For superpowered characters, “impossible” means
something different, thanks to power shifts.

Think of each difficulty above 10 as being one more step beyond
impossible. Although a GM in another genre would say there’s no chance
that a character could leap 100 feet (30 m) from one rooftop to another,
in a superhero game, that might just be difficulty 11. Picking up a city
bus isn’t something normal characters could do, but for a strong
superhero, it might be difficulty 12.

In theory, NPCs in such a game can go up to level 15 as well. Levels
above 10 represent opponents that only a superhero would consider taking
on: a robot that’s 1,000 feet (300 m) tall (level 11); Galashal, Empress
of Twelve Dimensions (level 14); or a space monster the size of the moon
(level 15).

SUPERHERO ARTIFACTS

Supervillains build doomsday devices. Ancient artifacts present a threat
to all humanity if in the wrong hands. Weird machines from alien
dimensions offer solutions to unsolvable problems. Artifacts are an
important part of superhero stories. A few examples are below.

DOCTOR DREAD’S TIME PORTAL

Level: 9

The archetypes suggest how to assign your power shifts. This is an
important aspect of designing your hero because power shifts are what
make your characters exceptional in a “supers” way. Superheroes are
known for being faster, tougher, stronger, or smarter than regular
people, and that sort of comparison isn’t always part of the abilities
you get from your type or focus. A regular person might be very skilled
at martial arts, but a superhero martial artist might punch through an
iron door, dodge a burst of bullets from a machine gun at close range,
or quickly recover from a mortal wound, all thanks to power shifts. This
part of each archetype writeup assumes your hero starts with five power
shifts, but most archetype descriptions give only two or three
suggestions, allowing you some flexibility to customize your superhero.
For example, a master athlete with two power shifts in healing is a very
different character than one with two power shifts in resilience.

In some cases, you might need to tinker with the aesthetics of the
abilities described in the character options to make them fit your
character. 

POWER SOURCE  
As you’re figuring out what type, descriptor, focus, and power shifts
you want for

your character, think about how you got your powers. Are you a mutant,
born with special abilities? Do you have a high-tech costume with
built-in nanotechnology? Are you a sorcerer, or maybe a psychic? The
source of your powers is character flavor—for example, there’s no game
mechanics difference between the mental powers of an alien member of a
telepathic species, a human character who built a brain-augmenting
helmet, or a faerie character from the starlight dimension who knows
mind-magic. All three of those characters could have the same type,
focus, descriptor, and power shifts, but they’d be very different people
and have very different reasons for being a part of the RPG campaign.

If you can’t decide how you got your powers, or if you like leaving some
things up to chance, try rolling once or twice on the Power Origin table
and pick the result that you like better, or combine the two into
something weird and unique.

Remember that you can permanently increase the range of one of your
abilities with the increased range power shift.

STARTING JUST PAST TIER 1

An interesting option for a GM starting a superhero campaign is to
immediately give each PC 4 XP, which they must spend on a special
advancement option to gain another type ability. It’s another way (along
with power shifts) to make new superhero PCs feel a cut above player
characters in other genres—and gives players a little more wiggle room
in building the character they want to play.

RANDOM SUPERPOWERS

The following table has a broad selection of powers (or in some cases,
sets of related powers). Players who are stuck for ideas about their
superhero can roll once or twice on the table for inspiration; use the
Example column for a suggested game example of that kind of power,
whether that’s a power shift, a hero archetype, a focus, or a specific
special ability (of course, these suggestions aren’t the only way to
achieve that power).

The GM can also use this table to come up with random abilities for
supervillains. However, there is much more leeway in designing NPC
abilities, so the Example column is more for suggesting game mechanics
than abilities to choose.

SUPERHERO CHARACTER OPTIONS 

DESCRIPTORS  
This section presents new descriptors meant specifically for a superhero
game.

AMAZING

You have a knack for surprising people— performing impossible athletic
feats, sneaking up on someone who’s alert, or instantly reacting to an
ambush. You like to make use of these talents to enhance (or
rehabilitate) your reputation as a hero prone to spectacular rescues,
defeating foes way above your league, and arriving just in time to save
the day. Ironically,

in your normal daily life, you’re a little awkward and overlooked.

You gain the following characteristics:

Exceptional: +2 to your Speed Pool, and 2 additional points to divide
among your stat Pools.

Skill: You’re trained in initiative and stealth tasks.

Self-Hype: When you apply a level of Effort to a task, you get a free
level of Effort. You can do this one time, although the ability is
renewed each time you make a one-hour or ten-hour recovery roll.

Inability: Your sudden appearances are startling to regular people.
Positive social reactions are hindered (villains and other superheroes
aren’t affected by this).

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in
the first adventure.

1\. You got in a bit over your head, but another PC’s coincidental
arrival gave you just the distraction you needed.

2\. You were tailing someone the other PCs were following and decided to
drop in.

3\. You saw that the other PCs were in a fight and chose to help them
out.

4\. You had a hunch that something big was about to go down.

INCREDIBLE

You’re misunderstood, and you might not even think of yourself as a
hero, but somehow you keep ending up in situations where your abilities
are just what’s needed to prevent disaster. Maybe good luck cancels out
just enough of being cursed to count as a win. You’ve saved innocent
lives, defeated some really bad people, and perhaps even cheated death a
couple of times. Half the time you don’t even know how you did it, but
you succeeded at the impossible . . . often with a lot of collateral
damage. When you hear police sirens, it’s time to leave, but you know
that trouble will find you eventually—and you’ll be ready to smash it.

Strong: +2 to your Might Pool, and 2 additional points to divide among
your stat Pools.

Skill: You’re trained in breaking things. Skill: You’re trained in all
jumping tasks. Inability: Your destructive reputation or some other
reluctance to communicate makes people distrust you. Any task involving
social interaction is hindered.

Incredible Action: You can choose to automatically succeed on one task
without rolling, as long as the task’s difficulty is no higher than 6.
When you do so, however, you also trigger a GM intrusion as if you had
rolled a 1. The intrusion doesn’t invalidate the success, but it
probably qualifies it in some fashion. You can do this one time,
although the ability renews each time you make a ten-hour recovery roll.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in
the first adventure.

1\. One of the other PCs sensed your decent heart and decided to
befriend you.

2\. You literally crashed through a wall and ended up in the middle of
the other PCs.

3\. One of the other PCs reminds you of someone from your past.

4\. You were feeling lonely and took a risk talking to someone, and so
far it’s paying off

MIGHTY

You have a very impressive physique. Your strength, power, and very
importance

are superior. Whether you’re truly the mightiest may be up for debate
(and you may have a friendly rivalry about this with other superheroes),
but there is no question that you are exceptional. These things make you
confident, but you know that you have these physical gifts in order to
perform heroic deeds, and unseemly conduct is beneath you.

Very Powerful: +4 to your Might Pool.

Skill: You’re trained in all actions involving lifting and throwing
things.

Skill: You’re trained in Might defense tasks.

Healthy: Add 1 to the points you regain when you make a recovery roll.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in
the first adventure.

1\. You joined the other PCs because they would fail without your
strength.

2\. You believe this endeavor will earn you a lot of valor.

3\. Another PC asked—rightly—for your help.

4\. An authority figure told you to do this to show you the value of
humility.

SENSATIONAL

The public and the press like you. Maybe you’re photogenic, or you’re
inherently nice, or you have really good luck with journalists. Whatever
the cause of it, you’re the darling of the media, and whenever you’re
seen in public, you generate a lot of positive interest and excitement.
(If you don’t have a secret identity, this attention probably also
carries over to your day job, which is a mixed blessing.) People know
that you’re a hero and that they can count on you to do the right
thing—fighting crime, battling injustice, punching evil robots, that
kind of stuff. Sometimes being in the public eye so much can be wearying
or even a burden, but you know how to use your reputation to set a good
example and make the world a better place.

You gain the following characteristics:

Versatile: You get 4 additional points to divide among your stat Pools.

Skill: You’re trained in positive social interactions.

Skill: You’re trained in one skill relating to your current or past
career, such as computers, journalism, law, machinery, or medicine.

Popular: The GM can introduce a GM intrusion on you, based on your fame
and the public’s perception of you, without awarding you any XP (as if
you had rolled a 1 on a d20 roll). However, if this happens, 50 percent
of the time, your reputation works to your advantage. Rather than
hurting you (much), it helps you, or it hurts your enemies. You get
spotted by a guard, but they’re dumbstruck for a moment because you’re
even more impressive in person than you are on TV. You attract a crowd
of fans, but they slow down the fleeing villain you’re trying to catch.
A photographer pesters you for a photo and a quote, but their camera
catches something interesting in the background. You and the GM should
work together to determine the details. If the GM wishes, they can use
GM intrusions based on your fame normally (awarding XP).

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in
the first adventure.

1\. You’re related to one of the other superhero PCs, and decided to
help out because of family.

2\. The other PCs relied on your positive reputation to untangle them
from a public relations problem, and they invited you along out of
gratitude.

3\. The media specifically called you out to fix this problem.

4\. A supervillain chose to make a scene in the hopes of drawing you
out.

UNCANNY

There’s something unusual about you, and it makes other people a little
uncomfortable. You know you’re exceptional—gifted, even—and being a bit
odd doesn’t make you any less of a person. This uncanny element is a
part of you, in your blood, in your DNA. You can’t help it, but you
won’t apologize for it. You feel comfortable around other people with
similar strangeness, people who’ve experienced the same prejudice that
you have; these shared experiences mean they’re your family, perhaps the
only family you’ve got.

You gain the following characteristics:

Exceptional: +2 to your Might Pool and +2 to your Speed Pool.

Distinctive Physical Quirk: You have

an unusual physical aspect. Depending on the setting, this can vary
greatly; it might be something external and obvious, such as an odd
smell or blue hair, or internal and hidden, like having blood type
“omega.” Whatever it is, your quirk draws a lot of attention when it’s
discovered.

A Sense for the Weird: Sometimes—at the GM’s discretion—an event or
person that seems related to your uncanny nature attracts your
attention. You can sense it from afar, and if you get within long range
of it, you can sense whether it is overtly dangerous or not.

Skill: You’re trained in either perception tasks or stealth tasks.

Skill: You’re trained in one kind of knowledge related to your quirk,
such as olfactory science, mutations, or hematology.

Inability: People find you unnerving. All tasks relating to pleasant
social interaction are hindered. (Other people who are unusual like you
aren’t affected by this.)

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in
the first adventure.

1\. You felt the objective was someone like you, so you got involved.

2\. Whether the other PCs realize it or not, their mission has to do
with your field of knowledge, so you got involved.

3\. As an expert in an unusual kind of knowledge, you were specifically
recruited by the other PCs.

4\. You believe one of the other PCs may be uncanny or is related to
someone who is.

If the superhero setting has a specific gene or genes responsible for
mutant superpowers, Uncanny characters have that gene (perhaps even
multiple copies) and can sense others who have it

POWER SHIFTS  
Power shifts are an optional rule in the Cypher System Rulebook that
represent many of the exceptional things that superheroes can do, like
throwing cars, blasting through brick walls, leaping onto speeding
trains, and cobbling together interdimensional gateway devices in a few
hours.

A typical superhero PC gets five power shifts. Power shifts are like
permanent free levels of Effort that are always active. They don’t count
toward a character’s maximum Effort use (nor do they count as skills or
assets). They simply ease tasks that fall into specific categories,
which include (but are not necessarily limited to) the following.

Accuracy: All attack rolls.

Dexterity: Movement, acrobatics, initiative, and Speed defense.

Flight: The character can fly a short distance each round; each
additional shift increases this speed (whether the flight comes from a
power shift or a character ability) by one range category (long for two
shifts, very long for three shifts).

Healing: One extra (one-action) recovery roll per day.

Increased Range: Increases the range of one ability or attack. A
touch-range ability (such as Shock) increases to short range, a
short-range ability increases to long range, and a long-range ability
increases to very long range.

Intelligence: Intellect defense rolls and all knowledge, science, and
crafting tasks.

Power: Effects of one specific character ability, including damage for
that ability (+3 points) if appropriate, but not attack rolls with that
ability.

Prodigy: Give up a lower-tier ability to get a higher-tier ability

Resilience: Might defense rolls and Armor (+1).

Savant: Two specific skills (other than attacks, defenses, or a special
ability), such as history, perception, or persuasion.

Single Attack: Attack rolls and damage (+3 points) for one specific kind
of attack, such as pistols, kicks, or Thrust.

Strength: All tasks involving strength, including jumping and dealing
damage with melee or thrown attacks (+3 points), but not attack rolls.

For power shifts that affect tasks, each shift eases the task. Applying
two shifts eases the task by two steps, and applying three shifts eases
the task by three steps.

A character assigns their five power shifts as desired, but most
characters should not be allowed to assign more than three to any one
category. Once the shifts are assigned, they should not change (however,
researching an experimental procedure to change a character’s power
shifts could be the culmination of a character arc such as Uncover a
Secret).

PRODIGY POWER SHIFTS

Some superhero character concepts are about breaking the normal power
level for a hero. In most cases, you can do this using power shifts. For
example, if you want your strong hero to be really strong, put one or
more power shifts into strength. If you want your archer character to be
really good at shooting arrows, put a power shift into single attack
(bows). If you want your speedster hero to be really fast, put a power
shift into power (Fleet of Foot). And so on.

But what if you want your character to be a swashbuckling teleporter who
blinks all over the battlefield? There’s no low-tier teleportation
ability, so you can’t be a teleporter as a tier 1 character, and the
character concept isn’t nearly as fun if you have to wait until tier 4
before you can learn a teleportation ability (like Short Teleportation).

This is where you can (with the GM’s approval) use a power shift for the
prodigy option. Prodigy lets you give up one of your lower-tier
abilities for a higher-tier ability

that matches your character concept. For example, if your swashbuckling
teleporter is a Graceful Explorer who Fights With Panache, you could
give up one of your tier 1 Explorer abilities (so you’d only have three
instead of four) or give up your tier 1 focus ability, Fights With
Panache, and instead select the tier 4 ability Short Teleportation.

Choosing prodigy as a power shift is an interesting trade-off for your
character; you end up with a powerful ability that you couldn’t get
otherwise, but at the cost of a power shift (which the other characters
are probably using to add to their skills, damage, or defenses). Keep in
mind that higher-tier abilities tend to cost more Pool points
(especially because your Edge as a low-tier character is less than that
of a higher-tier character), so you’ll weaken yourself if you use that
ability often—which might be a good reason to allocate more points to
that stat Pool, or assign a power shift to healing so you have more
opportunities per day to recover Pool points.

Theoretically, you could put two power shifts in prodigy for the same
ability, allowing you to select a high-tier ability. However, there are
two reasons not to do this. First, those high-tier abilities usually
have even higher costs, which limits how often you can use them. Second,
if you start out with the best version of that ability, there’s no room
to grow. It’s fun when your character impresses other superheroes by
improving an ability, and it’s really handy when your nemesis
supervillain underestimates you based on your old limitations. So unless
the GM wants every superhero PC to start with one top-tier ability, give
yourself room to grow and use prodigy only to get a mid-tier ability.

GAINING MORE POWER SHIFTS  
Some GMs will want to allow PCs to increase their power shifts. Having a
character spend 10 XP to do so would probably be appropriate. Other GMs
will want to run superhero games with PCs of greater or lesser power
(cosmic-level heroes or street-level heroes, perhaps). In such cases,
the GM should grant the PCs more or fewer power shifts at the game’s
start.

POWER STUNTS  
A power stunt is pushing a superpower beyond its normal limits or using
it to do something it normally can’t do. Examples:

• A lightning-blaster hero shooting their electricity farther than
normal

• A fire-creating hero absorbing fire from a burning building

• A telepathic hero communicating with or understanding a machine

• A teleporter hero traveling to another dimension

• An illusionist hero negating an opponent’s invisibility

The Cypher System Rulebook explains modifying abilities on the fly,
describing

a method of altering the range, area, or other aspects of an
Intellect-based ability by spending more Intellect points. In a
superhero game, these modifications aren’t limited to Intellect-based
abilities—it’s reasonable that a strong hero could affect a larger area
with Golem Stomp or an agile hero could disarm more than one opponent
using Advantage to Disadvantage. The cost for making these changes works
just like modifying an Intellect-based ability. The additional cost uses
the same Pool as the ability’s normal cost; if an ability doesn’t have a
cost, the GM should choose an appropriate ability for the points to come
from.

• Increasing range costs 1 Pool point per range step increased
(immediate to short, short to long, long to very long).

• Increasing duration costs 1 Pool point for one step (one minute to ten
minutes, ten minutes to an hour). Durations cannot be increased more
than one step in this way. Abilities that last for only an action or a
round (such as an Onslaught attack) cannot have their duration
increased.

Abilities that don’t have a Pool cost, like Eyes Adjusted, can be
modified as well. If modifying the range or duration, the GM decides
what Pool the point cost is paid from. However, most abilities like this
don’t have ranges or durations, so modifying them requires a difficult,
formidable, or impossible task roll.

Modifying the area or other aspects of an ability is more difficult.
Instead

of increasing the Pool point cost, the character decides how they want
to modify their ability, and the GM sets a difficulty of the task to
successfully modify it, according to the following guidelines:

Difficult (4): Something within the spirit and general idea of the
ability, using a self- only ability on another character, or using a
single-target ability in a weakened form on two targets. Examples: Using
a self-only ability like Hover to give another creature the power to
fly. Using Teleportation to go to another dimension instead of somewhere
in the same dimension. Splitting Frost Touch or Onslaught into hindered
attacks against two opponents.

Formidable (7): Something similar to the description or intent of the
ability, but changing its nature, or having a single-target ability
affect an area. Examples: Using Hover to make an opponent crash into the
ceiling. Using Shroud of Flame to absorb fire. Using Telepathic to talk
to a machine or Machine Telepathy to talk to a living person.

Impossible (10): An effect that has nothing to do with the ability’s
description or intent. Examples: Using Hover to blast an opponent with
fire. Using Foil Danger to copy an opponent’s attack. Using an attack
like Thunder Beam to heal someone.

Of course, if the altered ability is an attack, the hero still needs to
make a successful attack roll against their target— just because the
character found a way to use Hover as an attack doesn’t mean the attack
automatically hits. The attack task for the altered ability uses the
normal difficulty for attacking that target. For example, if Hammermind
wants to split her Onslaught so she can attack two level 2 robots, first
she has to succeed at the difficulty 4 task to split the attack, then
she can make the two (hindered) level 2 attack rolls against the robots.

Just like in any aspect of the game, other factors might ease or hinder
the hero’s attempt to perform the stunt. For example, if the hero
Firelash is trying a stunt to use his Shroud of Flame to absorb a fire
attack from his evil sister Swordblaze, the GM might decide that the
similarities in their flame powers mean that Firelash’s attempt is
eased. But if the illusionist hero Hologrim is trying a power stunt to
reveal where his invisible archenemy Death Ghost is hiding, the GM might
feel that the villain’s magical invisibility is especially difficult for
Hologrim’s technology-based illusions to counter, so the hero’s task is
hindered. The GM can also introduce power boost cyphers that ease the
power stunt task, or present the heroes with temporary effects that ease
or hinder power stunt tasks, like a virus that erratically amplifies
mutant genes, or a burst of energy from an alien artifact that reacts
with a robot hero’s power core.

If a hero tries a particular stunt in more than one session, the GM
doesn’t need to give the task the same difficulty every time; the
circumstances of each attempt are never quite the same. Perhaps this
supervillain’s fire is a little hotter or cooler than the one the hero
tried to absorb last time. Or the spaces between the dimensions are
thinner or thicker right now, making it harder to teleport between them.
The position of two opponents or the shape of a room might be different
than the last time the hero tried splitting an attack power across
multiple targets. In other words, the GM doesn’t have to remember that
the last time the hero tried this stunt it was difficulty 7, so it has
to be difficulty 7 this time; just look at the current circumstances and
make a decision based on that. In fact, this is part of the reason why
the difficulties are three levels apart; the GM is more likely to be
consistent at rating something as difficult, formidable, or impossible
than deciding whether it’s a level 6 or level 7 task.

PERMANENT POWER STUNTS

Once a character has successfully performed the same difficult,
formidable, or impossible power stunt a few times, they might want to
make it a permanent part of their repertoire of abilities. By spending 2
XP, the character gains the ability to perform that power stunt whenever
they want, with no need for a power stunt task. The GM decides how many
times the character has to get the stunt right before they can spend XP
to learn it. Three successful attempts over at least three separate
sessions is a reasonable guideline, plus some downtime between game
sessions to represent mastering this variant.

Learning a power stunt does not count as a step in character
advancement.

Learning how to do a formidable or impossible power stunt might be the
reason to take a character arc like New Discovery, Transformation, or
Uncover a Secret.

REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TASKS

The Cypher System Rulebook gives a few examples of how, in the superhero
genre, having power shifts means that a difficulty 10 task is not
impossible. Superheroes deal with planetary threats like giant robots,
multidimensional sorcerers, and world-sized monsters, and for this sort
of campaign, difficulties up to 15 are possible. This section presents
more details and examples of tasks, threats, and creatures of difficulty
11 to 15.

FEATS OF STRENGTH

Use the following table to estimate the difficulty of various incredible
feats of physical strength.

| Difficulty | Lifting Task                                                                                       |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 4          | Lift a 150-pound (68 kg) object                                                                    |
| 9          | Lift a 400-pound (180 kg) object                                                                   |
| 10         | Lift a 1-ton (1 tonne) car or traffic copter                                                       |
| 11         | Lift a 5-ton (4.5 tonne) ambulance, private jet, elephant, or Tyrannosaurus rex                    |
| 12         | Lift a 10-ton (9 tonne) school bus, combat helicopter, triceratops, or 5-foot boulder              |
| 13         | Lift a 20-ton (18 tonne) fire truck, mobile home, fighter jet, Apatosaurus, or light military tank |
| 14         | Lift a 40-ton (36 tonne) humpback whale or loaded tractor-trailer                                  |
| 15         | Lift an 80-ton (72 tonne) space shuttle, single-story house, passenger train car, or military tank |

| Task Circumstances                                               | Difficulty  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Lifting the object as high as the character can reach            | +0          |
| Lifting the object only partway off the ground                   | -1          |
| Asset (lever, jack, etc.)                                        | -1 or -2    |
| Help from another character (asset)                              | -1 or -2    |
| Large character (double human size)                              | -1\*        |
| Carrying an object an immediate distance                         | +0          |
| Carrying an object a short distance                              | +1          |
| Pushing or pulling (not lifting) an object an immediate distance | -1          |
| Pushing or pulling (not lifting) an object a short distance      | +0          |
| Pushed or pulled object can roll or slide very easily            | -1          |
| Pushed or pulled object is buoyant and moving through water      | -1          |

\*Each additional doubling of the character’s size eases the task by
another step.

Some character abilities are able to move heavy things, often more
easily than brute physical strength can. If a superhero wants to push
the limits of what those abilities can do, the GM can compare the
baseline effects of those abilities to the Feats of Strength table to
determine the comparable difficulty of the task, and modify the
character’s roll to succeed.

FEATS OF SPEED  
A character can move a short distance (50 feet \[15 m\]) as their entire
action as a routine task (difficulty 0, no roll needed). This is
basically a jog or a hustle, faster than a walk

but not an all-out run. A character can try to run a long distance (100
feet \[30 m\]) as their entire action, but they must succeed at a
difficulty 4 Speed task to complete the movement; failure means they
trip, stumble, slip, or fall down at some point during the move and
stop.

Of course, superheroes aren’t normal people—they’re exceptional, and
some can run as fast as Olympic athletes, or much faster. For a
character trying to run more than a long distance as their entire
action, use the following table to determine the difficulty for the
task. Failing this roll is just like failing the basic running roll
described above.

TREMENDOUS LEAPS

Some—but not all—strong superheroes can easily leap dozens or hundreds
of feet, well beyond what’s possible with the jumping rules (running a
short distance and jumping 30 feet \[9 m\] is a difficulty 10 task).
Characters who want to jump huge distances like that should take the
Amazing Leap ability, allowing them to jump a long distance or more.

All characters with at least one power shift in strength get the benefit
of a free level of Effort for each strength shift. This effectively
increases their standing jump distance by 1 foot (30 cm) per shift and
their running jump distance by 2 feet (60 cm) per shift, which is
impressive compared to a normal person, but not phenomenal.

To make superhero character jumps a bit more exciting, the GM can
implement an optional rule in which strength shifts count double for
free levels of Effort when jumping. For example, a character with five
strength shifts would get ten free levels of Effort on jump tasks
instead of five. This allows them to do a 15-foot (4.5 m) standing jump
as a difficulty 1 task (base difficulty 11, eased by 5 × 2 steps) and a
40-foot (12 m) running jump as a difficulty 5 task (base difficulty 15,
eased by 5 × 2 steps), which seems more appropriate for a character
strong enough to lift a car over their head.

POWERFUL CREATURES  
Superheroes don’t just stop bank robbers and fight
supervillains—sometimes they face giant robots, alien space monsters, or
so-called gods. GMs can use the following examples to estimate the level
and challenges for such threats.

| Level | Example                                                                        |

| 10    | Kaiju 300 feet (90 m) tall                                                     |
| 11    | Robot 1,000 feet (300 m) tall                                                  |
| 12    | Vampire blood god                                                              |
| 13    | Legendary monster\*                                                            |
| 14    | Archangel, demon prince, typical god or goddess\*\*, multidimensional sorcerer |
| 15    | Moon-sized space monster, pantheon leader\*\*\*                                |

\* A primordial monster (such as Echidna or Typhon) or a powerful
creature associated with the end of the world (such as Jörmungandr or
Fenris).

\*\* A powerful, perhaps immortal entity (such as Ares or Loki) that has
been worshipped or feared as a god by humans or similar creatures.

\*\*\* A god or goddess (such as Odin or Zeus) who is the ruler of a
group of deities.

MODIFYING HIGH-TECH DEVICES

It’s common for technically savvy superheroes to fiddle with machines to
make them work better or do something different. Sometimes the object in
question is their own gear, but it’s just as likely to be something they
took from a defeated supervillain or found on an alien spaceship.

A character who expects to modify many devices should consider learning
abilities such as Innovator, Jury-Rig, Modify Artifact Power, Modify
Device, and Quick Work. A character who only wants to dabble in this
sort of activity can do so, but it takes longer and is less efficient.

Small modifications are things like changing a device’s target, range,
or duration. “Small” is subjective and up to the GM, but generally, it
means adding another target (although for some high-level devices,
adding a target isn’t a small change), increasing the range by one step
(immediate to short, short to long, long to very long), or increasing
the duration by one step (one minute to one hour, one hour to ten
hours). The task difficulty for making a small modification is generally
equal to the device’s level minus 1, which also determines how much time
it takes to complete the modifications. 

Big changes are modifying a laser rifle to shoot cold or electricity,
turning a communication device into a telepathic shield, or turning a
jetpack into a force field device. These modifications are like repairs;
they use the device’s level for the difficulty and creation time, but
take half as long as the time listed. 

A character modifying their own device eases the task. This applies
whether the character built the device themselves or they’ve been
repairing and tinkering with it long enough that they fully understand
its workings.

Regardless of whether the change is big or small, failing the
modification task means the character wastes the full amount of time
spent attempting the modification, and uses up materials equal to the
device’s level minus 2, but they can try again. If they fail with a roll
of a natural 1, it’s likely that the free GM intrusion means the device
is ruined (but perhaps could be salvaged for materials).

Modification GM intrusions: The device gains a high depletion rate,
needs to be recharged after each use, or develops a side effect such as
overheating (inflicting damage to the user) or creating a thunderous
noise.

Modifying a device is similar to using a power stunt to alter a
character ability. If a character wants to make a permanent change to
one of their technology-based abilities, the GM should treat that more
like a permanent power stunt—costing XP—than a modification.

Modifying the appearance of an item is just a cosmetic change and should
take only a few hours at most for a typical handheld or worn item like a
weapon, helmet, or boots. Changing

the appearance of a spacesuit or full-body mechanized armor might take
eight to twenty hours of work, depending on the extent of the changes.

FASTER CRAFTING IN A HIGH-TECH SETTING  
In some superhero campaigns, crafting technology is so advanced that
objects are designed virtually, with holograms, or with a mind-machine
interface, and they are constructed by advanced 3D printers or clouds of
nanobots. Under these conditions, the GM should ease

the assessed difficulty to determine the crafting time by three or four
steps, with the crafter needing to be present for only about the first
quarter of that time and the “helpers” taking care of the rest.

CYPHERS AND ARTIFACTS

In a superhero campaign, there’s a fine line between cyphers (one-use
items or abilities awarded by the GM), artifacts, character abilities
(which may cost Pool points to use), and other equipment (which has none
of those criteria). The GM should keep in mind that it’s good from a
story point of view to let characters have equipment they need to deal
more effectively with foes that might otherwise be too potent.

SPECIAL EQUIPMENT

Sometimes a group of superheroes needs special equipment so they can
participate in an encounter or advance the story. For example,
characters who must get to an underwater base will need air tanks or a
water-breathing device, and those going on a short trip into space will
need a vehicle and spacesuits. This sort of item doesn’t have to be a
cypher (which counts against a character’s cypher limit) or an artifact
(which has a depletion chance)—it can just be equipment. If a player
suggests a suitable piece of equipment they can buy (such as scuba
gear), or a gadgeteer or inventor character offers to build something to
do the job, the GM should let them do it and handwave most of the
details because they’re being creative and overcoming obstacles to move
the story forward. In other words, don’t assume that every piece of
weird equipment needs to be a cypher or artifact; things that allow the
adventure to happen shouldn’t cost the characters much, or maybe not
anything at all. And if the players take too much advantage of this
leeway, the GM always has the option to use an intrusion to complicate
an encounter.

POWER BOOST CYPHERS 

This section introduces two new power boost cyphers, and consolidates
the two efficacy boost cyphers in the Cypher System Rulebook into one
cypher with variable effects based on cypher level.

| 01-10 | Area boost     |
|-------|----------------|
| 11-20 | Burst boost    |
| 21-30 | Damage boost   |
| 31-40 | Efficacy boost |
| 41-50 | Energy boost   |
| 51-60 | Range boost    |
| 61-80 | Shift boost    |
| 81-90 | Stunt boost    |
| 91-00 | Target boost   |

EFFICACY BOOST

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: This cypher boosts an ability that requires a skill roll. The
use of the ability is eased (eased by two steps if the cypher is level 5
or higher).

SHIFT BOOST

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: This cypher boosts one power shift

that the user already has, granting them an additional power shift in
that category that lasts for one round. For example, if the user has a
shift in resilience, they can use this cypher to gain an additional
shift in resilience for one round. If the user has more than one kind of
power shift (such as dexterity and strength), they choose which kind of
power shift to boost.

STUNT BOOST

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: This cypher eases the user’s next difficult, formidable, or
impossible power stunt task by four steps (eased by five steps if the
cypher is level 7 or higher). It has no effect on power stunts that
don’t require a successful power stunt task.

ARTIFACTS 

DARKEST BOOK

Level: 10

Form: Large, metal-bound book

Effect: Fashioned by the primordial entity who created evil magic, the
Darkest Book is

a record of every vile incantation, curse, and ritual ever performed. It
is known to include spells that create werewolves, raise an army of
zombies, revive a dead body as a vampire, conjure demons and devils, and
release profane energy for various effects. It eases by three steps any
task related to magical lore.

Even someone unskilled at magic can open it to a random page and read
the spell there (the GM randomly determines the spell by rolling on the
Fantastic Cypher table), which takes effect at level 10.

The Darkest Book is somewhat sentient and can hide its words from anyone
it doesn’t want reading it. It might require a person casting a spell
from it to succeed at a difficulty 6 Intellect defense roll or take 6
points of Intellect damage and move one step down the damage track.

The book is technically indestructible; anything strong enough to
destroy an object of its level merely destroys one of its pages, and the
book can’t be destroyed as long as at least one page remains.

Depletion: —

OMNI ORB

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Glowing, orb-shaped technological device Effect: The user holding
the orb imagines

what they want to happen (similar to using a magical wish), and it
happens, within limits. The level of the effect granted is no greater
than the level of the orb, as determined by the GM, who can modify the
effect accordingly. (The larger the desired effect, the more likely the
GM will limit

it.) Activating the omni orb automatically moves the character using it
one step down the damage track.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (instead of depleting, a roll of 1 means the user
experiences a GM intrusion related to the effect they created)

A benchmark for setting an omni orb’s limits is to compare it to a
cypher of the orb’s level—if there is a cypher that can do what the PC
wants, and that cypher is equal to or less than the orb’s level, it
works. For example, if a team of superheroes tries to use a level 5 orb
to teleport to their base 100 miles away, the GM can look at the list of
cyphers and see that a teleporter (traveler) cypher can transport one
character up to 100 miles per cypher level, so transporting a group of
PCs 100 miles is probably within the orb’s power

SPACE RING

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Metal ring with a star insignia

Effect: The wearer is able to fly as effortlessly as walking, moving up
to a short distance each round in any direction. In space, if the wearer
does nothing but move for three actions in a row, they accelerate
greatly and can move up to 200 miles (320 km) per hour, or about 2,000
feet (600 m) each round. The ring also provides the wearer with
breathable air while in space or underwater (although this doesn’t
provide protection against poison gas or other air-based hazards). The
wearer can verbally communicate with other ring-wearers within 1 mile
(1.5 km), and verbally request information (relayed to them with a
synthesized voice) from the internet or a local equivalent.

Depletion: 1 in 1d100 (check each day of flying)

FAIRYTALE RULES MODULE

SPECIAL RULES

Fairy tale games have unique opportunities for magic that aren’t found
elsewhere— death, curses, blessings, and wishes are all prevalent in
fairy tales and make interesting elements in games. Here are some
suggested ways to handle them.

Death

You’ve probably noticed that in fairy tales, characters die all the
time. Or almost die. Or sleep forever instead of die. Or die and come
back to life. You get the idea.

Potentially, this will also be true in a fairy tale game. Thankfully,
death doesn’t have to be the end of a character’s life. There are any
number of ways to stop or reverse death, including artifacts, cyphers,
and abilities. Additionally, a few NPCs, such as witches or Death
themself, may have the power to bring someone back from the dead.

Typically, though, if a character dies and chooses to stay dead (or is
unable to find a way to return to life), they are dead—they no longer
have bodies, abilities, Pools,

and so on. They can communicate to the living only through magic.
Someone may stay dead for up to about a year (in game time) and still
return to life. After that time elapses, death is permanent.

Curses

In fairy tale games, curses are likely to be common. Most witches can
cast curses

of one form or another, as can many fey beings, queens, and sea
creatures. Even objects and places can cause a character to become
cursed. Characters might have multiple curses on them at the same time.

All curses have a level, from 1 to 10. The level affects how hard it is
to resist the curse, as well as how severe the effects are and how
difficult it is to remove the curse.

Curses work slightly differently than regular damage. Curses can have an
impact on the game and the game mechanics (a character is turned into a
fish or becomes invisible, all of their interactions are hindered, they
take ongoing damage, and so on), or they can have more of a roleplaying
impact (a character looks much older, they forget the word “apple,”
their skin turns golden). See the Curse table for a list of example
curses.

Preventing Curses 

When a character attempts to resist being cursed, they must make an
Intellect defense roll against the level of the curse being cast. Being
trained in Intellect defense eases

this task, as does having a skill in curses or resisting curses.

Often, part of a curse’s effects is hindering curse resistance; thus, a
character who already has one curse on them will find defending against
a second curse is more difficult (their task is hindered).

Removing Curses 

Similar to poison and disease, curses aren’t automatically removed when
a character makes a regular recovery roll. Instead, they stick around,
continuing to affect the PC long after the curse is cast. In order to
rid themselves of a curse, the character must take actions to remove it.
The actions required depend on the nature and level of the curse.

The easiest way to remove a curse is to find, buy, steal, borrow, or
otherwise acquire an object that removes curses (such as the blood pearl
blossom cypher). Alternatively, the character might be able to pay
someone who is skilled in curse removal to do the deed.

Curse Intrusions and Curse Mode 

In addition to dealing with the original effect of the curse, a cursed
character is more likely to have bad things happen to them. There are
two ways for the GM to work this into the game: curse intrusions and
Curse Mode. Ideally, you’ll want to use both of these, as they each add
something unique to the experience of being cursed.

Curse intrusions work like regular GM intrusions, and the cursed
character gets XP. However, they only get 1 XP instead of the usual 2,
and they must decide whether to keep it or give it to another player.
Introduce additional curse intrusions from the Curse Intrusions table
when it feels appropriate. This might be anytime the character has a big
success, when they’re in a particularly risky position, or when they
start to feel like they’ve forgotten about the curse.

Curse Mode. When using this rule, the GM increases the range of numbers
that trigger a GM intrusion. As soon as a character is cursed, every
time they roll a 1 or a 2 (instead of just a 1), they trigger a GM
intrusion. As time passes, GM intrusions happen on a roll of 1 to 3,
then a roll of 1 to 4, and so on. This potentially means that a die roll
in Curse Mode can indicate success i a task and still trigger a GM
intrusion. Curse Mode is similar to the Horror Mode optional rule in the
Cypher System Rulebook, with one exception: the escalation works at a
much slower pace. This is because Curse Mode is not designed to heighten
immediate tension, but rather to create a long-term sense of being
saddled with an unwanted and unpredictable negative effect.

Typically, the intrusion range is increased by 1 when:

• The character is cursed.

• The character starts a new day (or makes their ten-hour recovery
roll).

• The character actively takes an action to remove the curse (curses
like wreaking havoc, which is part of the reason they’re so hard to get
rid of).

• The character attempts to resist an additional curse being cast upon
them.

Once all curses are removed, Curse Mode is no longer in effect.

While not all regular GM intrusions are necessarily bad for the
character, curse intrusions always make the cursed PC’s situation worse.

Curse Intrusions 

| d6  | Curse                                                                   |
|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | An insect stings or bites the character at just the wrong moment.       |
| 2   | Something in the area makes the character sneeze loudly and repeatedly. |
| 3   | The character shimmers in and out of view.                              |
| 4   | A deep sense of despair comes over the character.                       |
| 5   | The character feels an overwhelming urge to start dancing.              |
| 6   | The character’s clothes are suddenly much too large.                    |

Curse Table 

Roll 1d20 on the Curse table to determine the effect of the curse, or
choose one that feels appropriate to the situation and the characters.

Typically, curses that have simple roleplaying effects (such as the
character’s inability to speak their own name) are lower-level curses,
while those that affect gameplay (such as decreasing recovery roll
points) are higher level. Curses that have multiple effects are likely
the highest level of all. However, sometimes an incredibly simple curse
is still very high level because the caster wants to make it very hard
to get rid of.

Curse Removal Table 

Some curses have a specific way that they must be removed. Others can be
removed in a variety of ways. You can use the table as a reference for
ways to remove or undo a curse, or you can roll 1d10 to give a curse a
specific method of removal.

There are also many artifacts, cyphers, and other objects in the world
that will remove (or prevent) curses.

Blessings 

When someone is blessed, it typically means that they are more likely to
receive a beneficial GM intrusion when they roll a 1 (or when the GM
deems it appropriate to give them an intrusion). The Blessing Intrusions
table provides examples of positive GM intrusions that a blessed
character might receive.

Blessing Intrusions 

| d6  | Blessing                                                           |
|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Someone randomly gives the character a small gift.                 |
| 2   | When the character speaks, gold coins fall from their mouth.       |
| 3   | A necessary item, map, or clue falls into the character’s lap.     |
| 4   | The weather is suddenly in the character’s favor.                  |
| 5   | Someone nearby just happens to have the thing the character needs. |
| 6   | A cypher or artifact works even better than expected.              |

Wishes 

Wishes can be granted via objects, creatures such as genies, or as part
of a bargain. When the character asks for a wish, the GM assigns it a
level. The larger and more difficult the wish, the higher the level.
Generally, a wish such as gaining an asset or inexpensive item is level
1, and a wish for an expensive item or for a foe to vanish is level 7.

In order for a wish to be granted, the character must succeed on an
Intellect-related task (usually persuasion or possibly intimidation)
equal to the wish’s level. On a failed roll, the wish is either not
granted at all or is partially granted, depending on the wish and the
creature or object that is granting it.

Even if a wish is granted, the character may not get exactly what they
want, especially if the wish is poorly worded, has multiple
interpretations, or asks for something that is utterly impossible (such
as destroying the entire world).

GM INTRUSIONS

GM intrusions present fantastic opportunities to imbue fairy tale games
with a bit more weirdness, wonder, and whimsy, all while making the game
more interesting and surprising for characters.

There’s a list of example GM intrusions in the Cypher System Rulebook,
and any of those would work in a fairy tale game. The GM intrusions
included in this section are more specifically designed with fairy tale
magic in mind—they’re what could happen when magic goes wrong (or
extraordinarily right).

Remember that GM intrusions don’t always mean that something has gone
wrong or is bad for the players (unless they are curse intrusions). A GM
intrusion could be the arrival of a good omen, the sudden reversal of a
curse, or something that seems bad at first (like falling down a rabbit
hole) but leads to something wonderful in the end (a whole new world to
explore!).

The Fairy Tale Intrusions tables are ways to quickly generate intrusions
appropriate to a fairy tale aesthetic. Roll on the appropriate table to
determine the intrusion that occurs, or choose one that feels right for
the situation.

|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | A mischievous brownie attempts to steal an object from the characters in the middle of an important conversation or fight.               |
| 2   | The NPC that the characters are talking to suddenly looks at their watch or the sky, says, “I’m late, I’m late,” and disappears.         |
| 3   | A character speaks and all of their words come out backward.                                                                             |

|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | One or more characters accidentally damage or offend a plant of some type, causing it to retaliate.                                                                    |
| 2   | A wren starts singing at a nearby crossroads, warning that something’s coming.                                                                                         |
| 3   | One of the characters trips and falls into a rabbit hole.                                                                                                              |
| 4   | Someone steals the moon just as the PCs are about to do an important task that requires moonlight.                                                                     |
| 5   | The tree that the characters are sitting under wakes up. Perhaps it is hungry, or maybe it just wants company.                                                         |
| 6   | The path that the characters have been following turns into a rushing river beneath their feet.                                                                        |
| 7   | Someone casting a curse nearby accidentally catches one of the characters in the magic, causing them to be affected (roll on the Curse table to determine the effect). |
| 8   | A mountain rises up suddenly between the place where the characters stand and the place they need to get to.                                                           |
| 9   | Somewhere far off, a magical effect backfires, causing a stampede of wild animals to run right toward the characters.                                                  |
| 10  | One of the characters smells gingerbread. The scent is so tempting, they have a hard time turning away from it.                                                        |

PLAYING IN A FAIRY TALE GAME

PLAYER INTRUSIONS

A player intrusion occurs when a player chooses to alter something in
the story, making things easier for a player character. It’s kind of a
reverse GM intrusion: instead of the GM giving the player XP and
introducing an unexpected complication for a character, the player
spends 1 XP

and presents a solution to a problem or complication.

Once Upon a Time: Someone you played with as a child reappears and helps
you in whatever you are doing. They may be alive or dead, but your heart
is warmed upon seeing them, for it’s been a long time.

As You Wish: You do something that reminds another person or creature in
the area of someone they once cared for deeply. They are eager to assist
you in whatever you’ve got going on, at least for a few minutes.

Once Upon a Dream: Not long ago, you dreamt of a scenario similar to the
one that you find yourself in now. You can’t remember all of the
details, but you remember enough to know some of what’s about to take
place, and it gives you an additional action to prepare something
useful.

Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo: A little sprinkle of magic from your fairy
godmother is all you need to achieve a goal, retry a task, or be better
at something you’re attempting to do.

Wish Upon a Star: Long ago, you helped part of a dying star return to
its rightful place in the sky. It keeps an eye on you and, in a moment
when it feels like all hope is lost, it sends a little magic or light to
aid you.

Dreams Do Come True: Something you wished for long ago comes true just
at this moment. It might be for a broken weapon to be fixed, an ally to
appear, or a bit of knowledge or understanding to arrive in your mind.

What’s Come to Pass: Not long ago, someone forewarned you of the exact
scenario that you find yourself in now. You know just what to do to put
yourself at an advantage in the situation.

Think Happy Thoughts: You think of something or someone that brings you
great joy, and it imbues your next few actions with magic, allowing you
to fly or do some other thing that you are normally unable to do.

I Can Show You the World: Something or someone in the area shows itself
to you, highlighting a route you were looking for, an object you had
lost, or an answer to a problem.

Happily Ever After: Through the power of your love for another, you use
magic to protect someone you care for. They are able to sidestep an
attack that would normally do them grave damage.

If a player has no XP to spend, they can’t use a player intrusion.

MINOR AND MAJOR SPECIAL EFFECT OPTIONS 

Any time a PC attempts an action and rolls a natural 19 or 20, they have
the option

of triggering a minor special effect or major special effect,
respectively. In fairy tales, almost anything goes, which can be
overwhelming to a player trying to decide what their character’s special
effect might be. Here are a few special effect options for players to
use or be inspired by.

Minor Effect Suggestions 

• A weapon comes alive at the perfect moment and does a bit more damage
to a foe.

• A fluctuation in magic hinders all of the foe’s tasks for one minute.

• A curse, spell, or ability has additional force behind it, and lasts a
round longer than expected.

• The foe’s magical armor begins to dissipate, decreasing the amount of
protection it offers on the next attack.

• A shapeshifting or disguise spell or ability dazzles the target,
easing all tasks related to it.

• A magical attack hits the target and something they were holding,
causing damage to both.

Major Effect Suggestions 

• A weapon comes alive at the perfect moment and does a lot more damage
to a foe.

• A fluctuation in magic prevents a foe from taking their next action.

• A curse that was cast upon you by the foe you’re attacking is removed.

• A foe surrenders, agreeing to lay down their weapons.

• A foe accidentally steps on a living plant or dangerous creature while
trying to dodge your blow, and it attacks them or holds them fast.

• A shapeshifting or disguise spell or ability works so well that the
foe’s familiar or companion runs off, afraid to continue the fight.

CREATING YOUR CHARACTER 

FORM VS. FUNCTION

In a fairy tale game, the PCs might consist of a talking fox, an ogre, a
fairy, and a human the size of your thumb. And that’s perfectly fine.
Build your character sentence in a way that plays to your character’s
strengths and weaknesses, and the rest can be handled through story and
narrative. Playing a talking bear, a gingerbread

man, or a changeling will likely affect your character’s appearance,
their outlook on life, and their backstory, but it doesn’t necessarily
affect their abilities, skills, and Pools beyond what you choose during
character creation.

Because the form that you choose doesn’t typically offer you something
in addition to your Cypher System stats—being small, for example, does
not inherently mean you’re stealthy—you’ll want to choose your stats to
emphasize the bit of your character that you want to play.

SKILLS

As described in the Cypher System Rulebook, there is no definitive list
of skills. Characters can choose to become skilled in anything they like
(with the GM’s permission). In addition to the suggested skills in the
rulebook, useful skills for fairy tale games might include: 

• Talking animals\*

• Talking nature\*

• Trickery

• Using magic 

• Weather

• Baking

• Cobbling 

• Curses

• Dancing 

• Death

• Magic

• Playing an instrument 

• Puzzles

• Riddles

• Sailing

• Sensing magic 

• Singing

Remember that only skills gained through character type abilities or in
other rare instances allow you to become skilled with attack or defense
tasks. Thus, all magic skills are noncombat skills only.

\* These skills could be used in a number of different ways, depending
on the setting. If the setting has talking animals that the players
can’t understand, the talking animals skill could help a PC communicate
with them in other ways. If there are talking animals that the
characters can understand, the skill could provide an asset in social
interactions.

TYPE

Your character’s type is the core of who they are and how they interact
with their environment, their companions, and other living creatures
they encounter.

Heartwood Foci

Adjusted Foci

Battles Robots, Builds Robots, Talks to Machines

Best for settings that include elements of science fiction.
Alternatively, “robots” can be a stand-in for puppets, steampunk
entities, golems, or other creations such as Pinocchio, Edward
Scissorhands, the Gingerbread Man, and the Tin Man. Mister Geppetto
would likely be someone who Builds Robots, while Muska (from Miyazaki’s
film Laputa: Castle in the Sky) might be someone who Battles Robots.

Drives Like a Maniac

Best for modern settings or those where traditional fairy tale vehicles
such as horse-drawn carriages, magic carpets, witch’s brooms, and
chicken-legged huts are common.

Fuses Flesh and Steel, Fuses Mind and Machine

Best for steampunk or weird science mashups. Edward Scissorhands and the
Tin Man are probably characters who Fuse Flesh and Steel. Alternatively,
renaming the foci to Fuses Flesh and Magic or Wants to Become a Real Boy
can provide characters with the same benefits from a more
magical-sounding source.

Is Licensed to Carry

With small tweaks to the language and abilities, this could work for
someone who wants to wield a wand, bow, or other ranged weapon. 

Sailed Beneath the Jolly Roger

With small tweaks to the language and abilities, this could work for
someone who used to be a sailor or pirate.

FAIRY TALE CHARACTER ARCS

Character arcs are fantastic opportunities for players to deepen their
roleplaying options, add to the narrative, and set goals that can
intertwine with and strengthen a campaign or adventure. While character
arcs aren’t a requirement, they work particularly well in fairy tale
games, where individual goals and tasks are often at the forefront of
what drives adventures.

Players can pick from any of the sample character arcs in the Cypher
System Rulebook, make up their own (with the assistance and approval of
the GM), or choose one of the new character arcs created specifically
for the Heartwood setting.

EQUIPMENT 

Most weapons that are powered by magic, such as wands, operate exactly
like a regular weapon; they just do their damage using magic.

Equipment and weapons with unique magic abilities are typically
considered to be cyphers or artifacts.

CURRENCY

In most fairy tales, money isn’t precise. Someone might be poor or rich.
They might find a bag of gold or a chest full of jewels. They might be
the richest man in the town or have nothing but a tired old cow to their
name. But typically what they don’t have is “one gold piece” or “thirty
farthings” to their name. This means that whatever your fairy tale
setting, you can think in general terms of money instead of keeping
meticulous track of every penny, farthing, gold coin, or dollar.

To keep things easy, no matter what currency your characters use, think
of money as being in simple amounts that scale up, such as a copper
coin, a silver coin, and a gold coin. These could easily equate to the
inexpensive, moderate, and expensive items on the equipment list. Items
that are very expensive might be worth a bag of silver, while exorbitant
items might be worth a bag of gold.

Additionally, if the PCs are completing a character arc, accomplishing a
task, or doing some other type of action to receive a piece of
equipment, you can use the price category to decide how complicated or
difficult that task is. A moderately priced item likely requires
completing a moderately difficult task, while an exorbitant item may
require something that taxes the PCs and really puts their skills and
dedication to the test.

SIGNATURE ITEMS

In fairy tales, clothing, weapons, and other items that a character
carries for a long time tend to be very personal and very important.
They’re often unique and handcrafted,

they may have names or stories that go with them, and because characters
tend to keep them for a long time, they may have undergone repairs or
have markings that tell something about the character’s background.

APPAREL AND ARMOR

In most cases, characters start out by wearing any type of clothing they
choose. Typically (unless the GM decides otherwise or unless it is
designated as armor),

this clothing is purely for decorative and roleplaying purposes and
offers no additional benefits.

However, clothing with additional benefits can be purchased, stolen,
found, or earned by completing favors and accomplishing tasks. 

Optional Rule: I Have That!

In fairy tales, characters often have exactly the right mundane piece of
equipment

that they need to bypass a story-related obstacle hidden away in a
pocket or a bag. Rather than having the PCs stock up on mundane items
like marbles, rope, and breadcrumbs in town, use the I Have That! rule.
This means players don’t have to keep exact track of their characters’
mundane equipment; instead, they spend an amount to get an unspecified
“Pocket Item” in

that category. Then, when they’re out in the world and realize they
could solve a problem with an item, they can just say, “I have that!”
and pull it from their pocket. All Pocket Items are one-use only; after
using them, the PC marks off one of their Pocket Items for the
appropriate price category.

Most Pocket Items are inexpensive, but moderate and expensive Pocket
Items exist, and are likely more useful than their less expensive
counterparts.

The GM has veto power over items that they don’t think you could have
found or carried.

Using the I Have That! rule doesn’t preclude PCs from also purchasing
these items directly. For example, if a character who sews wants to buy
a thimble and an inexpensive Pocket Item, they can. However, they cannot
later turn the thimble into a Pocket Item; it remains a thimble.

Lodging, solo room, decent

Very Expensive

Exorbitant 

Magic transportation, rental (chicken-legged hut, levitating mortar,

it’s also necessary to hire a guide, driver, or other person who can
control and power the vehicle. Alternatively, characters must take a
class, learn a spell, or meet other magic requirements in order to
operate the vehicle.

CYPHERS AND ARTIFACTS

Because magic—and thus magic items— are so prevalent in most fairy
tales, cyphers in particular should be easy for characters to replenish.
If you’re using subtle cyphers, you can choose how they arrive—on magic
storms, perhaps, or in pockets of magic that exist throughout the world.
Or maybe the magic is such that it just works, ensuring that cyphers
show up whenever the characters need them.

Manifest cyphers should be readily available too—likely they can be
found for cheap at a local market, stashed in hollow tree trunks or bird
nests, or scattered about the forest floor. Manifest cyphers may also be
integrated into people’s clothing or furnishings as unique adornments.

Artifacts are typically more valuable and less common. Therefore, player
characters are less likely to encounter them at random and more likely
to find them in the hands of NPCs, locked or hidden in chests, or for
sale by high-end and specialized vendors. Acquiring an artifact should
almost always require a sacrifice, trial, or difficult task.

CYPHER LIMITS 

All characters have a maximum number of cyphers they can have at any one
time, determined by their type. If a character ever attempts to carry
more cyphers than their limit, the magic within the cyphers quickly
begins to attract fey beings. Fey beings may react by stealing one or
more cyphers, cursing the character, or even stealing the character away
to a fey realm.

Obviously, having a fey being steal a character away to their realm

is a story-changer. If you’re using this as an option, figure out ahead
of time what type of

fey is attracted, what their realm is like, and how to play out the
character’s disappearance and possible retrieval.

CYPHERS  
Cyphers are one-use abilities that characters gain over the course of
play. They have powers that can heal, do damage, ease or hinder tasks,
or produce interesting and unusual effects. In a fairy tale setting,
they often appear as a simple object, such as a poisoned apple or a
matchbook. They can also be something intangible, such as three wishes
or a magic word. The shifting state of magic in fairy tales makes it
easy to use both manifest and subtle cyphers in the same setting and
campaign if you desire.

In settings full of magic, cyphers should be both readily available and
regularly used. If the PCs are hoarding or saving their cyphers, feel
free to give them a reason to use them. And have a list of replacement
cyphers ready so the players never have to go without.

Typically, something like a handful of magic beans or apple seeds

is considered a single cypher even though there are multiple items.

Cypher Forms

While characters can find or purchase many of these items in the world,
only magic versions of the items are cyphers. Characters should easily
be able to tell when an item is magic (and thus a cypher) and when it’s
an ordinary item.

A SELECTION OF FAIRY TALE CYPHERS

Adderstone

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Stone with a hole in the middle

Effect: For the next day, provides the character with one of the
following benefits. Roll a d20 or choose from the table.

Adderstones are sometimes also called hagstones, seer stones, and holey
stones.

Beware false adderstones, which are made by enterprising swindlers who
drill or carve a hole out of a regular stone and attempt to pass it off
as something more.

If a character has no hair in which to tie an adderstone, perhaps they
can “borrow” some from a friend, a domesticated animal, or a foe.

| d20   | Effect                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-3   | When looking through the hole, the user gains an asset to seeing things that are normally invisible to the eye, including doorways, beings, spirits, magical effects, and so on. |
| 4-6   | When worn on the finger as a ring, wards off spirits of the dead (grants +1 Armor against attacks from ghosts, haunts, and other spirits of the dead).                           |
| 7-9   | When attached to physical armor, adds 1 to the Armor it provides (adds 2 to the Armor if the cypher is level 6 or higher).                                                       |
| 10-12 | When held in the mouth, protects against poisons (up to the level of the cypher).                                                                                                |
| 13-15 | When placed on the finger of another with good intent, it adds 1 to the recovery rolls of both the user and the wearer.                                                          |
| 16-18 | When worn on a string around the neck, provides training in two noncombat skills of the user’s choice that they are not already trained in.                                      |
| 19-20 | When tied in the hair, eases all defense tasks against curses by two steps.                                                                                                      |

Agate Eye

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Striped stone that looks like a dragon’s eye

Effect: When ground up and added to food or drink, or applied to the
skin, renders the user immune to poisons of the cypher level or lower
for one hour per cypher level (and ends any such ongoing effects, if
any, already in the user’s system).

Animated Wood

Level: 1d6

Form: Chunk of pine, alder, or other wood

imbued with magical properties Effect: Writing a word, such as “child,”
“horse,” or “sword,” on the wood causes it to become a living version of
that word. The living version is no bigger than 10 feet by 10 feet by 20
feet (3 m by 3 m by 6 m) and its level is equal to the cypher level. It
can make attacks or perform actions as commanded to the best of its
abilities and lasts for one hour per cypher level. Commanding it is not
an action.

Once activated, animated wood is not an unthinking, docile being. It
may, in fact, resist the user’s commands and attempt to take its own
actions. Any actions it takes cannot be harmful to the user or the
user’s allies. The user may attempt to stop an unwanted action via
persuasion, intimidation, and so on (any such tasks against the animated
wood are eased by two steps).

Anywhere Door

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Chalk, pen, pencil, lipstick, or marker 

Effect: Creates a door to anywhere. The door remains for one day, and
then disappears. While the door exists, anyone or anything that can
discern the door can use it. Erasing the drawn line erases the door.

Apple of Discord

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Beautiful golden apple that catches the eye of all who see it

Effect: When tossed up to a long distance away, it affects all foes in
short range of the apple, causing them to attempt to take it for
themselves. Foes spend their next two actions doing nothing but fighting
among themselves for possession of the apple.

Azure Dust

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Handful of dust from the Fairy with the Turquoise Hair

Effect: Sprinkling the dust on someone’s hair, skin, outfit, or other
object permanently dyes it bright blue.

one hour.

Bellman’s Map of the Ocean

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Blank sheet of paper rolled and tied with a hair tie

Effect: When unrolled, convinces everyone

within short range that the character holding the map knows far more
than they do. For the next ten minutes, affected beings look upon the
map- holder as their leader or guide, will not attack them, and
generally will do as they ask (all social interactions with those
affected are eased by two steps).

Beloved’s Kiss

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Ruby red ring

Effect: When pressed to the lips of a character, beloved’s kiss prevents
the occurrence of one specific condition of the cypher level or lower.
Additionally, it ends any such ongoing effect, if

any, in the user’s system. Roll a d6 to determine the result.

| d6  | Condition                                                                                                   |
|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-2 | Renders the character immune to poisons for one hour per cypher level (and ends any ongoing effects)        |
| 3-4 | Renders the character immune to curses for one hour per cypher level (and ends any ongoing effects)         |
| 5-6 | Renders the character immune to mental effects for one hour per cypher level (and ends any ongoing effects) |

Bird’s Nest Coronet

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Beautifully woven bird’s nest 

Effect: When worn like a crown, the bird’s nest creates an illusion over
the wearer, making them appear like royalty. Others are more likely to
follow their suggestions, defer to their wishes, and treat them well.
All social interactions are eased by two steps for one day. Seeing
through the disguise is an Intellect task equal to the cypher’s level.

Blackbird Pie

Level: 1d6

Form: Four-and-twenty blackbirds baked in a pie

Effect: When the pie is cut open, the blackbirds begin to sing a
haunting dirge of pain and sorrow. All foes within long range who hear
the song are hindered on all tasks for ten minutes.

Blood Pearl Blossom

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Rare blood-red flower with a beautiful pearl in its center

Effect: When ingested, removes one curse (of the cypher level or lower)
from the user. The curse-removal process can take from one round to one
day, depending on the level, severity, and type of curse.

Bone Key

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Human finger bone carved into a skeleton key

Effect: Unlocks one lock of the cypher level or lower, or provides an
asset to open a lock of higher level.

Bones of the Beloved

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Handful of ground bones 

Effect: When eaten, the bones begin a process of lowering the eater’s
apparent age. Over the next three days, the user begins to look younger
and younger, until they reach the appearance of someone no younger than
their mid-twenties. Their hair shines, their teeth glow, their wrinkles
disappear, their back unstoops. The effect lasts for three days (five
days if the cypher is level 6 or higher). This does not change the
actual health or age of the character.

Bowl of Porridge

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Just-right bowl of porridge

Effect: Restores a number of points equal to the cypher level to the
user’s Might Pool. Also protects the user from the effects of cold for
ten minutes.

Cat Sidhe Medallion

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Medallion in the shape of the white symbol on a cat sidhe’s chest 

Effect: When activated, the medallion protects the wearer from the next
curse (of the cypher level or lower) that is cast upon them. The curse
goes into the medallion, which shatters into thousands of tiny pieces.

Cheshire Smile

Level: 1d6

Form: Mischievous grin

Effect: When hung in the air, the grin slowly transforms into a grey
Cheshire Cat that seems to be made mostly of smoke and shadow. It has
huge blue eyes and an enormous grin. The cat acts as a creature (level
equal to the cypher’s level) with a mind of its own, although it likely
helps the person who activated the cypher. It sticks around for ten
minutes, and then fades away slowly, until even the original smile has
disappeared.

Coalheart’s Beard Balm

Level: 1d6

Form: Jar of balm

Effect: When rubbed on the face, the balm grows into a long, golden
beard in about ten minutes. When the user tugs on their beard, it points
them in the direction of valuable treasure, the location of which was
previously unknown to the user. If someone else cuts the beard before
the treasure is found, it loses its power. After the treasure is found,
the beard remains. But once it is shaved or cut, it does not grow back.

Many dwarfs have beards with magical powers. It’s possible to find other
beard balm cyphers out in the world.

Croc’s Clock

Level: 1d6

Form: Tiny ticking clock, no bigger than a thumbnail

Effect: When attached to (or swallowed by) a living creature or an
object, the clock ticks loudly, alerting everyone within long range to
its presence for one day.

Crown Jewel

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Shining jewel from a royal crown 

Effect: When attached to an item such as a weapon, shield, armor,
cypher, or artifact, creates an exact duplicate of the item. The
duplicate works just like the original and lasts for ten minutes or
until it naturally depletes (whichever comes first).

Dame Trot’s Cat

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Statue of a cat

Effect: When activated by feeding it a bit of milk or fish, the statue
protects the user, yowling and hissing the next time it senses danger.
The cat’s level is equal to the cypher level.

Darning Needle

Level: 1d6

Form: Needle with a large eye

Effect: When activated, grows into a larger version of itself that acts
as a medium weapon. It inflicts 4 points of damage and causes anything
it successfully hits to shrink to half its size. The needle lasts for a
number of hours equal to the cypher’s level.

Dead Water

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Vial, pot, or jar of black liquid 

Effect: Brings a character back to life. However, they come back with a
permanent 3-point reduction in their maximum Might Pool.

Deathless

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Needle inside an egg

Effect: When a character places their soul inside the needle and places
the needle inside the egg, they are protected from their next death.
When the character dies, they return to life on the next round, with all
of their Pools full.

Using the deathless does not protect the character from taking damage or
moving down the damage track. Placing the soul and returning to life are
actions. Once the cypher holds the user’s soul, it no longer counts
against their cypher limit.

If someone gets a hold of another person’s soul, they have a great deal
of power over that person (such as easing all actions against them by
three steps). Those who use a deathless should ensure that it’s well
hidden and well protected.

Death’s Candle

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Small, half-burnt black candle 

Effect: Once the candle is lit, it burns for a number of rounds equal to
the cypher’s level. During that time, the user who lit it is protected
from death or being moved down the damage track. While the candle burns,
if the character would normally die, they do not and instead reject all
damage. For example, if a character has 5 points left in their last
Pool, and a foe inflicts 5 points

of damage on them, putting all their Pools at 0, the user takes no
damage. However, if a foe inflicts 4 points of damage, which is not
enough to kill the user, the user takes the 4 points of damage.

Death’s Messengers

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Bottle, vial, or box filled with three wisps of dark smoke

Effect: The three smoke wisps wrap around a creature within close range,
causing them to feel dizzy, experience ringing in their ears, and have
blurred vision. For the next three rounds, the cypher inflicts damage
equal to the cypher’s level (each round).

Diadem of Death

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Crown made of feathers, bits of bone, burnt hair, and old teeth

Effect: When worn on someone’s head, looped over a limb, or otherwise
placed upon their person, the crown inflicts damage equal to its level.

Dragon’s Blood

Level: 1d6

Form: Powdered dragon’s blood

Effect: When mixed with liquid and painted on a living being, grants one
of the following effects for a day.

| d6  | Effect                                                   |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-2 | +2 to Armor                                              |
| 3-4 | Asset to all tasks involving magic                       |
| 5-6 | Asset to all tasks involving romance, sex, and fertility |

Dragon’s Teeth

Level: 1d6

Form: Handful of dragon’s teeth

Effect: When planted, the dragon’s teeth grow into three fully armed
warriors. The warriors can understand the verbal commands of the person
who planted them. Once they are grown, commanding them is not an action.
They can make attacks and perform actions to the best of their
abilities. The warriors can never go farther than long range from the
character who planted them

Planting the teeth is an action. It takes two rounds for the teeth to
grow into warriors. The warriors last for one hour per cypher level.

Warriors: level 3; Armor 1; swords inflict 3 points of damage

Dressmaking Nut

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Walnut or other shelled nut, with hinges and a clasp

Effect: The nut opens to reveal a stunning and spectacular ballgown,
evening dress, or tuxedo. The outfit is the perfect size, shape, style,
and color for the person who wishes to wear it. While worn, the outfit
eases all tasks involving charm, persuasion, and etiquette for one hour.
After 

that, the outfit may still be worn, but no longer offers any benefits.

Beings of all genders can wear any form of outfit from the dressmaking
nut and receive the benefits.

Drink Me

Level: 1d6

Form: Liquid inside a glass bottle with a paper label that says “DRINK
ME” 

Effect: Causes the imbiber to shrink down to half their size. The effect
lasts for one hour or until the user can find another way to change
their size (such as with an eat me).

Dust of the Dreamer

Level: 1d6

Form: Pouch of very fine, rainbow-hued dust 

Effect: When sprinkled in the eyes, grants the recipient all the
benefits of a ten-hour recovery roll as a single action. This does not
use up any of their recovery rolls.

Eat Me

Level: 1d6

Form: Very small cake with the words “EAT ME” written on it in currants

Effect: Causes the eater to grow to twice their size. The effect lasts
for one hour or until the user can find another way to change their size
(such as with a drink me).

Emperor’s New Clothes

Level: 1d6

Form: Magical thread sewn onto armor 

Effect: For the next day, the armor the thread is attached to is
invisible, making the wearer appear to be unarmored.

Fairy Cup

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Decorated vessel made of precious materials

Effect: When the cup is buried in the ground, it grants the person who
buried it protection. They gain +2 Armor against all physical and mental
attacks for one day.

It’s believed that burying a fairy cup returns it to its rightful owners
below ground, and it is they who offer protection by way of thanks.

False Grandmother

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Pair of wire-rimmed glasses

Effect: While wearing the glasses, the user designates one living
creature that

they can see. For the next ten minutes per cypher level, the user is
disguised as someone the designated creature knows well. The user has no
say in who that person is, but while the disguise is active, all
interactions with the designated creature are eased by two steps. The
user can remove the glasses to look like themselves again before the end
of the duration.

Father’s Betrayal

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Small stone shaped like a heart 

ffect: For the next ten minutes, a creature that the user can see is
banished from an area 30 feet by 30 feet (9 m by 9 m) around the user.
If the creature is within that area when the cypher is activated, they
are knocked outside the area and are dazed for one round, hindering
their next action.

Flaming Arrow

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Arrow with a silver-white shaft, golden head, and fletching of
peacock feathers 

Effect: The arrow explodes into flame when it strikes something,
inflicting its level in damage to all within immediate range.

Flowers for Grandmother

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Fresh-picked bouquet of flowers tied with a red ribbon

Effect: Giving the flowers to someone else provides both the recipient
and the giver an asset in defense against damage of a specified kind for
one hour. Roll a d6 to determine the effect.

| d6  | Effect                |
|-----|-----------------------|
| 1   | Curses                |
| 2   | Fire/heat             |
| 3   | Ice/cold              |
| 4   | Poison                |
| 5   | Intellect             |
| 6   | Slashing and piercing |

Forget-Me-Knot

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Length of magical rope

Effect: Knotting the rope together to form a loop allows the user to
capture a memory from their past. They don’t lose the memory when
capturing it with the forget-me-knot. When the user unties the loop,
everyone in close range spends one round doing nothing but experiencing
the memory as if it were their own. If the memory is particularly sad,
loving, scary, and so on, all affected beings likely spend an additional
round dealing with the emotional impacts of that memory. Capturing the
memory is an action, as is untying the loop.

Genie’s Handkerchief

Level: 1d6

Form: Extremely large handkerchief with one corner coated in mercury

Effect: Rubbing the cloth over a wound heals the wound (restores all
points to the character’s Pools), but also uses up one recovery roll for
the day.

Genie’s handkerchiefs come in many colors and materials. Some people
find that after

their magic is used up, they make fine blankets, curtains, or cloaks. Of
course, extended exposure to mercury has its drawbacks.

Gilded Shell

Level: 1d6

Form: Golden snail shell

Effect: When blown into softly, the shell expands into a simple
structure with a front door and walls that let in a soft light. From
inside the structure, it’s about 10 feet by 10 feet by 20 feet (3

m by 3 m by 6 m). From the outside, the shell continues to look exactly
the way it did before, in both size and shape, making it difficult for
others to notice. Once expanded, the structure is permanent and
immobile.

Gingerbread Man

Level: 1d6

Form: Gingerbread cookie in the shape of a human, lavishly decorated

Effect: After eating the cookie, the user has training in Speed defense
for the next day.

Godfather’s Picture Book

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Large book full of tales

Effect: When someone flips through the pages quickly, time is altered.
If the user flips through the book forward, time jumps forward. Flip
backward and time jumps backward. Moving time forward gives the user an
additional action on their turn. Moving it backward allows them to retry
their previous action. After the book is used this way once, it becomes
a regular book and does not count against the character’s cypher limit.

Golden Beetle

Level: 1d6

Form: Golden scarab beetle

Effect: When dropped into liquid and cooked, it creates enough food to
fill the stomachs of all friends and allies within long range.

Golden Vanity

Level: 1d6

Form: Golden vanity set in a small, sturdy box that includes a brush,
comb, and mirror

Effect: Each item may be used once and has a different effect:

Golden brush: Creates bristly terrain in an immediate area, which counts
as difficult terrain.

Golden comb: Creates jagged, toothy rocks in an immediate area, making
it extremely painful to cross. Characters within the area take 1 point
of damage each round from the rocks.

Golden mirror: Turns into a tall glass mountain 30 feet tall by 300 feet
wide (9 m by 90 m). All climbing tasks are hindered, and a fall from any
height does 3 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor).

The landscape effects are permanent. The golden vanity counts as a
single cypher against the character’s cypher limit. When all three items
have been used, it remains a functional vanity set but no longer holds
any magic.

Green Spectacles

Level: 1d6

Form: Pair of glasses with bright green lenses

Effect: Once activated, protects the wearer from being blinded or having
their vision affected in other ways for one day. The wearer can see
through illusions of the cypher level or lower and can see in the dark
as if it were daylight.

Hart’s Heart

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Still-beating heart from a forest stag, kept in an ornate lined
box

attempts by the user to bribe, deceive, coerce, or convince the
recipient are eased by two steps.

Heart of a Star

Level: 1d6

Form: Still-warm piece of a fallen star 

Effect: For the next ten minutes, when the user helps another character
while holding the star, that character’s task is eased by an additional
step. (If the user has an inability in the relevant skill, the other
character’s task is still eased.)

Heart’s Tart

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Red tart in the shape of a heart 

Effect: When eaten, eases all tasks involving stealing, picking pockets,
sneaking, running, surprise, and initiative for ten minutes.

level to the user’s Might Pool.

Iron Bands of Three

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Three flexible iron bands

Effect: Wrapping the iron bands around the user’s heart keeps it from
breaking with trouble and anxiety. While wearing the bands, the user
automatically succeeds on their next three Intellect defense rolls
against anything that would make them feel sad, fearful, intimidated,
and so on. Each time the cypher activates to protect the user, one of
the bands breaks. When all three bands are broken, the cypher is used
up.

Itsy Bitsy Spider

Level: 1d6

Form: Tiny spider inside a jar, box, or thimble

Effect: When released, the spider sets up a web in a nearby corner. For
the next ten minutes, the web catches thoughts, secrets, and information
about the general area (up to about a square mile), including any
creatures, people, weather, or goings on. At the end of that time, the
user can read the web, gaining answers to a number of questions equal to
the cypher’s level. The questions must pertain to the area and must be
simple enough that the spider can answer them in three words or less.

Jack’s Candlestick

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Burning candlestick

Effect: Jumping over the candlestick restores a number of points equal
to the cypher’s level to the user’s Speed Pool.

Jiminy Cricket

Level: 1d6

Form: Small wooden or metal cricket 

Effect: Allows the user to retry a task that they failed within the past
minute, using the same difficulty and modifiers.

The Key of Knowing

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Golden key that is permanently stained with blood

Effect: When used to open a lock (of the cypher level or lower), grants
the user the opportunity to ask three yes-or-no questions about a
person, place, or thing. The key answers to the best of its ability and
knowledge, and it does not attempt to lie or trick the user with its
answer.

After the key is used in this way, the blood disappears from its surface
and the key refuses to open anything (or speak) ever again.

Knave of Hearts

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Playing card depicting an elegant knight

Effect: Turns the user into the knight depicted on the card. They take
on the appearance, voice, and mannerisms of the knight. They also gain

effect lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.

Lion’s Courage

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Small medallion with the word “COURAGE” inscribed upon it. 

Effect: When activated, grants the user additional courage in the face
of fear. For ten minutes per cypher level, any time the user is attacked
and they attempt to make an attack on their next action, that attack is
eased and they inflict +1 point of damage.

Living Water

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Vial, pot, or jar of liquid

Effect: Removes any ongoing damage, lasting damage, or permanent damage
the character has. However, the character has a permanent 3-point
reduction in their maximum Might Pool.

When dead water and living water cyphers are used together, a dead
character can be brought back to life without any permanent reductions
of their Might Pool.

Magic Beans

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Handful of magic beans

Effect: When planted and watered, the beans grow into a giant beanstalk.
It’s almost impossible to know where the beanstalk leads until you climb
it. Climbing the beanstalk is a level 5 task.

Memory’s Match

Level: 1d6

Form: Matchbox with one match inside 

Effect: Lighting the match causes everyone nearby to see a vision that
comforts them. Those who watch the vision in the flame for one round
feel rejuvenated and comforted. Anyone who makes a recovery roll in the
next ten minutes gains +3 to the roll. After that, anyone who watched
the vision but didn’t make a recovery roll takes 3 points of Intellect
damage (ignores Armor).

Mermaid Tear

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Tear-shaped drop of sea glass

Effect: When swallowed, fills the user with an overwhelming sense of
sadness. The user takes 1 point of Intellect damage, but gains an asset
on any tasks involving water for the next ten minutes. The task must
involve water in a significant way (for example, swinging a sword while
it’s raining likely doesn’t count, but crying as part of an attempt to
persuade someone, casting a magic spell involving water, or using a pool
to scry would all be appropriate).

Neverlost

Level: 1d6

Form: Bag of bread crumbs, pebbles, or candy

Effect: When dropped along a path or trail,

the items become invisible to everyone except the user and any allies
the user designates. The items last for one day per cypher level and can
be seen by the user and their allies, even in complete darkness.

Nonsensical Poem

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Nonsense poem written in mirror writing

Effect: Reading the poem aloud lets the user reverse one thing about
their present situation for up to ten minutes. Up becomes down. Gravity
works the other way. A river flows backward. The sun shines at night.
(The player should work with the GM to come up with an appropriate and
acceptable change.)

Omniscient Bean

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Magical bean made into a cake 

Effect: When eaten, the bean allows the

user to tap into magic. They can ask the GM one question related to
their current task, location, or action and get a general answer. The GM
assigns a level to the question, so the more obscure the answer, the
more difficult the task. Generally, knowledge that a PC could find by
looking somewhere other than their current location is level 1, and
obscure knowledge of the past is level 7. The cypher cannot provide an
answer to a question above its level (which means it can’t provide
knowledge about the future, since that is level 10).

Pictureless Book

Level: 1d6

Form: Book without pictures

Effect: Reading the book aloud for one round causes all who hear it
within short range (except the user) to fall into a deep sleep for one
round. While they sleep, they have intense dreams and cannot take any
other actions. The dreams affect them in one of the following ways.

Pictureless book affects NPCs’ health instead of their Pools, either
restoring them to full health or doing 5 points of damage.

| d6  | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-2 | Sweet dreams. All dreaming characters have all of their Pools restored to full.                                                                                                          |
| 3-4 | Nightmares. All dreaming characters take 5 points of Intellect damage.                                                                                                                   |
| 5-6 | Dream world. All dreaming characters enter a dream world, where they have an experience that causes them to temporarily learn a noncombat skill of their choice for the rest of the day. |

Poison for Your Daughter 

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Clear liquid that can be spread on any object, such as an apple,
hair comb, or weapon

Poisoned Apple

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Apple that is half white and half red 

Effect: Eating from the white half heals the user, restoring a number of
points equal to the cypher’s level to their Might Pool. Eating from the
red half poisons the user, inflicting damage equal to the cypher’s
level. Each half of the apple has the power to affect only one creature.

Both halves of the apple can be used by the same or different people as
long as it’s done within a few rounds of each other. However, in order
for the cypher to take effect, the user must willingly take a bite. It’s
impossible, for instance, to force-feed someone part of the apple and
have the cypher activate.

Poppet (Damage)

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Small figure made of cloth, stuffed with hair and bone

Effect: Writing the name of an object or living being on the figure
connects the figure with that object or being. Destroying the poppet
inflicts damage on the connected object or being equal to the cypher’s
level, no matter how far away it is. Writing the name and destroying the
poppet are separate actions.

Poppet (Love)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Small figure made of wax, adorned with flowers and herbs

Effect: Giving the poppet to another living being in a short ceremony
(usually simply saying the being’s name and making an offer of deep
positive emotion) protects them from all harmful effects the next time
they are attacked. If the positive emotion is returned (such as between
friends or lovers), the giver is also protected. For example, the next
time someone swings a sword, speaks a curse, or tries to poison the
creature, the attempt automatically fails, and if the creature were to
slip near a deep pit, they would not fall into it. Giving the poppet to
another is an action.

Poppet (Prosperity)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Small figure made of cloth, stuffed with herbs and bits of wood

Effect: Writing the name of an object or living being on the figure
connects the figure with that object or being. Dirtying, tearing, and
damaging the poppet causes the connected being or object to appear
destitute and poor to all who see them. This effect lasts for a day.
Writing the name and damaging the poppet are separate actions.

Poppet (Silence)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Small figure carved from wood or stone, with an open mouth 

Effect: Stuffing the open mouth with something that belongs to a living
being (such as hair, teeth, or fabric) connects the figure to that
being. For the following day, the being is unable to talk about, point
to, see, or otherwise engage with the person who activated the poppet.

Powder of Life

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Bit of powder carried in a pepper box 

Effect: When sprinkled on an inanimate

object, the powder brings it to life. The object doesn’t change in any
way—a small cat made of glass remains a small cat made of glass—except
that now it is alive. The living object acts as a level 2 creature with
a mind of its own. While it has an affinity or obligation for the one
who brought it to life, it doesn’t obey commands.

Objects animated by the powder of life should have stats that represent

their form and nature. For example, a tin soldier brought to life likely
has 1 Armor and perhaps a light weapon, while a stuffed rabbit might be
level 3 for the purpose of Speed defense, hiding, and sneaking.

Princess’s Pea

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Dried pea that was previously slept on 

Effect: For one hour per cypher level, allows the user to recognize
disguises, optical illusions, sound mimicry, false claims, and other
such tricks (for all senses) for what they are.

Rabbit Hole

Level: 1d6

Form: Pocket watch with an empty face 

Effect: Laying the pocket watch facedown on the ground creates a rabbit
hole that goes directly to a place that the user states. The user must
have previously been to the stated place, and must enter the rabbit hole
before anyone else, ideally by jumping in feet first. The hole grows to
the appropriate size to accommodate the user and anyone traveling with
them. Travel inside the hole is not instantaneous, but it is very fast,
taking no more than a minute and feeling very much like riding a long,
winding slide. 

The hole stays open for ten minutes, and it is possible to travel back
to the starting place (but nowhere else) by again jumping in feet-first.

Rapunzel Leaf

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Small green leaf from a rapunzel plant

Effect: After being buried beneath a rock, the rapunzel leaf begins to
grow into a stone tower that stands 100 feet (30 m) tall. The tower,
which takes ten minutes to fully form, has a large number of windows but
only one exterior door, which can be unlocked only by the user.

The tower’s level is equal to the cypher level, and the structure is
permanent and immobile.

Rose of Red

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Big, beautiful crimson rose in full bloom

Effect: Pricking a finger on the rose’s thorns causes the user to bleed
a single drop of blood. When flung into the air, the blood becomes a
large red bird that flies toward a chosen target up to a long distance
away. When it arrives, it bursts in an immediate radius, inflicting
Intellect damage equal to the cypher level. The burst spawns 1d6
additional birds; in the next round, each one flies to a random spot
within short range and explodes in an immediate radius, inflicting
damage equal to the cypher level.

Shadow Soap

Level: 4

Form: Small piece of soap

Effect: When rubbed on your visible shadow, causes it to separate from
yourself.

The shadow acts as a level 4 creature under the user’s control for one
hour (or until there is no light). The shadow is two-dimensional and
insubstantial, and when sneaking, hiding, and avoiding detection, it
acts as a level 7 creature. When the effect ends, the shadow (usually)
returns to the user.

Shadows are known to develop a mind of their own. Sometimes after
tasting a bit of freedom, they refuse to return.

Shard of the Moon

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Tiny sliver of the moon

Effect: Glows softly for ten minutes, drawing all moon-loving creatures
(such as moths, moon hares, and werewolves) within long range. For as
long as the effect lasts, any attracted creatures will not attack the
user or their allies. The user can converse with the creatures and ask
them questions, which the creatures will answer to the best of their
ability, but always within their nature (so a trickster will still
answer as a trickster would, for example).

Shining Knife

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Shining knife

Effect: When stuck into an object, such as a tree or the side of a
house, the knife connects the wielder and someone they choose. If one of
them wants to know how the other is faring, all they have to do is
return to the spot where the knife is stuck. If both are faring well,
the knife shines bright gold. If harm has come to one, the knife is dull
and rusted.

Silver Slippers

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Silver shoes, ruby slippers, or red boots

Effect: When the wearer speaks aloud the name of the place they wish to
go,

the silver slippers take them there in three steps. Note that in most
cases the slippers only transport the wearer (although companion animals
and the like may sometimes travel with them).

Once the silver slippers are used to transport their wearer, they
disappear. However,

it is rumored that they magically return to the world in some form for
someone else who needs them.

Singing Bone

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Human bone carved into the mouthpiece for a musical instrument
Effect: When blown into, the bone sings a

song that details the weaknesses and faults of one target (up to the
level of the cypher) that the user chooses. For ten minutes, all tasks
involving the target are eased for everyone in long range who heard the
bone’s song.

For most magical objects involving sound, it’s not necessary to
physically hear the item in order to gain the benefits. “Hearing” may
involve sensing vibrations, magical mental telepathy, a sign language
interpreter, and so on.

Snake Leaves

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Three green leaves

Effect: When placed upon a person, the leaves restore all Pools to full,
move

a character one step up the damage track, or bring a dead character back
to life. However, the character also gains a permanent 3-point reduction
in their maximum Intellect Pool.

Snickersnee

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Small jewel, talisman, or bead 

Effect: When attached to a weapon, causes it to grow two to five times
its normal size. The weapon inflicts an additional +2 points of damage,
but otherwise can be used as if it were a weapon of its original size.

Song of the Dead

Level: 1d6

Form: Small stuffed bird with yellow and blue plumage

Effect: When the user spends ten minutes breathing into the mouth of the
bird, it comes to life. It flies off, but now carries a piece of the
user’s life inside it. When the user dies, the bird flies back to their
body and is able to communicate to those around it, but only for one
day. After that, the bird returns to its lifeless form.

Sorcerer’s Skeleton Key

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Wooden stick, iron wand, or piece of straw

Effect: When tapped three times against any locked door or other object
(of the cypher level or lower), the key automatically unlocks it.

Spirit Ring

Level: 1d6

Form: Ring, necklace, hairpin, or bracelet 

Effect: Summons a group of helpful fey who provide assistance for ten
minutes. During this time, they do as the wearer commands as long as
they’re within long range. They can hinder any or all opponents’ tasks,
provide information, assist in small tasks, and so on. The fey will not
do anything that goes against their basic nature and safety (such as
self-harm, attacking their friends, or obvious suicide missions).

Fey are fickle beings. While spirit rings and the like allow someone to
hold power over them, it’s very much dependent on the fey’s blessing.
Angering the fey may cause them to leave at any moment (even in the
middle of something important), and they may take the time to curse or
prank the characters before they disappear.

Teleport Hat

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Silly hat that is always too large on the wearer no matter what
size their head is

Effect: Allows the wearer to wish for a creature that they know to
appear at their side. The creature must agree to be teleported (or
convinced via some type of interaction, such as persuasion or
intimidation). The teleported creature stays for as long as both parties
agree, but not more than a day. At that time, the creature is returned
to their place of origination.

Three Needles

Level: 1d6

Form: Three enchanted needles

Effect: For the next ten minutes per cypher level, the user can climb
any solid surfaces (even vertical ones) as if doing so was a routine
task.

Tin Man’s Tears

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Tiny vial filled with tears

Effect: When poured out, spreads out to cover an area about 2 feet by 2
feet (60 cm square), transforming any metal it touches into brittle
rust, down to a depth of about 6 inches (15 cm). When used on a metal
creature (such as a tin soldier), the rust inflicts damage equal to the
cypher’s level and hinders all movement actions for ten minutes.

To Peter With Love

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Wrapped box with a bomb inside and a gift tag on the outside

Effect: Write a person’s name on the tag, and the box will deliver
itself to that person at a time and place you specify. When opened, the
box does damage to the recipient equal to the cypher level. Traveling to
the recipient takes at least a round and sometimes longer, depending on
the distance and difficulty.

Valorous Whetstone

Level: 1d6

Form: Sharpening stone

Effect: After sharpening at least one of their weapons with the
whetstone, the user instantly feels more brave. For the next ten
minutes, all of their intimidation actions are eased, and their
sharpened weapon inflicts +2 points of damage.

Vase of Tears

Level: 1d6

Form: Vase, vial, or jar filled with tears 

Effect: Breaking the vase creates a protective spell around the
character, preventing them from taking any Might damage the next time
they are physically attacked.

White Snake

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Piece of a magical snake

Effect: Upon swallowing the piece of the snake, the user gains the
ability to understand and speak with all living things for ten minutes.

Wish-Granting Pearl

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Flaming pearl

Effect: The user can make a single wish and have all or part of it come
true. The GM assigns a level to the wish, so the larger and more
difficult the wish, the more difficult it is to have the wish granted.
Generally, a wish such as gaining an asset or inexpensive item is level
1, and a wish for an expensive item or for a foe to vanish is level 7.
The cypher cannot grant a wish above its level.

Witch Bottle

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Ornate stoppered bottle filled with wine, seawater, or pins and
needles 

Effect: Captures a witch (of a level up to the cypher’s level). Upon
entering the bottle, the witch takes damage equal to the cypher’s level
and is trapped until someone whispers their name into the bottle’s mouth
and releases them.

Witch’s Ladder

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Garland of knotted string, feathers, teeth, and bells

Effect: Safely stores one curse for use at a later time. The stored
curse may be released and cast only by the person who stored it, or by
someone who has received their permission to do so.

Wooden Spoon

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Plain wooden spoon

Effect: When stirred through the air, restores the user’s energy and
vitality. The user gains two additional actions on their next turn. For
example, they can move a long distance, use a one-action recovery roll,
and activate a cypher as their turn, or attack a foe three times.

Yonder Yarn

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Skein or spool of yarn

Effect: Unravels to lead the user to their desired destination. The yarn
unspools at the speed that the user would normally walk or ride. The
yonder yarn will not enter territory it deems too dangerous, and it
cannot go through solid obstacles. If the yarn is cut, it no longer
works.

It is difficult, but not impossible, to protect oneself from being found
by yonder yarn. Witches, in particular, know ways to hide themselves
(and others) from the yarn’s power.

ARTIFACTS

Most artifacts in a Cypher System fairy tale setting are magical objects
that have been either crafted via magic or later altered by or imbued
with magic. There are a number of people and beings in fairy tale
settings who are capable of creating artifacts by one or both of these
methods. Additionally, some artifacts are products of magic or the
setting itself. Thus, new artifacts are constantly entering the world,
just waiting to be found and used by the characters.

ARTIFACT QUIRKS

Magic runs through most items in a fairy tale world, but especially
through artifacts. Magic is unknowable and mystifying, and thus
something can—and often does—go wrong. While that may sometimes manifest
as GM intrusions, it also shows up in artifacts as quirks. Every
artifact has a quirk that sets it apart from mundane or lightly magical
objects.

Quirks typically do not make an artifact more powerful, but they can
make it more interesting, difficult, useful, or just unique. Some quirks
manifest during an item’s creation, while others might appear (or
disappear) after a particular experience, usually one involving magic.
Quirks may come and go without notice, but typically an artifact can
have only one quirk at a time and is rarely without a quirk for long.

A SELECTION OF FAIRY TALE ARTIFACTS 

A Tisket a Tasket

Level: 1d6

Form: Woven yellow basket with wooden handles

Effect: This basket can contain up to one cypher per artifact level, as
long as each is no larger than a typical cat. Cyphers in the basket do
not count against a character’s limit.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each time a cypher is added to the basket)

Bounding Boots

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Beautifully made leather and gold boots that adjust to fit the
wearer perfectly

Effect: The boots are an asset for jumping and running (easing one of
these skills by two steps if the artifact is level 6 or higher). 

Depletion: —

Boundless Bag

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Small bag with two handles and a clasp

Effect: Any nonliving item held in the bag becomes a slightly more
valuable item. For example, an inexpensive item becomes a moderately
priced item, while a moderate item becomes an expensive item. The bag
has no effect on items that are very expensive or exorbitant. The change
takes a full day to take effect, during which time the item cannot leave
the bag and the bag should not be opened. If the bag is opened, the
process is canceled and must be started over.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6. When the effect depletes, it can still be used as a
normal bag.

Putting all or part of

a living thing into a boundless bag is always risky, as more than one
person has had their hand or head turned to gold (which might sound
lovely, but typically isn’t). Also, doing so often causes the boundless
bag to revert to a normal bag.

Items that create wealth in any fashion are particularly sought after.
So much so that some items are believed to be cursed, due to the number
of people who have met their untimely fate while in possession of a
wealth-making artifact.

Boy Blue’s Horn

Level: 1d6

Form: Gleaming horn that never needs to be tuned or polished

Effect: When playing a lullaby, the horn puts every hearing living being
in short range (including the user) to sleep for two rounds. When the
horn plays something upbeat, the user and all allies within short range
add +1 to their recovery rolls for ten minutes.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20. After depletion, it continues to function as a
regular horn.

Carving Knife of Sharpness

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Knife (light weapon)

Effect: This weapon functions as a normal knife of its kind. When the
wielder gets a special major effect when attacking, they can choose to
lop off one of the target’s limbs.

Depletion: 1 in 1d10 (roll on each major effect)

The GM determines the effect of a lost limb; however, many magical
beings can withstand lost limbs with far more aplomb than a mortal
creature will display in a similar situation.

Devils and Tailors

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Blood-stained draughtboard with figures of white gold, bronze, and
pearl 

Effect: Playing someone in a game of checkers or draughts eases all of
the user’s positive social interactions with their opponent. While
playing, the user can make a move and interact with their opponent as a
single action. The game lasts a number of rounds equal to the artifact
level.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each game played). After depletion, the
board continues to function as a regular draughtboard.

You can determine the outcome of a game by having both players roll 2d6.
The player with the highest number of pieces left on the board (highest
roll) is the winner.

Fiddle of the Fossegrim

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Water-worn fiddle

Effect: Playing the fiddle causes everyone within long distance to
become enticed by the music and draw closer to the player. After one
round, all creatures in short range begin to dance uncontrollably for a
number of rounds equal to the artifact level. The only action they can
take while dancing is to attempt to break free from the effect (an
Intellect action equal to the artifact level).

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Fortunate’s Purse

Level: 1d6

Form: Elegant knapsack that shifts colors to hide in plain sight

Effect: Any object put inside the sack cannot be detected by physical
senses or magic. The sack can hold a single item, of any size and shape,
at a time. Cyphers in Fortunate’s purse do not count against the user’s
cypher limit.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each time an item is added to the knapsack)

Magic bags come in many forms, such as coin purses, sacks, packs, and
pockets. Some can be used to hide someone safely out of sight, provide
an endless supply of gold or riches, or grant wishes. They are most
often given as rewards for doing great kindnesses or completing a
difficult task.

Galoshes of Fortune

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Pair of rubber boots

Effect: Transports the wearer to a time and place in the past or present
that they desire for up to ten minutes. The wearer cannot be seen,
heard, or sensed by others, and they cannot take any actions other than
to watch events unfold. Traveling to and from the time and place causes
the wearer to disappear from the present for two rounds.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6

Genie’s Lamp

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Bronze oil lamp

Effect: Rubbing the lamp produces a genie who grants the user a wish.
The GM assigns a level to the wish, so the larger and more difficult the
wish, the more difficult it is to have the wish granted. Generally, a
wish such as gaining an asset or inexpensive item is level 1, and a wish
for an expensive item or for a foe to vanish is level 7. The genie
cannot grant a wish above its level. The genie can grant only one wish
per day. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d6

Genies, also called djinn or jinn, come in many forms, and not all of
them are contained or controlled by something so simple as a lamp.

Golden Bridle

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Bridle made of flowing gold

Effect: To activate the bridle, the user must succeed on an Intellect
interaction with a beast whose level does not exceed the artifact level.
The bridle bonds to the creature, which immediately becomes calm. The
creature awaits the user’s commands and carries out orders

to the best of its ability. The creature remains calmed for a number of
hours equal to the artifact’s level minus the creature’s level. (If the
result is 0 or less, the creature is enslaved for only one minute.)

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

Hatchet of the Woodsman

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Well-worn hatchet of unremarkable appearance

Effect: When used on a creature, the hatchet turns the target into wood
and inflicts damage equal to its level. If the creature is living wood,
the hatchet turns them into nonliving wood. If the target is slain by
the hatchet, the creature becomes animated wood. Effects last for ten
minutes or until the target succeeds on an Intellect roll.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check on each successful attack)

Hook’s Hook

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Simple iron hook designed to be worn as a prosthetic

Effect: When placed on an amputated limb, the hook grafts on
permanently. It works

as a simple hook and as a light weapon. When activated, Hook’s hook
affects the

minds of all thinking foes within long range. Those affected are
instilled with terror, making them drop whatever they’re holding and
flee for a number of rounds equal to the artifact level.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (for the fear ability). After depletion, it still
functions as a hook and a weapon.

There are rumored to be any number of Hook’s hooks, all of which are
made from different materials and serve different purposes, such as the
scissors hook, oar hook, magnet hook, teacup hook, grappling-hook hook,
and fishing rod hook. Enterprising characters might seek out multiple
hooks, along with a way to exchange them easily.

Horn of Destruction

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Large brass horn

Effect: Blowing into the horn destroys all objects in an immediate area
that is up to a long distance away, turning it all into rubble and
debris. Living beings inside the area take 2 points of ambient damage
(ignores Armor).

Depletion: 1 in 1d6

It is customary for the one who holds the horn of destruction to call
themselves the King of Rubble and Debris and to wear a crown fashioned
from talus and scree.

Iron Stove

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Iron stove that walks and talks 

Effect: Once per day, the stove can bake a

living gingerbread cookie. The baker chooses the form, but it must be a
simple, one-dimensional shape (such as a human, a dog, or a tree). The
cookie is a level 3 creature that can move, talk, and complete simple
tasks that the baker asks of it. After a day, the cookie crumbles away.

Additionally, the iron stove can be used as a regular stove to heat
water, cook meals, and so on.

Depletion: 1 in 1d100. After depletion, it remains a regular working
stove, but no longer walks and talks.

A gingerbread being is not immune to dangers. Large amounts of liquids
are likely to make it melt away, while birds and other scavengers have
been known to try to take an eye or leg.

Knapsack of Sevens

Level: 1d6

Form: Simple knapsack

Effect: Tapping the knapsack seven times causes seven swans to fly out.
For as long as the user does not speak or make any sounds, the swans fly
around the user, providing them with +1 Armor against mental and
physical attacks for the next ten minutes.

As soon as the user utters a sound, the swans return to the knapsack.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Mirror Mirror

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Ornate mirror that grows or shrinks in size according to its
user’s needs. 

Effect: When the user looks into the mirror and interacts with it, it
grants their request, as it is able. Roll a d6 to determine the mirror’s
ability:

Most mirror mirrors have a personality all their own. Some sing their

answers, some show images, and still others sigh with boredom at being
asked the same thing over and over.

Mirrors never lie. Except when they do.

Pandora’s Box

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Elegant gold box with a hinged lid and a locked clasp

Effect: When the box is opened, light leaks out. The light coalesces
into a golden form that represents a deep sense of peace and hope to the
person who opened the box. For a number of rounds equal to the artifact
level, the golden form eases all actions taken by the opener.
Alternatively, the opener can share the effect of the golden form as
their action, easing all actions taken by allies within short range (but
not giving themselves the benefits).

Depletion: 1 in 1d6

Pixie Dust

Level: 1d6

Form: Glass bottle filled with glittering light 

Effect: Shake the glittering light on a living

being and it can fly for ten minutes per artifact level. If the being
can already fly, shaking the light on them grounds them, taking away
their ability to be airborne for the same amount of time.

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

Red Cap

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Woolen cap soaked in human blood 

Effect: The wearer gains an extra recovery

roll each day that is not an action and does not count toward their
daily limit. Once the wearer uses this recovery roll, they can’t do so
again until after they make a ten-hour recovery roll and soak the hat in
fresh human blood.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each day of use)

Red Riding Hood

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Bright red cloak that adjusts to fit its wearer

Effect: Draws the eye while also giving the wearer the impression of
being easy prey. All tasks involving sneaking and hiding are hindered,
and foes will typically attack the wearer over any others in the area.
The cloak provides +3 Armor and an asset to all Might-based tasks,
including combat tasks.

Depletion: 1 in 1d10 (check each day of use)

Self-Swinging Sword

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Steel sword with an ornate hilt 

Effect: When activated by a special word,

the sword attacks whoever the user indicates, fighting as a creature
whose level is equal to the artifact level. Commanding the sword is not
an action, but it can only do things that a sword would be able to do
(attack, block, slice, and so on). If the sword is reduced to 0 health,
the self-swinging ability ends and must be reactivated. The sword
returns to the user when the duration ends.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (for the self-swinging ability). After depletion, it
functions as a regular sword.

Seven-League Boots

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Lace-up knee-high boots of black leather

Effect: Allows the wearer to travel up to 21 miles (34 km) with a single
step. Alternatively, two people may each wear one boot and travel up to
10.5 miles (19 km) with a single step. Seven-league boots exhaust the
user, costing them 2 Might points per step.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each step). Once the movement ability
depletes, the boots continue to function as regular boots.

Shapeshifter Wand

Level: 1d6

Form: Wand made of wood, glass, metal, or stone

Effect: Allows the user to turn one living being (including themself)
into one of the following: flower, lake, duck, swan, cottage, rosebush,
or fish. While in

their new form, the shapeshifted being retains all of their health and
other attributes, but cannot perform any actions beyond what the
non-magical item or creature could normally perform. So a flower can
blow in the wind, bloom, attract insects, be cut, and smell nice. Any
attempts to detect the shapeshifted being by physical senses or magic
are hindered by two steps. While shapeshifted, the being cannot die;
however, they can be injured, cursed, or moved down the damage track.
The effect lasts for ten minutes or until the user chooses to end it
early.

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

She-Bear

Level: 1d6

Form: Bit of wood carved in the shape of a bear

Effect: When placed in the mouth, changes the wielder into the form of a
female bear. While in this form, the user gains +4 to their Might Pool,
+4 to their Speed Pool, and +1 to Armor. They also can communicate with
other bears while in this form. The effect lasts for ten minutes.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6

Shirt of Nettles

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Woven shirt of stinging nettles 

Effect: The shirt acts as light armor, but grants an additional +2 Armor
(+3 if the artifact is level 9 or higher) in addition to the 1 Armor
that light armor typically provides. Additionally, the wearer can’t be
shapeshifted against their will.

Depletion: — (At any time, the GM can rule that the shirt has resisted
enough shapeshifting magic to deplete that ability, after which the
shirt still functions as armor.)

Soldier’s Cloak of Invisibility

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Slate-grey cloak sewn of shadows and silence

Effect: Provides an asset to hiding, sneaking, and remaining undetected
(even by magic) for as long as the wearer does not interact with another
creature. Entering into combat or interacting with another creature in
any way breaks the effect.

Depletion: 1 in 1d100

Soulful Fiddle

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Fiddle made of bone and guts 

Effect: This instrument acts like a normal

fiddle of its kind. If the wielder is trained in its use and plays an
appropriate tune, those within short range who hear it suffer one of the
following effects: fall asleep, become amenable to suggestion, follow
the fiddle player in a light trance, or take a similar action.

The desired effect must be the same for all creatures who hear it. The
effect lasts for ten minutes, but actions by others (such as attacking
the listeners or physically restraining them) can end the effect early
for a creature.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 

Steadfast Tin Soldier

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Small tin soldier with one leg 

Effect: Gives a user who is missing a

limb the ability to transform the tin soldier into a prosthetic limb
with the appearance of their choosing. The limb permanently increases
the user’s maximum Speed Pool or Might Pool (user’s choice) by 5 points
(or 7 points if the artifact is level 6 or higher).

Depletion: —

It is rumored that there are a number of artifacts that create
prosthetic body parts or restore missing limbs, including Paper
Ballerina, Handless Maiden, and Bianca’s Snake.

Stone Canoe

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Shiny grey pebble, small enough to fit into a pocket

Effect: When activated, forms into a canoe that can carry a number of
beings (and their equipment) equal to the artifact level. The canoe
lasts for one day and then transforms back into a pebble.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (check each use)

Story Knife

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Small penknife inscribed with tiny words in hundreds of languages 

Effect: Slices through words that are in the form of oral stories,
songs, speeches, conversations, and so on. This has one of two effects,
depending on the wielder’s desire (the wielder must decide before they
activate the artifact each time):

• Makes the story, song, and so on sharper, stronger, and more
interesting, increasing the chance that it will have an impact on
listeners (eases any attempted interaction task)

• Makes the story, song, and so on boring, unwieldy, and disjointed,
decreasing the chance that it will have the intended impact on listeners
(hinders any attempted interaction task)

Using the story knife is an action. It has no power to cut physical
objects or living beings (unless those beings are made of stories).

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Table-Be-Set

Level: 1d6

Form: Common-looking wooden table 

Effect: Putting the table out and saying

“Table be set” automatically fills the table with as much food and drink
as will fit upon its surface. The table does not become empty as long as
there is anyone in long range who still wishes to eat. Once a character
uses the table’s ability, they can’t do so again until after they make a
ten-hour recovery roll.

Depletion: 1 in 1d100

In addition to artifact quirks, common sense suggests that the

effects of some artifacts will draw additional interesting opportunities
or dangers. Using table-be-set in the middle of a forest, for example,
is likely to draw bears and other hungry beasts, while using it in the
middle of town might garner the characters new friends, or catch the
attention of thieves.

Tinderbox

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Small ornate tinderbox made of metal 

Effect: Summons three dogs to do the user’s bidding. The dogs can
complete any tasks dogs would normally be able to accomplish, including
carrying, fetching, attacking, defending, and so on. They act as a
single level 3 creature.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6

Tweedledee’s Umbrella

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Large umbrella with a sharp point on the end

Effect: Touch a creature (up to the artifact’s level) of any size and
the umbrella will fold up around it, capturing it inside. Holding the
umbrella with the captive inside is an action. A caught character is
held for ten minutes or until they make a successful Might roll to break
free.

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

Vicious Tankard

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Hefty ale tankard carved of stone 

Effect: In addition to serving as a convenient means to drink a variety
of liquids, if the tankard is topped off with good ale or spirits, it
can be used as a medium weapon that inflicts +2 damage (for a total of 6
points of damage). Anyone who picks up the tankard is practiced

in using it in this fashion. Surprisingly, using the tankard as a melee
weapon does not cause more than a modicum of good ale or spirits to
slosh out.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each fight)

BEASTS AND BEINGS

The following creatures and characters are provided to help populate
your fairy tale game. 

Generally, the listings in this book work much the same way as they do
for all Cypher System creature listings—the standard template includes
the level, description, motive, environment, and so on.

The most important element of each creature is its level. You use the
level to determine the target number a PC must reach to attack, defend
against, or otherwise interact with a creature or NPC. In each entry,
the difficulty number for the creature is listed in parentheses after
its level.

A creature’s target number is usually also its health, which is the
amount of damage it can sustain before it is dead or incapacitated. For
easy reference, most entries list a creature’s health, and they always
do so if it’s different from the normal amount for a creature of its
level.

For more detailed information on how to use level, health, combat, and
other elements, see the Understanding the Listings section in the Cypher
System Rulebook.

Due to the dual and complex nature of many creatures in fairy tales,
along with the large number of archetypes, there are several additional
elements that you’ll want to take particular note of when using the
creature listings.

A creature’s health is always equal to its target number unless
otherwise stated.

Suggested Additional Creatures for Use in Fairy Tale Settings

Talking Objects

If you have a talking object in your game, it has a level (just like
creatures and regular objects), and every interaction with it is based
on that level. Its level can be based on

its physical and mental complexity as well as its purpose. So something
like a singing teapot might be level 2 with 2 Armor, and it can hurl its
lid at a foe to inflict 2 points of damage. A complicated talking lock
who guards a precious treasure might be level 5 or 6 and can cast a
spell (inflicting 3 points of damage) on anyone who tries to pick it.

Some abilities in the game work only on objects, or only on creatures,
or only on living things. A talking object might or might not be living,
depending on its nature.

OF BITE AND CLAW (CREATURES)

The creatures in this section all appear to be animal in their nature,
from black dogs and big bad wolves to horses and snarks.

Bagheera: This cunning, bold, and brilliant black panther can be
someone’s worst enemy or their most loyal friend, protector, and mentor.

Level 7; stalking, hunting, sneaking,

and chasing prey as level 8; persuasion and positive social interactions
as level 8; inflicts 6 points of damage with teeth and claws; can pounce
on a victim from a long distance away to inflict 7 points of damage and
knock the victim prone.

Beast (with a capital B): Sometimes a human cursed, sometimes an animal
blessed, often just a creature from the beginning, Beasts are bestial
humanoids with large claws and jaws. Most Beasts have a single thing
that they love deeply and will do anything to protect: a garden, a
human, their home, a book from their childhood.

Level 6, intimidation and protection as level 7; Armor 2; inflicts 4
points of damage with an item related to their beloved (gardening
shears, for example).

Cheshire Cat: Interacting with this riddling, punning, disappearing
striped cat is enough to make anyone feel discombobulated. Can make a
great ally if you’re seeking answers, have lost your way, or need
advice.

Level 6, punning and wordplay as level 7, Speed defense as level 8 due
to intangibility; will disappear rather than fight.

Puss in Boots: Smart and smart-alecky, Puss in Boots always has a plan
in motion, and at least two others that are about to begin.

Level 5; planning, scheming, persuasion, and deception as

level 7; Armor 2; inflicts 4 points of damage with elaborate swordplay.

Black Dog 6 (18)

Black dogs go by many names: hellhounds, bearers of death, black hounds
of destiny, and devil dogs, just to name a few. Typically they are
spectral or demonic entities that show up at night. They are often
sinister, malevolent, or purposefully harmful (such as the Barghest and
Black Shuck). Occasionally, black dogs are helpful and benevolent,
guarding people from danger, helping them find the correct path, or
signifying the death of someone nearby.

Black dogs are usually large, shaggy, and as black as night, with long
ears and tails. However, despite their name, they can be any color. The
real distinction is that they are definitely not regular, living dogs.
Some have eyes like fire, some howl with a ghostly, ethereal song, and
still others have telltale witches’ marks upon their chest or back.

Black dogs can see ghosts, witches, and other magical entities not
typically visible to other creatures. They are sometimes a portent of
death, but not always. Many carry with them an inherent sense of sadness
and despair, which they can pass on to those around them. 

Black dogs sometimes serve as familiars for witches and sorcerers.

Motive: Bring harm and pain; help and guard

Environment: Crossroads, places of execution, and ancient paths Health:
20

Damage Inflicted: 8 points

Armor: 2

Movement: Long; very long when running

Modifications: Sneaking, hiding, and attacking from surprise or
advantage as level 7 Combat: Malevolent black dogs will attack from a
position of surprise or advantage,

inflicting 8 points of damage with their spectral teeth and claws. Some
black dogs cause such a deep feeling of despair and sadness, just by
being nearby, that they inflict 2 points of Intellect damage each round
on everyone who can see them or otherwise sense their presence.

Interaction: Running, at least from the malevolent ones, is typically
the best course

of action. Dealing with helpful black dogs is often an interesting and
unexpected

experience, as they don’t talk and don’t explain who they choose to help
or why. 

Use: The characters are fighting an extremely tough foe when a black dog
steps in to

help them out (or to help their foe). The characters are lost in the
woods, and a large,

menacing black dog steps out of the forest and leads them back to
safety.

Loot: Black dogs rarely have anything valuable on them. However, killing
a black dog causes

it to haunt whoever dealt it the fatal blow. That person feels such deep
anxiety and despair that all their actions are hindered for at least one
day, and often longer.

GM intrusions: The black dog howls, creating such a mournful sound that
everyone in very long distance who can hear it takes 4 points of
Intellect damage. A character who sees the black dog is deeply affected
by sadness and moves one step down the damage track.

Cat Sidhe 4 (12)

Cat sidhes, sometimes called phantom cats, are dog-sized felines that
were once witches and now have shifted permanently into cat form.
They’re all black except for a single white symbol on their chest, which
is their name.

When cat sidhes form (because a witch has turned themselves into a cat
for the ninth time), they gain nine tails. Each time a cat sidhe would
be killed, they can choose to lose one of their tails instead. Once a
cat sidhe has no more tails remaining, their death is final. 

While cat sidhes inflict damage with their soul-stealing attacks, the
roleplaying element of a character losing part of their soul is possibly
more important than the game effect. Consider removing something from
the character that will affect them in interesting and unusual ways.

Motive: Steal souls, gain power

Environment: Highlands, mountains, and forests

Health: 15

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Movement: Long

Modifications: Speed defense as level 6 due to quickness and agility

Combat: Cat sidhes can attack with their claws for 6 points of damage,
but they much

prefer to engage from a long distance, using their unique ability to
cast curses that steal part or all of a victim’s soul. They may attack a
foe using the following types of soul-stealing curses. Characters who
succeed on an Intellect defense roll resist the effect, but take 1 point
of Intellect damage due to the effort. If someone can read the symbol on
the cat’s chest and pronounce it, they gain +1 Armor against the cat’s
attacks.

Falter. Removes a favored part of the creature’s personality, such as
their sense of humor, courage, or kindness. The creature doesn’t forget
that they had that part of their personality; they just can’t remember
how to access it again. All social interactions are hindered.

Fester. Replaces a piece of the character’s soul with an idea, false
memory, or thought that, once placed, grows into something insidious and
dangerous inside them. The character takes no damage at the time, but
each time they make a recovery roll, they take 2 points of Intellect
damage.

Forget. Removes something from the creature’s memory, such as all nouns
(including their own name), a loved one’s face, their current purpose,
an ability, or a skill. This inflicts 3 points of Intellect damage and
causes the character to forget the specific thing.

Interaction: Having once been witches, cat sidhes are smart, cunning,
and dangerous. Most have no interest in conversations or bargains,
unless they are injured in some way. They

can, however, sometimes be distracted from their purpose of stealing
souls by riddles, music, and children’s games.

Use: A cat sidhe stalks a forest where the characters are passing
through on their way elsewhere. Someone sends the characters to capture
a “lost” cat, which turns out to be a cat sidhe.

Loot: When a cat sidhe dies, it disappears, leaving behind only the
once-white symbol on its chest in the form of a medallion.

GM intrusion: The cat sidhe yowls, causing a second cat sidhe to appear
from hiding

Satyr 5 (15)

These muscular humanoids sport long curved horns and furry, hooved legs.
They are self-centered, greedy, and sybaritic creatures, dedicated to
food, drink, and other pleasures. They rob and steal from others as it
pleases them, often relying on tricks and lies, or on alluring music
they play on pipes.

Motive: Play tricks, gather treasure, fulfill desires

Environment: In woodlands where other faerie or mythological creatures
are found

Health: 18

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short

Modifications: Tasks related to persuasion and deception as level 7;
resists mental attacks as level 7

Combat: Satyrs usually carry spears that they can use in melee and
against foes within short range.

Satyrs can also create magical effects by playing their pipes as an
action, which can either bolster allies or harm enemies. 

Dance of the Leaping Stag: Foes within short range who fail an Intellect
defense task lose their next turn dancing and leaping. Attacks made
against affected targets are eased by one step.

Feral Overture: An ally within short range is infused with magic. One
attack it makes on its next turn is eased by one step, and if it hits,
it inflicts +3 damage.

Tune of the Clouded Mind: A foe within short range who fails an
Intellect defense task spends its next turn attacking one of its allies.

Interaction: A satyr is always willing to start negotiations, but is
prone to lying and exaggeration. Offering excessive libation, food, and
other treasures is the only way to ensure a satyr remains honest, if
only for a short period.

Use: Strange piping music in the forest lures away young men and women
from a nearby community. The elders say a charismatic cult leader has
set up in the woods, and clouds the minds of all who come near.

Loot: A satyr is likely to carry

GM intrusion: If the character fails an Intellect defense task, they
think of the satyr as a good friend for up to one minute or until they
can escape the mental effect.

Snark 7 (21)

The snark is unimaginable. It is a Boojum, you see. An agony in eight
fits. Part snail and shark and bark and snake and snarl. It has feathers
that bite, claws that catch, and jaws that snatch. It softly and
suddenly vanishes away, never to be met with again. It smells of the
will-o-wisp, sleeps late in the day, and breathes fire when it finds
something funny (which is nearly never).

Motive: Unfathomable

Environment: Upon islands filled with chasms and crags, near bathing
machines, and around those whose coats are too tight in the waist
Health: 21

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Armor: 2

Movement: Short when moving perpendicular; long when moving sideways 

Modifications: Invisibility, shapeshifting, confusion, and mimsy as
level 8

Combat: Inflicts 5 points of damage with biting feathers, catching
claws, and snatching jaws. Also blows out a stream of fire that can
light a match or inflict 3 points of damage to everyone in close range.

Interaction: Not recommended.

Use: The characters are given the impossible task of hunting a snark.
Whether or not they actually find one, they have grand adventures along
the way.

Loot: The frabjous joy of catching the impossible, improbable,
unimaginable snark.

GM intrusion: Everything about the snark is a GM intrusion.

Wolf, Big Bad 8 (24)

The Big Bad Wolf (just call him the Wolf, for he is truly the only one
worthy of that title) is a beast of near immortality, kept alive by the
legends that swirl around him, the constant stream of terrorizing tales.
Once the stalker of the woods, now he stalks the streets and towns, no
longer staying to the shadows, no longer merely hunting girls and
grandmothers. As his reputation has grown, so has his appetite. He
hungers. He swallows worlds. He will not be contained. 

Motive: Hunger

Environment: Woods, cities, behind you

Health: 30

Damage Inflicted: 8 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Long

Modifications: Hunting, seeking, and sneaking as level 9

Combat: The Wolf ’s bite does 8 points of damage. Additionally, he has a
variety of abilities that he may use.

What Big Ears You Have: Can track and hear his prey up to a mile away.
Tracking ignores all cloaking abilities, including magical ones.

What Big Eyes You Have: Mesmerizes his victims for two rounds,
convincing them that he is a friend and that they should do what he
suggests.

What Big Teeth You Have: Swallows his victim whole, holding them in his
belly. It’s a level 8 Speed or Might defense task to avoid being eaten
whole. Captured characters can attempt to cut themselves free, which
requires three successful attacks.

Huff and Puff: Exhale creates a wind so strong it can knock over foes,
trees, and even houses. Inflicts 6 points of damage to everything within
long distance, and knocks most things prone. Once the Wolf uses this
ability, he can’t use it again for three rounds.

Interaction: Despite his constant hunger and his gnawing need to swallow
the world, the Wolf makes an interesting ally (provided that he’s well
fed at the time) for he is smart and cunning, and has myriad tricks for
moving through the world.

Use: The Big Bad Wolf is a great character to introduce into a modern
fairy tale game. Imagine his new iteration as an urban legend, spreading
through the internet.

GM intrusions: The Wolf makes a great leap, knocking down foes. The Wolf
already has someone swallowed in his belly, and that person calls for
help from out of the Wolf’s mouth.

CRAFTED (CREATURES)

Crafted creatures are those made by human, fey, or other hands. In fairy
tales these might include characters like Pinocchio,

the Iron Giant, Edward Scissorhands, the Gingerbread Man, and the Tin
Man.

Gingerbread Creatures

Gingerbread creatures can take any shape and form, but are most often
humans, dogs, or dragons. Typically crafted and brought to life by
witches and enchanters, gingerbread creatures tend to remain loyal to
their creators, even if they are treated poorly.

Level 2, Speed defense as level 4 due to quickness; when touched or
eaten, some gingerbread creatures release a sweet, slow poison that
inflicts 1 point of damage each round for 1d6 rounds.

Geppetto’s Children

Made of wood and wishes, Geppetto’s children are everywhere in the
world. They go through a number of life stages, starting as wooden
puppets and eventually becoming real humans. No matter what stage
they’re in, they’re nonstop sources of destruction and chaos.

Level 4; Armor 1; have a passion for creating, collecting, and using
cyphers, particularly detonation cyphers

Virgilius’s Copper Dogs

Once the loyal companions of Virgilius the Sorcerer, this pack of dogs
now runs feral. Despite being created through the power of magic, they
despise anything that stinks of magic and attempt to bring it down.

Level 5; Armor 2

Tin Woodman 7 (21)

Once an ordinary woodman of flesh and blood named Nick Chopper, the Tin
Woodman’s story is a sad one. His beloved axe was enchanted by a wicked
witch in order to keep him from his other true love (it’s a long story,
but suffice it to say that witches who are wicked do wicked things). His
beloved axe turned on Nick Chopper, taking off one limb after another. A
tinsmith kindly replaced Nick’s missing body parts (except his heart)
with tin prosthetics, but eventually nothing was left of the original
human and he became the Tin Woodman.

Note that the Tin Woodman will never tell you this story himself, for he
has no heart and seeks only revenge: revenge upon the witch who cursed
him, upon the tinsmith who did not replace his heart, upon the rain that
rusts him. Someday, he will find all the original parts of himself, no
matter who they belong to currently, so that he can return to his
original form.

Motive: Revenge, find his original body parts 

Environment: Anywhere

Health: 21

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Armor: 4

Movement: Short; immediate if rusted Modifications: Speed defense as
level 5 due to rust

Combat: Inflicts 7 points of damage with his enchanted axe.

Interaction: The Tin Woodman is singularly focused, and cares only about
clues that lead to revenge or his original body parts. He does not eat,
drink, or sleep, and often comes across as frantic and frenzied.

Use: The PCs are hunting the same foe that the Tin Woodman is, and
either they join together, or the Tin Woodman tries to prevent them from
reaching the foe before he does.

Loot: Enchanted axe

Enchanted axe (artifact): level 7; inflicts 7 points of damage; can be
activated to move a long distance away from the wielder and attack a foe
as an action. Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each activation)

GM intrusion: A character’s weapon gets caught in the Tin Woodman’s
metal body, pulling the weapon out of their hands. 

Death 10 (infinite)

Death goes by many names, takes many forms, and has only one purpose: to
make all equal in the end. Death is often an unwanted visitor—taking the
life of someone who is not ready to go—but just as often, they come to
those who are ready. To them, Death is a most welcome, the most welcome,
guest of all.

While some see Death as evil, they are not inherently so, no more than
the cougar hunting the hare for dinner. In fact, they are the great
equalizer, raising paupers to kings and kings to common people.

Death is ancient, but not old. Wise, but not all-knowing. Brilliant, but
not perfect. Death is also, very often, bored. They have seen
everything, heard everything, and done everything that it is possible
for an immortal being to do, and some days they feel sure they will
never experience anything new or interesting again. But still, they try,
taking on new guises, hiding themselves away, even traveling to distant
stars and moons before their duties and obligations once again pull them
to return.

If Death appears at the foot of a person’s bed, that person can recover
if the proper steps are taken. If Death is at the head of the bed,
almost nothing can be done to save the victim, beyond an impossible
bargain.

Motive: To do their duty and make everyone equal

Environment: Everywhere and anywhere

Health: ∞

Damage Inflicted: Death

Armor: Immune to all harm

Movement: Variable depending on their form, but Death can move
instantaneously almost

anywhere that they desire

Modifications: Seeing through trickery, deception, or bargaining as
level 8

Combat: Death kills. They kill any number of ways, depending on their
mood, what’s at

hand, and how they believe the person should leave their life.
Thankfully, death only comes for someone when their time is up.

Still, it’s not considered wise to provoke or challenge Death to
physical combat, for there is only one outcome: a single attack from
Death kills the victim (except in the rare case where the victim has
protection against death, such as with one of Death’s candles).

Interaction: Death cannot be hurt and cannot be killed, but they can be
bargained with, bet against, and sometimes tricked. More rarely, they
have even been known to lose a bargain or be captured for a short period
of time.

Use: Bargaining with Death is a potential way to achieve an impossible
task or gain a very rare item, but of course it always comes with a
price (usually an earlier death for the bargainer or someone else).
Death is always looking for something interesting going on, and may
appear just to spend time with the characters if they’re engaged in an
intriguing activity.

GM intrusion: Death mistakes a character for someone else.

OF EARTH AND STONE (CREATURES)

Creatures of the earth are those that seem to belong to the land in some
unique and significant way. Perhaps they are made of the land and its
offerings—tree beings, rock trolls, and so on—or perhaps they seem
attached to the land in important ways, such as the way in which the
minotaur is part of its maze or the way that dwarves have a unique
connection to mountains.

Because the archetype of earth beings covers a broad range of creatures,
there is no general entry for an earth being.

Dwarf: level 4; Armor 2; mining pick inflicts 4 points of damage; beards
provide magical abilities such as finding treasure, enabling flight,
shapeshifting, and turning invisible. Cutting a dwarf’s beard off or
learning their name provides an asset on all interactions with that
dwarf.

Feral tree: level 3; Armor 3; no movement; lashing branches attack up to
three characters as a single action; on a failed Might defense task, the
characters are held in place until they can escape.

Troll: level 6; claws inflict 7 points of damage and grab victim until
they can escape; grabbed creature takes 10 points of damage per round;
troll regains 3 points of health per round.

Erlking 6 (18)

This vaguely humanoid creature is an animated accumulation of woodland
debris—bark, lost teeth, matted weeds, and dirt. It wears a crown of oak
leaves and a cloak of mist.

Its eyes are knotholes, and its hands are sharpened twigs. An erlking is
a greedy spirit of hunger deemed Unseelie by the faerie nobility of that
wild and wicked realm. Erlkings love to hunt and eat children, who are
particularly susceptible to the promises and glamours that the creatures
spin.

An erlking is a former noble stripped of title, lands, and even form,

and exiled into the night for crimes unimaginable in their cruelty. An
erlking’s victims are found in the cold sunlight, pale and bloodless,
with their vital organs nibbled out.

Motive: Hungers for flesh and to reclaim stripped titles 

Environment: Almost anywhere wooded at night Health: 27

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Armor: 4

Movement: Short; immediate when burrowing

Modifications: Stealth tasks as level 7

Combat: An erlking prefers to attack from hiding, and whisper a child or
other creature

within short distance from their bed out into the night if the victim
fails an Intellect defense task. An affected creature remains under the
erlking’s spell for up to an hour or until attacked or otherwise harmed.

When it attacks physically, an erlking can attack three times on its
turn with root tendrils. A target hit by a tendril must also succeed on
a Speed defense roll or become grabbed until they escape. The erlking
automatically inflicts 6 points of damage on each grabbed creature each
round until they succeed on a Might-based task to escape.

Silvered and cold iron weapons ignore an erlking’s Armor. If an
erlking’s remains are not burned or otherwise destroyed, it will sprout
and grow a new body from its corpse within a day.

Interaction: An erlking may negotiate if creatures have something it
wants, or if targets are armed with silvered or cold iron weapons.

Use: An erlking is active only by night; by day, it hides beneath a
mound of weedy earth indistinguishable from the surrounding terrain.

GM intrusion: A character surprised by an erlking in the darkness must
succeed on an Intellect defense task or lose their next action as they
faint, run screaming, or stand paralyzed in terror.

Minotaur, the 7 (21)

The most famous minotaur is the Minotaur, the singular beast from which
all lesser minotaur myths descend. The product of a god-cursed union
between human and bull,

the Minotaur is monstrous, and only the flesh of people can nourish it.
It is usually lost

in a labyrinth created to contain it. But it occasionally gets free to
hunt the wider world before the labyrinth pulls it back. Some demigods
claim to have slain the Minotaur, but the Minotaur always returns.

Motive: Hungers for flesh

Environment: Usually in mythological labyrinths, but sometimes
metaphorical ones Health: 33

Damage Inflicted: 10 points

Armor: 3

Movement: Short

Modifications: Breaking through barriers as level 9

Combat: The Minotaur attacks by goring foes on its horns, inflicting 10
points of damage

on a successful attack. If the Minotaur charges a short distance, it can
attack as part of

the same action and inflict an additional 5 points of damage.

The Minotaur is trapped by the labyrinth, but also part of it. Whenever
a character attacks

the Minotaur, they must succeed on an Intellect defense task or be
claimed by the labyrinth themselves until they can escape with a
successful difficulty 7 Intellect task. Those claimed by the labyrinth
seem to disappear and find themselves wandering a dark maze. Once a
character successfully escapes, they are no longer subject to being
claimed by the labyrinth for several days.

If killed, the Minotaur’s body is claimed by the labyrinth. Thirty-three
days later, the Minotaur is resuscitated.

Interaction: The Minotaur can speak, but usually chooses not to. It is
belligerent and cruel, and always hungry.

Use: The Minotaur has escaped the labyrinth and now wanders the narrow
streets of a metropolis, treating the winding alleys and twisting roads
as its new maze.

GM intrusion: The Minotaur smashes into the wall, causing a section of
the tunnel or hallway to collapse on the character(s), inflicting 10
points of damage and trapping them until they can escape the rubble

Enchanter 5 (15)

Enchanters include magic-users of all genders. They may choose to call
themselves wizards, sorcerers, mages, or diviners, depending on their
strengths, abilities, and desired reputations.

Enchanters usually take great pride in their appearance, including their
outfits, accouterments, and equipment. They often incorporate living or
dead elements of dangerous creatures, such as spiders, snakes,
crocodiles, and dragons, into the objects that matter to them.
Additionally, they may imbue objects with powerful magic.

Enchanters can use long-lasting or even permanent versions of their
magical abilities, but doing so usually requires minutes or hours of
time.

Most enchanters have one or more apprentices or helpers, typically
animals that have been made human temporarily or humans who are in the
service of the enchanter until some debt of theirs or their family’s has
been paid.

Sorcerer’s Apprentice: level 3

Motive: Control magic, power

Environment: Everywhere, particularly in places where magic is present
and powerful Health: 20

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Armor: 2

Movement: Short

Modifications: Using and controlling magic as level 7

Combat: Magical weapons and artifacts (such as a whip made of living
snakes, a staff with a

biting wolf’s head on top, or a sword that acts of its own accord) do 5
points of damage. Additionally, an enchanter may employ a number of
magical abilities, including the

Following:

Animate: Takes any material (such as wood or stone) and turns it into an
animate level

4 creature. The creature has a mind and will of its own, and acts just
as that type of

creature would act if it were born instead of created.

Blood to Stone: Turns living creatures into stone, or immobilizes them
in their current form. Breaking free is a level 6 Might task.

Enchant: Imbues a normal object with a magical power. The object works
under the

enchanter’s command, and does as the enchanter asks of it. For example,
an enchanter might imbue a foe’s weapon and force it to attack the foe,
or they might imbue a door and have it close tight against incoming
dangers.

Endless Passage: Creates an endless series of thick spiderwebs,
invisible barriers, rings of flame, or other hurdles across an entrance,
exit, tunnel, or passage. Every time one of the hurdles is broken,
another forms. Characters’ movement is halved while going through the
endless passage, and they take 2 points of Intellect damage each round.

Invisible: Turns anything (including themselves, others, and entire
areas up to 30 feet by 30 feet \[9 m by 9 m\]) invisible for ten
minutes. It’s a level 6 Intellect task to be able to see something that
has been made invisible.

Persuasion: Convinces all victims in long range that what they believe
is not real or that what is false is real. Sometimes this ability just
affects others’ minds, creating a mental dissonance. Other times, the
enchanter creates an illusion or other visible, auditory, and tactile
element that persuades a character to believe everything they are

experiencing. The effect lasts for ten minutes. Additionally, an
enchanter may have one or more of the same abilities as a witch or a
faerie.

Interaction: For the characters, an enchanter may be a terrifying foe or
a powerful ally. Enchanters are fickle, perhaps due to their close
relationship with magic, and may change their loyalties on a whim or an
imagined slight.

Use: The characters need to have an object imbued, a person returned to
life, or a curse undone, and they turn to the enchanter for help. The
characters accidentally insulted

the enchanter in some way, and now the enchanter is hunting them down to
get revenge.

Loot: Enchanters often protect their precious items with spells and
magical locks (level 8). Behind those wards are 1d6 cyphers, an
artifact, and an elegant or interesting outfit.

ENCHANTERS OF THE WORLD

Morgan Le Fay 9 (27)

Morgan le Fay (also known as Morgen, Margain, Morgant, and various other
names) is a powerful sorceress from the legends of King Arthur. She has
an unpredictable duality to her nature, with the potential for great
good and great evil.

Combat: Attacks with a variety of weapons, including a sword and staff.
She also can use

any of the following abilities: charm, enchant, glamour, heal,
invisible, persuasion,

protect, revive, seduce, and shrivel.

Interaction: Morgan le Fay is fickle and enigmatic, and rarely reveals
her purposes. If she

agrees to help the characters in some way, it’s absolutely because she
has a higher goal

in mind.

Use: The characters are stopped by a beautiful woman in the woods, who
asks them to

help her accomplish a great task. A powerful foe has brought Morgan le
Fay into his confidence, and she is helping him against the PCs.

Oz, The Great and Terrible 5 (15)

It is perhaps the greatest feat the Wizard of Oz ever pulled off to make
everyone believe that he was not a sorcerer at all, but merely a
ventriloquist and balloonist from some faraway land. He is, in fact, far
more powerful than that, but prefers that no one were ever to know. For
if they did, they would expect things of him, and that makes him
anxious. 

Combat: Oz does not fight, but instead sends his army of green-whiskered
soldiers forth.

He may also use an artifact or spell to protect himself, hide himself,
or flee. He can use

the following abilities: enchant, invisible, persuasion.

Green-whiskered soldiers: level 4; Armor 2; unloaded rifles deal 4
points of damage

Interaction: Curmudgeonly and a bit of a humbug, but rarely with evil
intent, Oz is likely to

help those who ask, although he often fumbles things just to make a
point.

Use: The characters set off to meet the powerful ruler of a strange
land. Or they encounter

someone they believe is just a humble, simple man, but who instead turns
out to be

incredibly powerful.

Loot: Oz has at least one artifact, as well as 1d6 cyphers.

Virgilius the Sorcerer 7 (21)

The most renowned of all the poet-sorcerers, Virgilius studies and uses
the power of the written word to enhance his magical abilities. He keeps
a black book, which is the source of his spells, and creates copper
creatures to protect and defend him. He has a love of challenges, such
as magician’s battles, and seeks them out.

Combat: Can use the following abilities: animate, blood to stone,
enchant, endless passage. Interaction: Virgilius is quick thinking,
wily, and full of interesting schemes. Those who

entertain him for longer than a moment might find him a very useful
ally. However, he is also driven toward revenge, particularly on those
who attempt to publicly humiliate or shame him.

Use: The characters enter into a battle of wits or wills, only to
discover they’re competing with Virgilius.

Loot: Carries a black book

Black book (artifact): level 6; allows the user to cast animate, blood
to stone, enchant, or endless passage. Casting a spell from the black
book costs 2 Intellect points and is an action. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d6

FEY (CREATURES)

In fairy tales, the word fey covers a huge category of creatures, from
faeries, brownies, and imps to gremlins, boggarts, and goblins. There
are so many types of fey beings in

the world that it’s nearly impossible to categorize them as just one
thing, or to list them all. They do have a few characteristics in
common, however. They are typically sentient, humanoid in form,
connected to nature in some way, and magical.

Angiks: Reanimated spirits of babies who died, typically due to hard
winters, and who now haunt the living. At night, they turn into giant
owls and prey on solitary travelers.

Level 3; talons inflict 4 points of damage

Changelings: Fairy children left in place of stolen human babies (and
occasionally adults as well), typically raised among humans.

Level 2; shapeshifting and knowledge of the fey world as level 4

Nymphs: Supernatural beings (often female) associated with protecting a
particular location or landform, such as a river, tree, or mountain.

Level 3, stealth and positive social interactions as level 6

Pixies: Benign and mischievous creatures that live near stone circles,
tombs, and other burial grounds.

Level 2, stealth and finding lost items as level 6

Faerie 3 (9)

In general, faeries (sometimes called fairies or fair folk) are humanoid
in appearance, small in stature, and magical. They are associated with
music, mirth, tricks, and taunts. Seeing one is an omen—hopefully, an
omen of a silly song or the first appearance of an annoying new road
companion (the very faerie sighted) flitting around, asking the
questions of a curious four-year-old hyped up on sugar water and ice
cream. Some faeries are tricksters, delighting in playing pranks and
stealing clothing, equipment, or prized objects. And a few are
malicious, luring travelers to their various dooms, making deadly deals,
and forcing others into captivity.

Not all faeries have wings, but those that do find many ways to use them
to their advantage.

Motive: Unpredictable

Environment: Encountered alone or in a flutter of three to twelve,
usually in forests Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Movement: Immediate; long when flying

Modifications: Tasks related to performance and deception as level 5;
Speed defense as

level 5 due to size and quickness

Combat: A faerie attacks by hurling sparkling magic dust at a target
within short range. In

addition, if a faerie is touched or struck by a melee weapon, more magic
dust puffs away from the faerie and clouds the attacker, who must
succeed on a Speed defense task or suffer the same amount of damage they
just dealt to the faerie. Sometimes faeries wield tiny weapons, such as
bows, spears, or swords; treat these as light weapons.

A faerie can see in the dark, but it can also emit bright light (often
colored) and appear as a glowing humanoid or an illuminated sphere.

Faeries regain 1 point of health per round while their health is above 0
unless they’ve been damaged with a silvered or cold iron weapon.

In addition to inflicting damage with their fairy dust and their weapons
of choice, faeries have a number of curses and abilities at their
disposal. These include the following:

Animal Friend: Most faeries can communicate with animals, and a few can
even summon animals within long range for help and protection. Some
faeries can also grant others the ability to communicate with animals,
but only for a day.

Charm: Some faeries can attempt to use a song or light display to charm
others within short range. The target must succeed on an Intellect
defense task or fall into a suggestible state for one hour. During this
period, the target can be led by the faerie until attacked, damaged, or
shaken from their glamour.

Clairvoyance: The faerie grants someone the ability to see the future,
the past, faeries, or one of the hidden faerie worlds. This gift lasts
for one day, or until the character makes a ten-hour recovery roll.

Heal: The faerie heals themselves, a plant, a creature, or another
character for 1d6 + 2 points of damage.

Illusion: Powerful faeries can cast elaborate and convincing illusions
that make them and their worlds appear more appealing and beautiful.
Illusions can cover up to a mile in area. Seeing through the illusion is
a task equal to the faerie’s level and lasts for ten minutes. After
that, the viewer reverts to seeing the illusion and quickly forgets that
they saw anything else.

Invisibility: Makes the faerie invisible to most eyes. Seeing, hearing,
or sensing a faerie when it’s invisible is a task equal to the faerie’s
level. A failed attempt to see a faerie causes the viewer to see
something that harms their mind, inflicting 1 point of Intellect damage.

Vortex: A defensive tactic where one or more threatened faeries use
their wings to create a strong gust of wind, tornado, or vortex. The
wind pushes their foes back a long distance and inflicts 2 points of
damage.

Faeries have a wide variety of weaknesses, including silver, iron,
technology, sugar and salt (they must count each grain), and cream
(intoxicates them). But not all faeries have the same weaknesses, and
some may not have any.

Interaction: Faeries are mercurial creatures, but except for the
malicious ones, they can be negotiated with, especially if offered
sweets, wine, cream, or other gifts. That said, faerie attention spans
are limited, so even one that means well could end up leaving the PCs in
the lurch at just the wrong moment.

Use: The characters come upon an injured faerie, who promises to grant
them their deepest wish if they agree to help it. They must decide if
they believe the faerie speaks true, or if it’s a trap.

Loot: The tiny pouches that faeries carry are stuffed with forest
bric-a-brac, but some of those pouches are ten times larger on the
inside and could contain expensive items or cyphers.

GM intrusion: A character accidentally does something to offend a
helpful faerie, causing it to turn on them.

Fairy Godmother 6 (18)

Fairy godmothers are nearly always beneficent beings, typically acting
as mentors, parents, or protectors, much like human godparents. The
difference, of course, is that fairy godmothers have a great deal more
magic at their disposal.

Overall, fairy godmothers are kind, gentle, and loving to almost
everyone, not just their godchildren. Of course, not all fairy
godmothers are good at their roles—some may act out of their own
interests and inadvertently (or purposefully) do harm to those they are
supposed to protect. This is particularly true if they feel like they
have not been given the respect they deserve, or have been offended in
some way.

And if you should harm someone they have pledged to protect? Beware,
beware, for there is no wrath like that of a fairy godmother’s.

Motive: Protect their protégés, be respected

Environment: Cities, towns, and anywhere someone is in need of
assistance

Health: 24

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Armor: 2 (magical)

Movement: Short; long when flying

Combat: Fairy godmothers attack by shooting a stream of sharp-edged
glitter up to a long

distance from their magic wands (glitter gets into every nook and
cranny, and thus ignores Armor). Fairy godmothers can bestow blessings
upon their friends and allies, and curse their enemies.

Fairy godmothers can cast any of the skills and abilities that faeries
can cast, as well as a few that are specific to them, including the
following:

A Little Luck: The fairy godmother blesses a character with luck,
granting them the opportunity to reroll once in the next day without
spending XP.

A Little Misfortune: Despite the name, this is usually a beneficial
spell. It is designed to give a nearby character something to overcome
so that they might grow stronger in temperament or stature. When this
spell is cast, the character receives a GM intrusion on their next
action (no matter what their roll is) and receives 1 XP to give away
(but not one to keep).

Alteration: Can turn any creature within short range into a different
creature (such as a mouse into a horse) and any object into a similarly
shaped object (such as a

Prophecy: Creates a prediction for the future of a single person. The
prediction has a high chance of coming true, but is not certain.
(Prophecies work like GM intrusions that will take place in the future;
the player can reject the prophecy by spending an XP.) Not all
prophecies are negative.

Interaction: Interacting with fairy godmothers is usually a little
frantic, frenzied, and full of “Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!” If they like you,
they’re likely to prove a loyal, steadfast, and useful ally. If not,
well, hopefully you like being turned into a horse, or worse.

Use: Fairy godmothers make great lighthearted additions to encounters,
particularly ones where the characters are preparing for a ball, a
fight, or a big adventure.

GM Intrusion: The fairy godmother’s magic goes awry and a character is
accidentally turned into a horse.

Áine, Fairy Queen of Light an Love 9 (27)

Áine is the fairy queen of summer and the sun, and is known by many
names: the Fairy Queen of Light and Love, Bright One, Sun Goddess, and
Sweetheart of the Fairies. She is a kind, true, and benevolent ruler,
and is loved by nearly everyone. Known for making just and fair bargains
with humans, she is often sought after for blessings and boons.

Motive: To be just and true, to protect her realm

Environment: She shares a fairy realm with her sister, Gráinne, where
she rules in the summer months. 

Health: 99

Damage Inflicted: 12 points

Armor: 5

Movement: Short; very long when shapeshifted

Combat: Áine rarely engages in combat herself, as she prefers to leave
that role to her son

Geroid and his army. However, if she’s attacked or feels the need to
defend her realm or someone in it, she will not hesitate to step in. She
attacks using the power of the sun, focusing light into a narrow beam
that inflicts 12 points of damage on the target.

In addition, Áine has the power of chlorokineses—she can manipulate
plants and flowers within very long range, causing them to grow to
enormous proportions. She can use them as weapons that grab and hold
multiple victims (level 7 Might task to break free) or that do damage
via strangulation or thorns (7 points of damage). Any bees in the area
act to help the queen.

Queen’s bees: level 3; sting victims for 3 points of damage and paralyze

them for one round

She can also shapeshift into a red mare as she chooses. As a mare, she
inflicts 6 points of damage with her hooves or bite, can become
immaterial as an action (makes it impossible to successfully attack her,
but she cannot attack in this form), and can move to a spot within long
range instantaneously (does not require an action).

Interaction: Just, true, and kind, Áine makes a powerful ally, provided
that she does not feel that she or her realm are threatened. Those who
wish harm on others or who she sees as malevolent in action or thought
are more likely to

find themselves on the wrong end of the Bright One’s anger.

Use: Characters who wish for something important in their lives to
change may ask Áine to grant them a boon. She sometimes helps those in
need without them asking for it (but, of course, only for a price). If
the characters attend a fairy ball or feast, they may encounter Áine as
an honored guest.

Loot: Áine wears a crown of glass, but it is not visible unless she
chooses it to be (she rarely does) or she dies. She carries little else,
for she is a person of deeds, not items.

GM intrusion: One of Áine’s ardent followers believes a character is
threatening their beloved queen.

Gráinne, the Wayward Daughter 9 (27)

Gráinne is the Fairy Queen of Hope and Despair, sometimes also called
the Wayward Daughter, the Winter Queen, and Dark One. Gráinne is to the
dark what Áine is to the light. This doesn’t mean that Gráinne is evil,
just that she represents what is good and bad in the world that is
hidden in shadows, buried beneath the ground, and revealed at night. She
has her own moral code, one that can work in the favor of those who are
cunning and willing to look at the darkness of their own hearts.

Motive: To honor the darkness, to protect her realm

Environment: She shares a fairy realm with her sister, where she rules
in winter. In the summer, she sleeps in the Sorrows, a belowground realm
out of time and space. 

Health: 99

Damage Inflicted: 12 points

Armor: 5

Movement: Short; long when flying

Combat: Gráinne is a talented combatant, and seems to revel in having a
foe who is a

challenge to her. She carries a dark green crystal staff that emits a
dark coil of reddish energy, which inflicts 12 points of damage.
Alternatively, she can send out a cloud of black smoke that deals 9
points of damage to all creatures in a short area. She also wears the
Tiara of Pailis, a griffin-shaped tiara that allows her to fly. Gráinne
has a variety of magical abilities at her disposal, including the
following:

Animal Communication: Gráinne has a special affinity with badgers and
can ask them for help. When she calls them (as an action), a cete of
eight large badgers appears. They act as two level 4 creatures; attacked
beings must also succeed on an Intellect defense roll or be shapeshifted
into a badger for one round.

Oneirokinesis: Gráinne can infiltrate people’s dreams to converse with
them. As such, she might implant an idea in their heads (such as “I’m
going to die tonight” or “I should go back home”). When the character
wakes, they must succeed on a level 6 Intellect defense roll to shake
the idea. Otherwise, they feel a strong need to act on it, and are
hindered in any tasks that go against the idea (this lasts until they
make their next recovery roll).

Shadowmelding: Gráinne merges with shadows, making her nearly

intangible. In this form, she cannot be injured by physical attacks, and
her attacks inflict 8 points of Intellect damage on anyone whose body is
darkened by her shadow.

Interaction: For those who don’t mind a little darkness and moral
ambiguity, Gráinne makes a powerful ally.

Use: The characters stumble into a fairy realm, only to be met by its
just-woken guardian. Grieving characters may find the solutions and
solace they seek in Gráinne’s magic and power.

Loot: Tiara of Pailis

Tiara of Pailis (artifact): level 7; allows the wearer to fly a long
distance each round (as an action). The wearer can control their speed,
direction, and height. Depletion: 1 in 1d20

GM Intrusion: A character’s companion animal or mount is affected by
Gráinne’s animal affinity and falls under her power.

Queen 6 (18)

Ah, the Evil Queen. Ruler of the land, watcher in the mirror. Full of
magic, utterly merciless, and sharp of tongue. Evil and wicked queens
abound in fairy tales, from those who have no names and are remembered
only for their evil deeds, to those whose names will never be forgotten:
Queen Grimhilde, Maleficent, the Queen of Hearts, and the White Witch.
These queens seek power for power’s sake, not caring what destruction
lies in their wake.

Of course, not all queens are evil—just the ones you hear about most
often. But they are all powerful in their own way, even if they are
forced to hide it by their circumstances. While they too crave power,
they seek it in order to protect their lands, their people, and their
loved ones.

Motive: Power

Environment: Anywhere, but typically in cities and towns, where there
are people to admire

and fear them 

Health: 18

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Movement: Short

Combat: Queens almost always carry an artifact of great power, such as a
staff, crown,

mirror, or sword, that grants them unique abilities and skills.

Queens often have familiars, such as ravens, who fight for or beside
them. Most familiars can do 4 points of damage with an attack.

Some queens may also be witches or fey creatures, and thus have the
ability to use one or two spells and curses that witches and fey also
use.

Queen Grimhilde 8 (24)

Perhaps best known for her attempts to kill Snow White through magic and
poison, Grimhilde has other passions and talents as well. She seeks ways
to make all beings obey her commands, starting with the huntsman who so
stupidly and willfully deceived her so long ago.

Environment: One of her many castles, the woods

Armor: 2

Health: 18

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Movement: Short

Combat: Her vulture familiars swirl about all foes in short range,
knocking them prone

and inflicting 4 points of damage. She can use the following witch
abilities: glamour,

imprison, and seduce.

Vulture familiars: level 4

Interaction: Grimhilde is cunning and devious, always hatching plans
against those who

harm her, who threaten to overshadow her, or who have caught her eye in
some way. 

Use: The characters enter an area that is under Grimhilde’s power and
must face her wrath. 

Loot: She has a mirror mirror artifact, as well as 1d6 cyphers (often
poison).

The Red Queen 6 (18)

The Red Queen has never once yelled “Off with her head!” In fact, she
has never yelled. It’s horrible manners, and besides, when you know how
to wield power, you don’t need all that noise and chaos. You need only
whisper and be still, and everyone will politely fall quiet and listen.

Environment: Polite dinner parties and social gatherings

Armor: 1

Combat: Prefers verbal sparring over the physical sort, and inflicts 3
points of damage with a single cutting remark or sharp-tongued retort.

Interaction: The Red Queen is quite proper and chatty, the perfect host
and the perfect guest. The only time she ever grows irate is when the
subject of her sister, the Queen of Hearts, comes up.

Use: While attending a party to steal something, the characters are
caught by the Red Queen

The Snow Queen

The Snow Queen rules over the “snow bees”—snowflakes that look like
bees. She keeps an ornate palace surrounded by gardens in the lands of
permafrost, but she can be seen elsewhere in the world where snowflakes
cluster. Most say she is cold, and they would be right. She has been
part of the snow for so long that it’s possible she no longer remembers
warmth or kindness or love.

Environment: Anywhere there is snow, ice, or winter

Armor: 2 (from personal ice walls)

Combat: Creates a snowstorm that blinds all foes in long range for three
rounds; ice shards rain down upon all foes in long range, inflicting 2
points of damage; reindeer familiar inflicts 5 points of damage with her
horns.

Interaction: The Snow Queen is not evil—she just has forgotten what it
means to be human, with human needs and human hearts (not that she was
ever truly human, but that’s a story for another time). She is willing
to bargain if she understands what she gets out of it.

Use: The Snow Queen guards the entrance to a place the characters need
to enter.

OF WATER AND WAVES (CREATURES)

Creatures of water and waves are those that inhabit or are deeply tied
to the rivers, ocean, marshes, and other watery areas of the world.

Drowning Fairies: There are many types of creatures known as “drowning
fairies,” including Peg Powler, the Water Leaper, Fossegrim, and Jenny
Greenteeth. These creatures typically dwell below or next to water and
tempt, pull, or trick passersby into the water.

Level 6, persuasion and creating illusions as level 7; can grab a
creature in short range and pull them into and under the water and
attempt to drown them (level 6 Might or Speed defense task to break
free)

Fuath: Fuathan are intangible spirits that dwell deep in the seas and
oceans. They consider themselves protectors of these realms,
particularly against fishermen and others who would damage the
environment or creatures there. Fuathan have the power to make
themselves visible, most often taking the form of humanoid creatures
with green skin and the flowing mane and tail of a golden horse.

Level 5, defense as level 7 due to intangibility; if they know a
person’s name, they can gain control over the person, forcing them to do
their bidding for a short time

Naiad: These water nymphs inhabit rivers, springs, waterfalls, and other
bodies of fresh water. Typically appearing as beautiful young women with
long limbs and flowing hair, naiads are considered protectors, for they
guard their land fiercely. However, they are easily provoked and their
wrath is fierce.

Level 4; can cause water to boil, inflicting 3 points of heat damage on
foes; can unleash flash floods that sweep all foes back a very long
distance and inflict 2 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor)

Cailleach 5 (15)

Not actually a water spirit, but one who has made her peace with the sea
in an eternal bargain, Cailleach once lived on land. Now she is a
recluse deep in the ocean in the realm known as the Expanse of Halirane.
She appears ancient, and in fact is much older than that. She shaves her
head bald, wears dozens of shell earrings in each ear, and has a glass
eye that allows her to see three views of the future. As part of her
bargain with the sea, she can never return to dry land again, or she
will lose all of her powers forever.

Motive: To be left alone

Environment: A home hidden inside a coral reef at the bottom of the
ocean. Her home is a large dead whale that the sea magically preserves
as part of their bargain. 

Health: 30

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Movement: Short; very long when shapeshifted

Modifications: Seeing through deceptions and lies as level 6, healing as
level 8

Combat: Cailleach has many abilities at her disposal, some of which come
from the sea and

others that come from her own magic. They include the following:

Healing Pot: If she has the proper ingredients and takes a day to do so,
Cailleach can brew a healing salve in her special pot. Depending on what
she adds to the mixture, this salve can do one of three things: restore
10 Might points, move someone up one step on the damage track, or remove
a curse (up to level 6).

Reptilian Form: Cailleach takes the form of a reptile of any size. While
in this form, she has +3 Armor and does 6 points of damage with her
bite, claw, or tail lash. In addition, she regains 3 points of health
per round.

Restore to Life: Putting her wizened pointer finger into someone’s mouth
can bring them back to life, but only if they’ve been dead for less than
a day and only if she holds her finger there for exactly as long as
they’ve been dead. After that, her finger falls off. It takes three days
for her to regrow a new one.

See the Future: Cailleach can use her glass eye to scry the future of an
individual. She does so by first removing the eye, and then having the
person hold it in their mouth until she asks for it back (sometimes this
is for just a second, and sometimes it’s for hours—it’s hard to know if
the variable length of time is part of the ritual or just her dark sense
of humor). She typically sees three possible futures, and all of them
have an equal chance of coming to pass.

Wanton Destruction: As part of her agreement with the sea, Cailleach was
given the power to control small parts of it at a time. She can create a
whirlpool that catches up all creatures and objects within short range
of its center and inflicts 5 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor).

Interaction: Cailleach is a recluse and introvert whose deepest longing
is to be left alone

to increase her knowledge of magic. She also likes puzzles and games,
and out of everything on land, she misses birds most of all (for
interacting with, not eating). Those who bring her any of those items
are likely to draw Cailleach out of her shell and have a positive
interaction.

Use: Cailleach can be a beneficial ally, particularly as a healer. She
might also be convinced to help fight against an encroaching danger,
especially if it’s threatening her solitude and privacy.

Loot: She typically carries a number of sea cyphers, and her home is
filled with books, scrolls, and journals of all sorts.

GM intrusion: The sea offers additional assistance to Cailleach’s
spells, increasing her damage or movement.

Kelpie 6 (18)

A sinister aquatic creature that takes the shape of a grey horse or
white pony, the kelpie lures unsuspecting passersby and attempts to
drown them in a nearby body of water.

Some kelpies look just like horses. Others look as if they’re created
from elements of the swamp—maybe its tail is algae, its mane cattails,
its eyes glowing pebbles or miniature moons. Maybe eels and snails and
other creatures are its teeth or tongue. One thing about kelpies is
always true: their manes are always dripping and their hooves are always
inverted.

If someone knows a kelpie’s name and says it aloud, the kelpie loses all
its power over that person and retreats to the depths of the water.

Motive: Unknown

Environment: Near or in rivers, streams, lakes, and other bodies of
running or still water.

Modern settings might find them near public or private swimming pools,
koi ponds,

and reservoirs. 

Health: 21

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Movement: Very long when running

Combat: When a passerby approaches, the kelpie might appear tame, a
little lost, injured,

or otherwise friendly and in need. Or, if the passerby appears weary or
sad, the kelpie will offer a ride upon their back. The kelpie’s sticky
skin traps the rider (level 7 Might task to break free). Once the rider
is seated, the kelpie may attempt to drown them in the lake, run so fast
that the rider takes 5 points of Intellect damage from fright, or roll
over on them, inflicting 4 points of damage (ignores Armor).

Interaction: Not all kelpies are malevolent. Some were once “tamed” by
someone who learned their names and loved them. These kelpies actively
seek out human contact, attempting to find someone to replace the one
they loved.

Use: In the gloom, a large black horse appears, wearing beautiful tack
and acting as if lost. It offers one of the weary characters a ride upon
its back.

GM intrusion: While dealing with something else, the characters come
upon a kelpie in the process of drowning someone.

The West Wind 9 (27)

The West Wind has no master, no shackles, no chains. She goes where she
will, and woe to those who try to capture or hold her. When she’s not
blowing through the sky, she takes the shape of a human woman dressed in
a sparkling blue tuxedo, her short silver hair pushed back from her
face.

Not all winds are living creatures. Sometimes the wind is just the wind.
But you won’t know which is which until you try to talk with it.

Motive: To stave off boredom by playing tricks, traveling, stirring up
trouble, and helping others

Environment: Anywhere she wants to be 

Health: 40

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Movement: Very long

Modifications: Speed defense as level 10; sees through and resists
trickery, lies, deceit, and intimidation as level 10

Combat: Inflicts 6 points of damage to every creature and object she
chooses within a very long distance, and knocks them prone.

Interaction: Some say the West Wind is cold, but she’s really just an
introvert and prefers to spend most of her time traveling alone.
However, she’s actually very warm hearted and is likely to help those in
need. She does not respond well to trickery, traps, or attempts to force
her hand (unless they’re terribly clever or smart, and then she admits
grudging respect for the perpetrators).

Use: The characters need the West Wind’s help to travel somewhere, knock
something down, or retrieve something from a hidden place. Someone needs
an elegant date to a royal ball or a fairy festival.

Loot: Sometimes the West Wind picks up interesting things on her
travels. She may gift allies these items, including cyphers, artifacts,
and even creatures.

GM intrusion: The West Wind lifts a character high in the air and
threatens to let them fall.

Wind Children 4 (12)

The children of the wind cannot be measured in known numbers, for they
are here and there and everywhere. They are not born, so much as borne,
by weather patterns, wishes, and wants. Dust devils, gales, and zephyrs
are all wind children.

Motive: See everything, know everything

Environment: Everywhere there is weather, real or magic-made 

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Movement: Long

Combat: Inflicts 4 points of damage with an exhale. Alternatively, can
knock a character prone for one round.

Interaction: Interacting with wind children is a bit like interacting
with a group of mischievous, precocious, and spoiled kids. However, they
know many things, having been all over the world, and will often share
what they know in exchange for new secrets or knowledge.

Use: One of the PCs seeks information about a person, place, or thing.
The characters need a surreptitious spy to gather information for them.

Loot: Information, secrets, and possibly a cypher or two picked up
during their travels.

GM intrusion: The wind children grab something precious from one of the
characters and start to play a game of “keep away” with it.

Witch 5 (15)

Witches are complex beings of myriad personalities, desires, and
abilities. Sometimes they’re the stuff of nightmares, with tales of
their exploits keeping children safe in their beds during the darkest
hours. Other times they’re wise helpers—at least for a little

while, or possibly for a price. Often, they’re a little of everything,
taking on no end of roles throughout their lifetime. They may isolate
themselves deep in the dark woods, falsify their way into a royal
family, or reside in the middle of town, hiding their identity.

But one thing they are, always, is dangerous, for they carry within
their hearts and heads knowledge, power, and magic—and a willingness to
use all of them when necessary. Motive: Domination of others, power,
knowledge, eternal life or beauty, hunger, revenge Environment: Almost
anywhere, although most often alone in unique dwellings in the

forest, in civilization as healers, or having infiltrated royal
families 

Health: 21

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Movement: Short; long if flying

Combat: In addition to inflicting damage with their weapon of choice
(often a staff or long,

curved blade), witches can curse their enemies.

They also have a number of spells and abilities at their disposal. These
include the

Following:

Familiar: When attacked, a witch relies on the aid of their familiar to
improve their Speed

defense. The familiar could be a large black cat, an owl, a big snake,
or some other creature. Killing a witch’s familiar is so shocking to a
witch that their attacks and Speed defense are hindered for a few days.
It’s also a way to ensure that the witch never forgives their foe or
grants mercy.

Glamour: Glamour is an illusion that the witch creates. It may let them
look like someone else, appear to be a tree or a bird, or even make them
invisible. Seeing through the glamour is a level 8 Intellect task. A
failed attempt inflicts 2 points of Intellect damage. Once a character
sees through the glamour, they cannot unsee it.

Heal: The witch touches another creature and heals them for 6 points of
damage. Some witches must pull health from another living being in long
range in order to use this ability. Pulling health from a living being
inflicts 2 points of damage on that being.

Imprison: The witch creates a prison within long range and captures a
foe inside it as a single action. The prison might be physical (a tower,
a cage, a trap, a binding around the body) or mental (they can’t move,
their muscles are no longer under their control, they are afraid to
move). Resisting being caught is a level 5 defense task (Might, Speed,
or Intellect, depending on the type of imprisonment). If a character is
caught, breaking free is a level 5 task (of the appropriate stat).

Protect: Places a confinement spell to keep someone from going in or out
of a location, building, or room. Those who attempt to pass through the
spell but fail take 3 points of Intellect damage and are knocked back.
Once the spell activates, it disappears.

Revive: This rare and costly ability allows a witch to bring someone
back to life, as long as they haven’t been dead for more than a year. In
order to accomplish this, the witch needs all or part of the body of the
dead, a beloved object of the dead’s, and the willingness of someone
else to take on a curse that results from the magical working (roll on
the Curse table to determine the resulting curse). Revive takes ten
minutes to cast, and the character returns to life with 1 point in all
of their Pools.

Seduce: Creatures within short range who fail an Intellect defense roll
become enamored of the witch. Resisting the witch’s persuasion attempts
is hindered by two steps until the victim succeeds on an Intellect
defense roll; each time they fail to resist the persuasion attempt, the
witch’s next persuasion attempt is eased by an additional step.

Additional abilities: Witches might also have access to the witch
abilities in the Cypher System Rulebook. These are charm, hexbolt,
shrivel, and vitality. Some witches might have other magical abilities
similar to those of enchanters.

GM intrusions: The witch’s familiar joins the fray, tripping up
characters and hindering their actions.

Something startles the witch and they cast a curse or spell as an
automatic response. The witch pulls out an artifact or cypher and
prepares to use it.

WITCHES OF THE WORLD

Baba Yaga 9 (27)

Baba Yaga (sometimes called Frau Trude) lives many lives and has many
personalities. She is both one witch and many. She uses her magic to
create a new version of herself each time her

life takes a new branch, following all of them at once, becoming every
version of herself that she might have been.

Some versions of Baba Yaga are helpful. Others harmful. Some Baba Yagas
live

in the woods in a wooden hut that walks around on giant chicken legs,
some

fly through the sky in a giant mortar and pestle, and some guard any
wild spaces that they have deemed important. Some capture and cook young
children in a special stove. Some do all of the above.

Combat: Baba Yaga can use the following abilities: heal, hexbolt,
imprison, protect, revive, shrivel, and vitality.

Interaction: It is almost impossible to know which Baba Yaga you have
met until you look deep in her eyes (a level 7 Intellect task). There,
you might see a tiny flame, and in that flame, learn a bit about her
life.

Use: Baba Yaga has her long, bony fingers in nearly everything that
happens. She might be behind the counter at the herb and potion shop,
guarding the entrance to a cave full of treasure, or offering her
services in breaking (or casting) curses.

Loot: 1d6 cyphers, an artifact, and various other odds and ends

The Blind Witch 5 (15)

The Blind Witch is skinny and always hungry. She lives deep in the
forest in a house made of confectionery, which allows her to catch,
fatten, and eventually eat any children unlucky enough to get caught in
her trap.

Modifications: Cooking as level 6, deception and trickery as level 7,
seeing through

deception and trickery as level 4

Combat: She can use the following abilities: charm, protect, and
vitality. She is immune to visual effects, including hallucinations.

Interaction: The Blind Witch can appear sweet and charming, and might
play up her blindness and apparent frailty for sympathy.

Use: Characters wandering the woods might come upon a candy house, and
woe to them

should they take a bite. A rescue mission could lead here.

Loot: She usually has at least one magical animal in a cage, along with
various children and

even adults. Two or three cyphers can be found in her kitchen, along
with her magic oven, which bakes children into gingerbread.

Dame Gothel 5 (15)

Sometimes taking the form of a young woman and sometimes an old one,
Dame Gothel cares for one thing above all: her beautiful walled garden,
the flowers and vegetables that grow inside it being the envy of all
others. Unlike many other witches, she does not harm children and in
fact has been known to protect them, at least as long as they are
innocent of wrongdoing.

Modifications: Gardening and potions as level 6

Combat: She can use the following abilities: heal, imprison, protect,
and shrivel. 

Interaction: Dame Gothel is an introvert who mostly desires to be left
alone, and woe be

to those who invade her space in any way, for she has a deep sense of
right and wrong and a penchant for revenge upon those who cross her.
However, she has been known to help those seeking aid, and is
particularly skilled in using what she grows in her garden to aid her
magic.

Use: The characters need a concoction to heal someone, remove a curse,
or help them get pregnant. The characters accidentally trespass on Dame
Gothel’s space.

Loot: Various plants, potions, and cyphers

The Sea Witch 6 (18)

Living in the darkest depths of the sea, the Sea Witch is dangerous,
wily, persuasive, and scheming. She is best known for brewing up life
options—for a price. If you want what she’s got (and she’s got
everything), you bring her what she wants. It might be your voice, your
hair, or your firstborn. Or all three. Surely you won’t miss them . . .

Modifications: Persuasion, intimidation, coercion, and swimming as level
8

Combat: She can use the following abilities: charm, familiar (water
snakes), glamour, imprison, protect, seduce, and shrivel.

Interaction: The Sea Witch will always make a bargain, take a bet,
gamble all she’s got on

the downtrodden and woe-be-gotten. Not because her heart is big, but
because she makes sure that the house—that’s her—always wins.

Use: The characters need a potion, a spell, a curse, or any other bit of
magic, large or

small, and the Sea Witch will find a way to put it in their hands and
let them walk away

thinking they’ve come out ahead. At least until she comes to collect.

Loot: A chest full of gifts and winnings from lovers, fawners, and those
who should have known better, including 1d6 cyphers and two artifacts.

The Wicked Witch of the West 5 (15)

With her three pigtails and diminutive stature, it would be easy to
write off the Wicked Witch of the West as a nobody—and many have—but her
power lies in the creatures that work for her and in her vast and
growing collection of magical footwear.

She can see up to 2 miles (3 km) away with her single eye, and wears
galoshes that give her +2 Armor against water and liquid of all kinds.

Modifications: Tasks involving water and the dark as level 3

Combat: She carries an umbrella that acts as a heavy weapon, and she can
use the following abilities: familiar (pack of wolves, swarm of bees,
flock of crows, and an army

of flying monkeys), hexbolt, imprison, protect, and shrivel.

Interaction: She is volatile in nature and quick to anger. However, she
can also be a bit cowardly, and will likely back down in a confrontation
(only to send her hordes of magical animals out afterward to do her
dirty work).

Use: The characters need to find galoshes of fortune and decide to steal
a pair from the

Wicked Witch of the West. Perhaps they need to make it through the land
she presides over and must find a way to get her approval.

Loot: Whatever shoes she’s wearing (which are very likely an artifact).

NPCs

The NPCs in the following section are general examples of nonmagical,
mortal human characters that are commonly found in fairy tales.

From General to Specific: While the NPCs listed here are general types,
such as crafter and robber, it’s easy to turn them into specific
characters from common and well-known fairy tales. For example, with a
little tweaking, you can turn a generic tailor into the tailor from The
Brave Little Tailor. Just give the crafter NPC a banner that says “SEVEN
WITH ONE BLOW” and embrace a jaunty, overconfident nature, and you have
the titular character.

Health, Not Pools: Remember that NPCs don’t have stat Pools. Instead,
they have a characteristic called health. When an NPC takes damage of
any kind, the amount

is subtracted from their health. Unless described otherwise, an NPC’s
health

is always equal to their target number. Some NPCs might have special
reactions to or defenses against attacks that would normally deal Speed
damage or Intellect damage, but unless the NPC’s description
specifically explains this, assume that all damage is subtracted from
the NPC’s health.

Naming Your NPCs: You might have noticed that in fairy tales, many
characters —especially those of the lower or working classes—don’t have
a name beyond their title, position, or profession (or sometimes their
marriage status). “The Woodcutter,” “the Tailor,” “the Baker’s wife,”
and so on. While you could follow suit and just call your NPC “the
Woodcutter,” most player characters are going to ask that person their
name. It’s likely to break immersion if you throw in a modern name, or
if the NPC tries to explain that they don’t have one, they’re just
called “the Woodcutter.” And if you call them all Jack, then no one
(including you) will remember which one is which. Consider coming up
with a list of names ahead of time so that you’re always ready to give
players something to call a new walk-on character. 

Aristocrat 4 (12)

Aristocrats are not quite high royalty—they are not kings or queens, nor
even princes and princesses—but they are those with money and power
enough to wield in dangerous or glorious ways. Knights and barons are
typically aristocrats, as are characters like Bluebeard and Mr. Fox.
Some aristocrats, such as knights, may only want to do good and protect
the things that matter to them. Others, of course, prefer to use the
darker side of their privileged position.

Motive: Money, power, marriage, take who or what they want, protect what
they care about Environment: Typically in cities and towns, occasionally
off by themselves in large castles and manors 

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Armor: 2

Movement: Short

Modifications: Social engineering, persuasion, intimidation, and lying
as level 6

Combat: Many aristocrats have had training in combat maneuvers, as is
appropriate to their station. Others may wield knives, scalpels, or
butcher’s tools with precision.

Interaction: Interaction with an aristocrat often starts out
positive—after all, it is delightful to be in the glow of someone so
charming and powerful. For some, the interaction remains positive. A
knight is just a knight. For others, a sense of unease begins to settle
in after a time, as if there’s something not quite right behind the
facade.

Use: An aristocrat is about to marry and someone is worried about the
safety of their future spouse. A knight is outmatched by a dragon or
other strong opponent and seeks someone to come to their aid.

Loot: Most aristocrats have currency equal to a very expensive item, in
addition to fine clothes or medium armor, weapons, and miscellaneous
items.

GM intrusions: The aristocrat’s house has a sentient door or lock that
suddenly begins to yell about intruders.

Child 1 (3)

Children play the roles of urchins, siblings, daughters, sons, waifs,
servants, royal family members, child brides, and more.

Motive: Seeking safety, comfort, money, or food; play; bringing joy

Environment: With their families, or lost in the world trying to find
their way. Sometimes in

the employ or care of someone who has found them, stolen them, or
otherwise become

their guardians, caretakers, or keepers. 

Health: 3

Damage Inflicted: 1 point

Movement: Short

Modifications: Run, hide, sneak, and escape as level 2; knowledge of the
nearby area, people, and activities as level 3

Combat: Most children fight only in response to being provoked,
threatened, or attacked. They typically use makeshift weapons, such as
their fists, a stick, or a toy. 

Interaction: Children are often smarter, more creative, and more wily
than they’re given credit for. They may have a lot of knowledge about
nearby people, places, and activities that can help the PCs,
particularly if there’s an exchange of food, money, or other goodies
involved.

Use: Someone or something is stealing children from the village, and the
mayor is offering to pay a large sum to anyone who tracks down the
creature and rescues the children. One of the PCs catches a waif
stealing from their pack in the night; the child says they’ve been lost
in the woods for days.

Loot: Children typically have very little on their person, although they
may have a special memento of their family or a close friend.

GM intrusions: The child shouts, laughs, or talks too loudly,
accidentally drawing the attention of a nearby guard toward a character.

Someone mistakenly thinks a character has stolen the child, and attacks
them.

Crafter 2 (6)

Crafters include bakers, cobblers, candlemakers, butchers, millers,
tailors, woodworkers, and cooks. While most crafters aren’t particularly
agile fighters, they are usually clever and strong, and have a number of
familiar tools at their disposal for weapons.

Motive: Defense

Environment: In their workshops or peddling their trade while traveling 

Health: 8

Damage Inflicted: 3 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Appropriate craft as level 3

Combat: Crafters are unlikely to initiate combat, as most just want to
be left alone to do

their work (or to convince you to buy their wares). If they’re forced to
fight, they will typically use any item they have at hand (such as a
rolling pin, butcher’s knife, crafting tool, or length of wood).

Interaction: Most crafters are happy to talk about their craft or the
objects that they’ve made and have for sale. They take pride in their
work, and flattery and attention can go a long way.

Use: To the PCs, crafters can be allies, obstacles, or both. Being
friends with a crafter often has obvious long-term benefits, while
stealing from them has short-term advantages (and possible long-term
disadvantages).

Loot: A crafter has currency equivalent to an inexpensive item, as well
as crafting tools and materials and anything they’ve crafted that
they’re carrying or wearing.

GM intrusion: The crafter uses their crafting tool in a way that the
character didn’t anticipate, putting the character in a disadvantaged
position.

Huntsman/Woodcutter 2 (6)

A huntsman may be in the employ of a powerful magic user, protecting a
section of the woods they consider their own, or just trying to provide
for their family by chopping wood and hunting game.

Motive: Follow orders, support their loved ones, protect the innocent

Environment: Woods, forests, and other wild lands 

Health: 8

Damage Inflicted: 2 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short

Modifications: Tracking and pathfinding as level 4

Combat: Huntsmen and woodcutters both understand the power of the
perfectly aimed

shot or swing. They take their time, steady their hand and breath, and
hit with precision

and force.

When they take no action on a turn, their next attack inflicts twice the
normal damage. Interaction: Many huntsmen and woodcutters are motivated
by a deep need to be loyal,

but they’re also soft of heart and have a strong moral center. If
they’re tasked with

something they deem unpalatable, they may forgo their promises and go
rogue.

Use: They are hunting the characters on the orders of a higher
authority. They save the PCs

from a dangerous foe, then ask for assistance for their own tasks.

Loot: In addition to their clothing and mundane weapon, they likely have
an expensive

token of promise or affection from someone they have helped or who they
owe fealty to.

GM intrusion: A perfectly timed cut sends a tree down in the direction
of the character.

Robber/Thief 4 (12)

Robbers, thieves, highwaymen, robin hoods—whatever name you call them,
they want what you have, and they’re willing to get it any way they can.
Some robbers are honorable, stealing only from the rich or the evil.
Others will take anything that isn’t nailed down or magically protected.

Robbers often travel in pairs or small groups of dedicated friends and
fellow robbers. Motive: What’s yours is mine

Environment: Anywhere there’s something to be stolen

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 2 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short

Modifications: Stealth, including sneaking, stealing, hiding, and
deception, as level 5; attacking from hiding as level 5

Combat: Robbers typically prefer light and medium weapons, particularly
bows and small blades. Interaction: Most robbers have a moral code of
some sort—it just may not be the code

that others abide by. Still, they are willing to listen to reason (and
particularly the sound of sliding coins). Robbers are often willing to
be hired for jobs that are too difficult for others.

Use: Robbers happen upon the place where the characters have made camp,
and ask to join them. A group of robbers arrives to steal a thing that
the characters are just about to steal themselves.

Loot: Depending on whether they’ve just robbed someone or not, robbers
may have anywhere from nothing (other than their weapons and clothing)
up to the currency equivalent of a very expensive item.

GM intrusion: The robber’s arrow manages to hit two foes in a single
attack, or the robber shoots two arrows at multiple foes.

Scholar 2 (6)

Scholars might be librarians, sages, wise women, crones, experts, or
soothsayers. Typically, scholars seek knowledge above all else, and many
also are willing to share it with others (sometimes for a price,
sometimes just for the joy of sharing knowledge). A scholar’s expertise
might be general or specific—they may study the world at large or home
in on a specific type of magic or fey being, for example.

Motive: Find answers, seek knowledge

Environment: Schools, libraries, the royal study, laboratories, and
anywhere there are sources of information 

Health: 6

Damage Inflicted: 3 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Intuition, persuasion, detecting falsehoods, and most
knowledge tasks as level 4

Combat: Scholars prefer to avoid a fight. If they must fight, a scholar
tries to deduce a foe’s

weaknesses (if any) and exploit them in combat. Some scholars might have
learned spells or abilities from those they’ve studied. Others might be
examining a useful cypher or artifact, and will use it on their
attackers.

Interaction: Most scholars are helpful and full of information (whether
or not it’s useful or true information varies from scholar to scholar).
What they don’t know, they may be willing to learn or study, if given
the proper tools and incentive. However, some scholars are secretive,
hoarding their knowledge for their own personal uses.

Use: Scholars can be incredible allies, offering clues, hints, and
information that can help the characters. However, they may be reclusive
and hard to find, hidden away in ancient libraries or secret
laboratories.

Loot: Most scholars have currency equivalent to a very expensive item
and one or two cyphers.

GM Intrusion: Something the scholar is studying comes alive, creating
havoc and disarray throughout the area.

HORROR RULES MODULE

Although it’s very likely a subset of the modern genre, horror as a
genre gets special treatment. Unlike the other genres, horror doesn’t
necessarily suggest a setting. Any setting can be horrific. Horror is
more of a style. An approach. A mood.

You could easily have horror in other times and settings, but for our
purposes, we’ll deal with a default setting in the modern day. The PCs
are probably normal people, not secret agents or special investigators
(although being a part of a secret agency that deals with monsters in
the shadows could make for a fine horror game).

Suggested types and additional equipment for a horror setting are the
same as in a modern setting.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF HORROR MECHANICS

This chapter describes many different optional rules (called “horror
modules”) for making horror games more exciting or suspenseful. Horror
modules are tweaks the GM applies

to the rules to make a horror scenario even more scary or to represent
how

an event usually happens in a horror genre

If a module changes the options that players or PCs have, the GM should
tell the players about it when the game begins. For example, if the GM
is using the Character Posse module, the players should know about it at
the start of the game so they can become familiar with all their
characters instead of having to pause when they switch scenes and spend
several minutes reviewing a second set of characters. Likewise, players
should know if their healing options are affected by the Ironman module,
or if they have additional recovery roll options from the Hysteria
module.

This chapter also suggests various modules that are appropriate for
different horror genres. The GM should feel free to use some, all, or
none of those modules when running a game of that type, or introduce
other modules to provide a unique twist to the game.

 GENERAL HORROR GM INTRUSIONS

The following GM intrusions work for most horror genres.

• Something foils a character’s attempt to escape: a getaway car won’t
start, they drop the keys that unlock the exit door or lock up the
villain, or the shotgun they’re using to clear a path jams or runs out
of shells.

• The antagonist enters a secure or sealed room by an unexpected method:
crashing through a door or wall, crawling out of a ventilation shaft,
jumping out of a trap door, manifesting electronically through a Wi-Fi
signal, or teleporting.

• A mysterious noise nearby amplifies the tension, and when investigated
reveals itself to

be . . . a cat, either perfectly calm or hissing and leaping. This often
allows for a momentary de-escalation followed by a real scare, such as
the antagonist reaching out of the darkness to grab a character.

• A dramatic and/or ridiculous amount of blood and gore from something
that just got killed splashes on a character, blinding them until they
take an action to wipe their eyes clean.

BAD PENNY

An unwanted or dangerous object (such as a cursed artifact) keeps
turning up, no matter how many times the PCs try to discard or destroy
it. In many cases, there might be only one way to rid themselves of the
item (such as dousing it with holy water or burying it in a graveyard)
or only one way to destroy it (such as burning it in a church or
stabbing it with a magical dagger). The item might slowly repair
itself—and depending on the item, it might be more frightening if it
shows up fully intact or still bearing damage from how the PCs tried to
destroy it.

This reappearance usually isn’t because the item is literally walking to
wherever the PCs are (although if the item is something like a cursed
doll, that might make it more frightening). In most cases, it just
happens to be where the PCs went, found in an unobtrusive place like the
back of a closet, under a car seat, or in the bottom of someone’s
luggage. If the item is intelligent (or controlled by a hostile
intelligence), it might use NPCs to bring it back to the PCs, and might
sacrifice those NPCs in dramatic and gory ways to make sure it ends up
back in the hands of the PCs. For example, if the PCs abandon a haunted
ring, on the next day when they’re waiting for a train they recognize a
man they saw earlier just as he gets hit by an oncoming train, and his
severed hand—wearing the ring—lands at their feet. Even if the PCs go to
a remote area with no people, one of them might suddenly vomit up their
lunch—and the haunted ring.

CHARACTER POSSE

Every player is given at least two characters to run, each with about
the same amount of background and abilities so they’re all suitable as
main characters. A player usually runs only one of these PCs at a time.
As the action in the story changes locations, the GM can have one or
more players switch their active PC and interact with the other active
PCs and the story in

a different way. This keeps the players from knowing which characters
are supposed to have the important roles in the story, allows for some
of the PCs to split off for a while without the rest

of the group having to wait, and gives every player a backup character
to play if their active PC dies.

Character Posse works best when the characters are very simple and don’t
have many abilities that require a lot of knowledge and description.
That way the player can focus on the personality of the PC and not have
to keep remembering a stack of complicated abilities. In a non-fantastic
modern setting, that often means characters who have a lot of skills and
automatic or simple bonuses (like Combat Prowess and Fleet of Foot) but
one or zero abilities that have durations or require special actions
(like Anecdote and Muscles of Iron).

DEAD ALL ALONG  
A handful of people are forced to stick together under unusual
circumstances—they’re survivors of a shipwreck, quarantined to avoid an
outbreak of a deadly disease, waiting for a riot to leave their
neighborhood, or locked away from an approaching zombie horde. They hear
strange noises, glimpse shadowy figures, and find that things move about
or disappear when nobody is looking. The PCs begin to suspect they’re
being haunted by ghosts or observed by mysterious aliens; one or more of
them disappear or are found dead. Eventually the PCs realize that they
are ghosts of people who haven’t come to terms with their own deaths,
and the weird experiences are their limited interactions with the real
world and the living people trying to bury their bodies or put their
souls at peace.

In these stories, the emotional journey of the ghosts is about
understanding their situation and coming to terms with their deaths. In
normal play, GM intrusions are complications that the characters have to
deal with, but to represent the secret and inverted expectation of this
module, GM intrusions are used to simplify what the characters
experience, but with a spooky twist.

When a PC crosses over and disappears, that player can still participate
in the game by using the Ghostly Helpers module.

FRAGILITY 

Whenever a character selects the Increasing Capabilities option for
advancement or gains an ability that permanently increases their Pools,
they can add a maximum of 1 point to their Might Pool and 1 point to
their Speed Pool; other points left over (if any)

must go to their Intellect Pool, even if that’s not normally an option
for the ability. This does not apply to the extra points the player can
divide among their Pools at character creation. This creates a more
“realistic” game scenario where the PCs are more like normal people who
don’t get much more powerful physically over the course of a campaign,
but still can learn new skills, advance their minds, and so on.

This module does not affect abilities like Enlarge (which temporarily
adds 4 points to your Might Pool), but it does affect abilities like
Enhanced Might, Enhanced Speed, and Lead From the Front (which
permanently increase one or more Pools).

GHOSTLY HELPERS 

In a horror story, it’s common for major characters to be killed or
incapacitated, but in a horror RPG, that means the player of a dead
character doesn’t have much to do. The Ghostly Helpers module gives
players whose characters are out of the game two ways to have an active
role in the scenario.

First, the dead character is still able to spend their XP to give a
living character a reroll. To facilitate this, the GM should allow
players to award the second 1

XP from a GM intrusion to a dead character (although this would come up
only if there is one character left alive and the second XP would be
wasted) and give dead characters 1 XP whenever there is a group
intrusion.

Second, the dead character is able to use their subtle cyphers to help a
living character. Depending on the cypher, this might be a direct
benefit to the PC (like easing a roll) or interfering with an NPC (like
making an opponent drop their weapon). When the GM gives out more subtle
cyphers, any excess ones (beyond the cypher limit of living PCs) should
go to the dead characters, up to the cypher limits of the dead
characters (any extra cyphers beyond that are lost).

The player of a dead character always gets to decide when to help and
which PC to affect with their help—they’re not merely extensions of the
living PCs. Whether this help is just fate or coincidence working on
behalf of the PC, or if it literally is the lingering ghost of a dead
character trying to save a living person, depends on the scenario and
the GM.

Help from a dead character doesn’t have to be from a ghost. Depending on
the genre, it might be the influence of a guilty artificial
intelligence, a sentient weapon with a grudge, a cultist with
conflicting loyalties, and so on

HALLUCINATION RESET

In some horror genres, it’s unclear if the character is truly
experiencing what’s happening in the story, or if they’re hallucinating
or dreaming it. In some cases, their fear response

to the real events happening around them prompts their conscious or
subconscious imagination to create an unreal scenario that’s even more
terrifying, only to have them snap out of it and find themselves in a
prior (but perhaps still very dangerous) situation. This sort of
hallucination allows the story to go completely off the rails and then
suddenly return to normal.

If the GM plans to have a hallucination reset, they should keep track of
damage taken, equipment used, and XP spent for each character (if using
cypher and XP cards, there should be a separate space for each
character’s used cards). When the hallucination ends, stop the action,
explain that the PCs find themselves at an earlier point in the story
(or wake up after some time has passed if it’s a dream), and restore
their Pools, equipment, and XP to their previous state. If the GM
doesn’t know exactly how much each character’s Pool changed, allow each
PC to make a free recovery roll to compensate for it.

If the GM needs to use a hallucination reset to recover from a
disastrous outcome, they should   try to reset the PCs as close as
possible to their previous state, relying on the players’ recollection
of which cyphers and XP belonged to each character. As it’s unlikely
that they kept track of how many Pool points they spent in the now-false
encounters, the GM can allow each of them a free recovery roll to make
up for it.

Used carefully, a hallucination reset leaves the characters wondering
what is real, and it can be a tool for the GM to rewind an encounter
that goes out of control or accidentally kills a character because of
poor rolls. Used too much, it risks causing the players to lose interest
in the game because the frequent resets undermine their emotional
connections to their characters and negate any progress in the story.

Note that a deliberate and planned reset can deliberately do strange
things with the story because it’s completely in the characters’ heads.
A horror game about werewolves might have a dream or hallucination about
fascist soldiers attacking the PCs with flamethrowers. One about aliens
might show the antagonists turning into sexy vampires. A haunted house
might convince the PCs that they’re tearing off their own faces. A
hallucination might even include elements of something that will happen
in the future, so when the actual event occurs (perhaps in a later
session) the players won’t know if they should act on their “future
memories” of these events or ignore them as falsehoods.

HORROR MODE

Horror Mode is an optional rule discussed in the Cypher System Rulebook.
When using this rule, the GM can escalate the tension by increasing the
range of numbers that trigger a GM intrusion: first on a roll of 1 or 2
instead of 1, then a roll of 1 to 3, then a roll of

1 to 4, and so on. The Escalation Rate table below shows what causes the
intrusion range to increase.

Horror Mode is unique among the horror modules in that the default
assumption is that the GM is using it for every horror game, at least
some of the time. Using Horror Mode makes the players aware of the risks
they take every time they make a roll. They won’t take easy tasks for
granted, and they might apply Effort to turn an easy task into a routine
task so they don’t have to roll at all and risk an intrusion. This ends
up depleting their Pools faster, which makes them feel more vulnerable.

HYSTERIA

Screaming is a natural reaction when you’re frightened, but it’s also
likely

to draw the attention of whatever is frightening you. The Hysteria
horror module encourages characters to give in to the natural instinct
to scream, but introduces dangerous consequences for doing so.

At any time, as an action, a PC can use a free one-action recovery roll
(which doesn’t use up the one-action recovery roll that all characters
get), but doing so means they also spend that action loudly screaming.
Because of this noise, the GM can make a free intrusion and doesn’t have
to award XP for it.

A PC’s ten-minute recovery roll takes only one minute, but the PC

has to scream and have an emotional meltdown for the entire time. As
with the previous option, this allows the GM to make a free intrusion
(after the recovery period) and they don’t have

to award XP for it. The PC still has the option of resting normally for
ten minutes to use the ten-minute recovery roll (without screaming, and
without the free intrusion).

In most situations that use Hysteria, the free intrusions involve
drawing the

attention of something that wants to harm the PCs or the sudden
appearance of something dangerous.

INSTANT PANIC

Most people in real life aren’t prepared for the existence of aliens,
monsters, or killer robots, and seeing something that shatters their
worldview is frightening and traumatic. The first time a character sees
a creature (or anything else suitably horrifying) they thought wasn’t
possible or only existed in books and movies, they must make an
Intellect defense roll against the creature’s level. If they fail, for
one round either they’re paralyzed with fear or they run in the opposite
direction.

Repeat appearances by the creature (or other creatures like it) that
they’ve seen before usually don’t trigger this reaction a second time,
but encountering a large number of those creatures or seeing them do
something unusual might trigger it. For example, seeing a ghoul crawl
out of a storm drain might trigger panic; seeing another ghoul (or the
same one again) won’t trigger it again, but seeing a large pack of
ghouls approaching, or seeing one ghoul eating a dead person could
trigger another panic reaction. Even if a character has gotten over
their initial panic, the GM can prompt it again as an intrusion if the
circumstances warrant it.

IRONMAN

There are no cyphers (subtle or manifest) or artifacts that heal, and
all other healing effects (such as recovery rolls and Healing Touch)
restore only the minimum amount possible. For example, a tier 2
character using a recovery roll would get only 3 points (as if they
rolled a 1 on a d6, plus 2 for their tier) to add to their Pools. This
results in a gritty, dire scenario where the only way PCs can restore
their Pools is with recovery rolls and character abilities that heal.

Cypher System characters are tough and resilient, even at tier 1, but
Ironman brings them down to a more realistic power level. Ironman is
more punitive for characters whose abilities cost Pool points and less
of a challenge for characters whose abilities don’t cost anything (such
as Physical Skills). For a slightly less challenging option, allow the
use of healing cyphers and artifacts, but limit them to the minimum
amount.

LAST SURVIVOR

Sometimes the antagonist kills off all the protagonists one by one,
leaving only one survivor to challenge them. In the journey toward that
point, it’s not clear who the last survivor will be, and sometimes a
potential last survivor is eliminated unexpectedly or sacrifices
themselves so that another person may live. The Last Survivor horror
module

is a way for PCs to temporarily thwart fate, but it inevitably feeds
toward the last surviving character having extra advantages when dealing
with the murderous antagonist.

When using this module, the GM places a token on the game table that
represents the last survivor, and puts a piece of paper (or an XP card)
underneath the token that represents 1 XP. Whenever there is a GM
intrusion, instead of giving 2 XP to a player and letting that player
award 1 XP to another player, the GM gives 1 XP to the chosen player,
and the other 1 XP is added to the last survivor token. Whenever there
is a group intrusion, 1 XP is added to the last survivor token (as if
the last survivor were a separate PC).

At any time, a player can decide that their PC becomes the last survivor
by picking up the token and its XP.

However, those XP belong to the role of the last survivor and always
remain separate from individual character XP. While a PC is the last
survivor, they gain the following benefits and restrictions:

• All rolls to save them from being killed are eased by two steps.

• The last survivor XP can be spent only by the last survivor, and only
on the last survivor’s rolls, never on any other players’ rolls. (The PC
can still spend their personal XP normally, including on other players’
rolls.)

• At any time, whoever has the token can pass the role of last survivor
to another player. The receiving player gets all the XP associated with
the last survivor (if there are none, the GM immediately gives 1 XP to
the token).

• Once a player has given up the role of last survivor, they can never
again be the last survivor.

• If the last survivor role has no XP left to spend, and there are no
other players to pass the token to (because everyone else has already
been the last survivor), the last survivor can pass the token to the GM
in exchange for their character getting 1 XP. Once this happens, the
last survivor token is removed from the game.

MADNESS

Madness is an optional rule discussed in the Cypher System Rulebook.
When using this rule, if Intellect damage from fear or shock reduces a
PC’s Intellect Pool to 0, they regain points in the Pool, but their
maximum Intellect Pool is reduced by 1. If their Intellect Pool is ever
reduced to 0 again, they go insane and replace their current descriptor
with the Mad descriptor.

PERILOUS VENTURE  
Sometimes the PCs need to perform a ritual or other complex action that
takes several rounds or minutes, and if they make mistakes along the way
it’s a setback instead of an outright failure. For example, they might
need to read a banishing spell out of an old book, mix and heat the
chemicals for a zombie cure, or draw a magic circle around a building to
contain hostile ghosts. Rather than having their success or failure come
down to one roll, the GM can build tension by requiring the players to
make multiple rolls called subtasks. The subtasks start at difficulty 1,
and the difficulty increases each time until the players make a final
roll at the highest difficulty (equal to the overall level of the
challenge, such as the demon they want to banish, the original zombie
virus, or the most powerful ghost attempting to leave the house).

Generally, these subtasks occur at equally divided intervals over the
course of the full time required to complete the ritual. If at any point
the PC fails a subtask, the ritual isn’t ruined, but it costs time—a
failure means the time spent on that subtask was wasted, but the
character can spend that much time again and try to succeed at that same
subtask.

Skills, assets, and other special abilities can ease subtasks just like
they do with any other task (which might make some of the subtasks
routine and not require a roll at all). Characters may apply Effort to
each subtask. Of course, applying Effort is something characters do in
the moment, not over long periods of time, so it’s generally impossible
to apply sustained Effort on a task or subtask that takes longer than a
day.

The GM should decide if a given ritual is something that other PCs can
help with. Even if it initially seems like a solo venture (like reading
a spell from a book), it might benefit from assistants who repeat a
chant, burn candles, perform arcane gestures, or just hold the acting
character upright as the ritual drains their strength. In general,
giving multiple PCs something to do is better than having everyone wait
on the sidelines while one character holds the spotlight.

To make the situation more interesting, the GM can introduce a time
challenge, like requiring the PCs to finish by a specific time (perhaps
a midnight deadline for containing the ghosts in the house, or banishing
a demon that’s inflicting damage to an NPC every round it possesses
them). This puts pressure on the PCs to complete the process as soon as
possible.

The GM can also add side effects for failed rolls or as intrusions. For
example, a weak spot in the salt line might allow one powerful ghost to
break free, an error in the banishing spell might painfully enrage the
demon and hinder the next subtask, electrical or magical energy might
lash out and harm a nearby character, and so on. The ritual might use up
quantities of

a limited resource, such as holy water, silver powder, or rare herbs; if
the PCs have only enough materials to complete the ritual (perhaps with
a little extra in case they make one mistake), that forces them to use
Effort, XP, and other tricks to make sure they don’t fail too often and
run out.

Finally, some rituals might require the PCs to spend points from their
Pools on each subtask, with Might representing blood or vitality, Speed
representing energy, and Intellect representing will or sanity. Other
physical or mental tolls could also require points from Pools. Multiple
PCs involved in the ritual could collectively contribute to this cost.

POOR CHOICES  
Sometimes people in horror do dumb things. They wander off alone to
investigate a weird noise. They abandon their friends and try to escape
in a rusty old car. They have sex in a spooky barn. These things usually
put them in danger and sometimes get them gruesomely killed. Using the
Poor Choices module means the GM can use intrusions to make the
characters do things that the audience of a horror movie would think are
stupid.

These intrusions work like the normal kind (the GM awards 2 XP, and the
player gives one of them to another player). However, while normal
intrusions are subtle changes that influence the situation, using Poor
Choices lets the GM abandon that restraint and dictate a specific overt
character action, even if it’s something that the player wouldn’t
normally choose.

These intrusions can be risky, but they shouldn’t be obviously
self-destructive or harmful. For example, the GM shouldn’t use an
intrusion to make a PC drink something that they know is poisonous, jump
out of an airplane without a parachute, punch a police officer, or stare
directly at an eclipse. The idea is to put the character in a
complicated situation more forcefully than the player might choose, but
not set up the character for failure. The players know they’re in a
horror scenario, but their characters don’t, and this helps prevent the
players from using metagame knowledge to keep the PCs out of trouble.
Another way to look at it is the characters should act as if they live
in a world where horror movies don’t exist, so they don’t know not to do
these things.

As with any GM intrusion, the player can choose to spend 1 XP to refuse
a Poor Choices intrusion, but they should consider accepting the
intrusion for the sake of the story, and because they’ll need the XP
later.

POOR CHOICES INTRUSIONS

The following are examples of GM intrusions to use with the Poor Choices
module.

A character investigates a strange noise on their own. (“It’ll be
fine!”)

• Two or more characters sneak off to have sex.

• A character leaves behind an important piece of equipment, such as a
weapon, phone, car keys, or their outer layer of clothes. (The GM can
use this intrusion after the fact when a player tries to use a specific
item.)

• A character gets drunk or high.

• A character falls asleep.

• A character slips away to urinate out in the woods or a nearby scary
building.

• A character doesn’t care that nearby animals are acting strange
(especially if they’re guard dogs).

• A character doesn’t shoot a dead monster in the head. (“We need to
save ammo.”)

• A character runs away into the dark or away from a place that would be
a better, safer direction to run.

• A character reads aloud words from the weird old book they found, or
they play an old recording of someone else reading the book aloud.

• In a multistory building, a character runs upstairs or down into a
basement (where they could get cornered) instead of outside where they
could escape in any direction.

• A character chooses a dumb or obvious hiding place, such as a closet
or under a bed.

• A character tries to escape by squeezing through a space that no human
could reasonably get through quickly, such as a doggie door or a tiny
window in a garage door.

• A character hides the fact that they’ve been bitten by a zombie, have
a weird rash like the one they saw on the walls of the alien spaceship,
or have been hearing a spooky voice telling them to kill their friends.
(“I’ll be okay.”)

• A character runs straight down the road to get away from a pursuing
vehicle (instead of onto the sidewalk, behind a big tree, or around a
tight corner).

• A prone or supine character crawls away from approaching danger
instead of getting up and running.

• A character doesn’t call the local authorities for help when they hear
something dangerous.

• A character ignores or rationalizes a weird noise. 

• A character jumps into the water—a lake, swimming pool, sacred
fountain, and so on.

• A character goes into the cave, mine shaft, or creepy house. (“I’m
just going to look around for a second.”)

• A character insists on staying behind while everyone else goes on
ahead. (“Someone should be here when the sheriff shows up!”)

• A character doesn’t check the back seat of a car before getting in and
starting it.

• A character ignores an obvious creepy clue that there’s something
wrong in the house, like a bloody axe, a room full of taxidermy animal
heads, or newspaper clippings about recent murders.

• While being pursued, a character calls for help or otherwise attracts
attention (like banging on store windows at midnight).

• A character tries to pet an unknown lifeform.

• A character tries to make peaceful contact with an obviously hostile
entity. (“It’s as frightened of us as we are of it!”)

• A character unlocks a door or disables a security system to let a
scared stranger into a safe area. 

• A character doesn’t bother to turn on the lights. 

• A character uses an action taunting their foe.

• A character follows a trail of blood.

• A character ignores good advice from a helpful and knowledgeable NPC.
(“That old lady was a superstitious kook.”)

• A character uses a firearm as a loud, ineffective solution for a
simple problem (like shooting a padlock).

• A character picks up a shady or outright scary-looking hitchhiker.

• A character scares another character (perhaps by grabbing their
shoulder unexpectedly and shouting) as a joke.

• A character momentarily forgets how to do a simple action, like open
or close a door.

• A character forgets to put their phone on silent mode. 

• A character imitates or makes fun of a creepy doll or statue.

• A character tries to help a child who has no reason for being there.

POSSESSION 

Some demons have the ability to possess a living creature, taking over a
character’s body as if it were the demon’s own. The demon must touch the
character to attempt possession (even if the demon’s touch normally
inflicts damage, the possession attempt doesn’t inflict damage). The
character must make an Intellect defense roll or become possessed,
whereupon the demon’s immaterial form disappears into the character.

The first round in which a character is possessed, they can act
normally. In the second and all subsequent rounds, the possessing demon
can try to control the actions of the host, but the character can
attempt an Intellect defense roll to resist each suggested action.
Successful resistance means that the character does nothing for one
round. When the demon isn’t trying to control its host, the character
can act as they choose. A possessing demon’s actions are limited to
controlling its host and leaving the host (the demon can’t use its own
abilities while in someone else’s body).

While it possesses another creature, the demon is immune to most attacks
(though not so the host; killing the host will eject the demon).

A possessed character is allowed an Intellect defense roll once per day
to try to eject the demon. The roll is hindered by one additional step
each day of possession after the first seven days. An ejected, cast-out,
or exorcised demon is powerless for one or more days. One way to
exorcise a demon is to command it out in the name of an entity that has
power over the demon. This can be attempted once per day and grants the
possessed character an additional Intellect defense roll to eject the
demon.

Other kinds of creatures (ghosts, beings of pure mental energy, and so
on) may have the ability to possess characters in the same way that
demons do.

SECRET TWIST

It’s common when tensions are high and lives are on the line that humans
get paranoid and start to turn on each other, interpreting stressed
behavior as suspicious and seeing enemies in the eyes of strangers. This
is compounded when there is an active threat that can disguise itself as
human (like an alien or demon) or take off a mask and pretend to be a
fellow prisoner or victim (like a chainsaw killer), only to reveal
themselves when the perfect opportunity comes along. These secret twists
are the source of many jump scares and unexpected betrayals that create
chaos and paranoia.

To use a secret twist, the GM first needs to decide three things:

• The secrets they want the PCs to keep from each other. Examples might
be “Your character is actually the shapechanging alien that is hunting
everyone on the spaceship,” “The chainsaw killer is the identical twin
of your character,” or “Another PC ruined your life but they don’t
realize who you are.”

• The best time to reveal the secret to the player involved. This might
be something the player learns before the game starts or a revelation
during the game. If there are multiple secrets, the players might learn
them at different times. For example, the PC whose life was ruined by
another character might know this at the start of the game, but another
PC might not know they had an identical twin (perhaps they were
separated at birth).

• The best time to reveal the secret to the other characters. The GM
might choose to push it out into the open (perhaps with a GM intrusion)
or let the player decide when to reveal it. For example, the GM decides
that walking into a dark room with a black light is how all the human
PCs realize that one character is really a shapeshifting alien with
UV-fluorescing skin, but the GM allows the PC whose family fortune was
stolen by another character to bring that up on their own (perhaps when
they’re alone with the thief).

If revealing the secret to the players is supposed to happen during the
game, it would be suspicious if only one player was pulled aside for a
conversation about it—the other players would know something unusual was
going on. Instead, the GM can call a quick break in the game and send
that player a text. Even better, the GM could send every player a secret
text so that nobody is singled out by having to read a text.
Alternatively, the GM can give a physical note to every player (perhaps
using the secret twist Special Cards); some of these notes might be
secrets and some innocuous, but the fact that everyone gets a note
disguises who might be getting a secret twist. By making sure that each
note has some kind of value (such as by letting a player trade it in
later for an asset or a subtle cypher), players who don’t receive a
special secret still spend a reasonable amount of time reading the note
and keeping it safe.

If the players are especially skilled at roleplaying, there may be
opportunities for multiple secret twists, especially those that change a
character’s identity. For example, in a scenario where there are
duplicates of the PCs walking around in their city (evil twins, clones,
aliens, or the like), the identity of individual characters might switch
from the originals to duplicates and back again several times during the
game.

Multiple shifts of identity are probably easier for the GM and players
to handle if they take place over several game sessions and each session
starts with players knowing exactly who they’re playing. It also helps
if the players take separate notes about what the original and the
duplicate know.

SHOCK

Shock is an optional rule discussed in the Cypher System Rulebook. When
using this rule, seeing something terrifying means a PC must make an
Intellect defense roll. The difficulty is based on the level of the
scary thing, or the GM can simply choose the level (see the Shock Levels
table). Failure on the defense roll means either the character takes
Intellect damage or

the player temporarily loses control of the character (the GM decides if
they scream, freeze, run, or take some other appropriate action, perhaps
with input from the player).

SHOCK LEVELS 

| Event                                                                                                   | Level          |

| A sudden loud noise (like a scream)                                                                     | 2              |
| Unexpectedly seeing a corpse                                                                            | 2              |
| Watching someone die                                                                                    | 3              |

| Witnessing something supernatural (like a spell)                                                        | 5              |
| Seeing something mind-bending (like an impossible, multidimensional demigod coalescing out of thin air) | 8              |

UNEASE

Horror isn’t always overt monstrosities trying to tear your limbs off or
drag your soul into Hell. Sometimes it’s something slightly off-putting,
a stretching of the norm, an itching behind your eyes, or a sinking
feeling in your stomach. You can feel that something is wrong, but you
don’t know exactly what, and you’re not sure what to do about it. Your
body isn’t sure if it should jump into fight or flight, so you’re
anticipating a spike of adrenaline and it’s very distracting.

With the Unease horror module, whenever a character is in the presence
of something disturbing that risks breaking their worldview, all their
actions are hindered. Normally this happens whenever the triggering
situation is within a short distance of the character, but the range
might vary depending on what the PC sees and the nature of the
disturbance. For example, a demon the size of a house might cause unease
whenever it’s within very long range, but a city-sized alien starship
hovering in the sky might affect people whenever they can see it even
though it’s a thousand miles away.

If the GM plans to have an ongoing Unease effect throughout an entire
game session (like an alien death fleet), they should consider using
physical reminders in the game area so players don’t forget its effects.
Over time, the GM might allow characters to become used to these
worrying sights, perhaps due to exposure or maybe by purchasing the
familiarity as a medium-term benefit.

Some creatures in the Cypher System already have the ability to make
others uncomfortable just by being in the same area, so if they are the
only weird creatures the GM plans to use in a horror game, there’s no
need for the Unease module.

In some ways, Unease is a more limited form of Instant Panic but can
also be used in tandem with it.

CONSENT

Horror games allow us to explore some pretty dark topics from the safety
of our own game tables. But before you do that, make sure everyone
around your table is okay with that. Find out what your players will
find “good uncomfortable,” which is something that makes us squirm in
our seats in a great horror movie, and “bad uncomfortable,” which is
something that actually makes a player feel nauseated, unsafe, or
offended. Being scared can be fun, but being sickened isn’t.

Consider the age and maturity of everyone in the game, perhaps in terms
of the movie rating system. Tell the players what you think the game
you’re running would be rated. If everyone’s okay with an R rating, then
fine. You can have a spooky game that’s on the level of a kids’ movie
rated G—more like *Scooby-Doo* than *Saw*, in other words. A PG rating
might be right for a game that’s more creepy than horrific, with ghosts
and spooky noises but not axe-wielding maniacs.

The different ratings suggest different kinds of content for your game.
Finding a dead body is horrible, but watching someone get decapitated is
something else entirely. Getting chased around by an alien that wants to
eat you is one thing, but having it gestate and burst out of your own
intestines is another. You need to know where the line is for everyone
participating, and you need to know it right from the beginning.

\* Creature found in the Cypher System Rulebook

Blob 8 (24)

The huge, undulating mass of this creature is composed of a mucus-like
solid. The half-amorphous blob defeats its foes by absorbing prey,
integrating a victim’s tissue into its own. In essence, the victim
becomes the blob, and all of the victim’s knowledge is available to the
blob for later use.

If it later desires, a blob can release a nearly perfect replicant of
any creature that it has absorbed. Replicants have the memories and
personalities of the originals, but they do the blob’s bidding, which is
usually to explore distant locations or lure prey into the open using a
friendly face. A particularly well-crafted replicant might not know it’s
not the original. Creating a replicant takes a blob a day or two of
effort, during which time it’s unable to defend itself or eat, so it’s
not a task the creature attempts lightly.

Motive: Assimilation of all flesh

Environment: Anywhere

Health: 66

Damage Inflicted: 8 points (acid gout)

Movement: Immediate; immediate when burrowing

Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to size

Combat: The blob can project a gout of acid at short range against a
single target. Though slow, a blob is always moving forward. A character
(or two characters next to each other) within immediate range of a blob
must succeed on a Might defense roll each round or be partly caught
under the heaving mass of the advancing creature. A caught victim
adheres to the blob’s surface and takes 10 points of damage each round.
The victim must succeed on a Might defense roll to pull free. A victim
who dies from this damage is consumed by the blob, and their body
becomes part of the creature.

If a blob has absorbed living flesh within the last hour, it regenerates
3 points of health per round while its health is above 0.

Interaction: A blob’s favored method of communication is to absorb
whoever tries to interact with it. If a replicant is handy, the blob
might talk through it if the blob can touch the replicant and use it
like a puppet.

Use: The old man the PCs accidentally hit with their vehicle has a
weird, mucus-like growth on one hand (in addition to the damage he
sustained in the accident). He probably should be taken to the hospital
to have his injuries and the quivering growth looked at.

Loot: A blob might have several cyphers swirling about in its mass that
it uses to equip replicants.

GM intrusion: The character pulls free of a blob they were caught under,
but a piece of quivering protoplasm remains stuck to their flesh. They
must do serious damage to themselves (enough to incapacitate) within the
hour, scraping off the protoplasm before it absorbs them and becomes a
new mini-blob.

Cryptic Moth 5 (15)

Normal moths are enigmatic, gauzy haunts of twilight. The feathery touch
of their wings on your face can startle, even frighten. This is to be
expected, since moths are the children of cryptic moths, malign and
intelligent entities of another realm. Sometimes referred to as mothmen,
other times as shadow faeries, cryptic moths are certainly alien. Each
possesses a unique wing pattern and coloration, and, to some extent,
body shape. These patterns

and colors may signify where in the hierarchy a particular cryptic moth
stands among its siblings of the night, but for those who do not speak
the language of moths, the complexity of their social structure is
overwhelming.

Motive: Capture humans, possibly for food, possibly for breeding
purposes

Environment: Almost anywhere, usually at night

Health: 23

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Movement: Short; long when flying

Modifications: All knowledge tasks as level 6; stealth tasks as level 7
while invisible 

Combat: Cryptic moths usually enter combat only when they wish, because
until they attack

and become visible, they can remain unseen and invisible to most eyes.
The touch of a cryptic moth’s wing draws life and energy from targets,
inflicting 5 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor).

Cryptic moths regain 1 point of health per round while their health is
above 0, unless

they’ve been damaged with a silvered or cold iron weapon, or by
electrical attacks. 

Once every hour or so, a cryptic moth can summon a swarm of normal moths
to aid

them in combat or, more often, serve as a fashion accessory or component
in a piece of living art.

Moth swarm: level 2

If a cryptic moth is prepared, it may carry cyphers useful in combat,
and perhaps even an artifact.

Interaction: Although very few cryptic moths speak human languages,
peaceful interaction

with these creatures is not impossible. It’s just extremely difficult,
as they see most

humans as a source of food or bodies to lay their eggs in.

Use: A character is followed by a cryptic moth intent on capturing and
enslaving them. 

Loot: A cryptic moth usually has a few cyphers, and possibly a delicate
artifact.

GM intrusion: The cryptic moth grabs the character and flies up and
away, taking the victim with them.

Elder Thing 8 (24)

Elder things are mostly extinct, but a few remain trapped in the
Antarctic ice or rule over crumbling cities in deep trenches at the
bottom of the ocean.

Beholding an elder thing bends the mind to the point of breaking. An
elder thing has a great barrel-like body standing some 8 feet (2 m)
tall. Knobby protrusions in the crown and base each unfold five
appendages that recall the arms of a starfish. When agitated, an elder
thing unfolds a pair of wings that help it flutter a limited distance.

Meddling by elder things created multicellular life that spread across
Earth billions of years ago and ultimately brought about humanity. As
the younger species grew in numbers and influence, the elder things went
into decline, a process hastened by wars against strange beings from
other worlds and uprisings by the servitor race they created, the
shoggoths.

Motive: Reclaim absolute sovereignty

Environment: In arctic regions or deep underwater

Health: 30

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Movement: Immediate; long when flying

Modifications: All tasks related to knowledge of magic or science as
level 10; Speed defense

as level 6 due to form

Combat: An elder thing can attack with five tentacles divided any way it
chooses among up

to three targets within immediate range. A target hit by a tentacle must
also succeed on a Speed defense roll or become grabbed until it escapes.
Each round, the elder thing automatically inflicts 6 points of damage on
each grabbed target until the victim succeeds on a Might defense roll to
escape. 

An elder thing can reach into the mind of a target within short
distance. If the target fails an Intellect defense roll, the elder thing
reads their thoughts while the target remains within long

distance. During this time, the elder thing knows everything the target
knows, hindering the target’s attack and defense rolls against the elder
thing. The elder thing can use an action to rend the target’s thoughts,
which inflicts 6 points of Intellect damage on a failed Intellect
defense roll. An elder thing can passively read the thoughts of up to
two creatures at one time.

An elder thing also might carry a few cyphers and an artifact it can use
in combat.

Interaction: An elder thing communicates through whistles and pops
created by moving air through tiny orifices arranged around its body.
Elder things see humans as a lesser form of life and may demand worship,
sacrifices, or something else from people it encounters.

Use: Fishermen return to a coastal village with a large block of ice in
tow. In the ice is something dark and large—an elder thing frozen alive.
If the thing thaws out, it will likely take over the community and
enslave the people living there.

Loot: An elder thing usually has one artifact and two or three cyphers.

GM intrusion: A character who sees an elder thing for the first time
goes temporarily crazy on a failed Intellect defense roll. They might
stand in place and gibber, run away, or laugh hysterically for a few
rounds. If the character takes damage, they shake off the temporary
madness. 

Fundamental Angel 7 (21)

Fundamental angels are mysterious holy beings that maintain and guard
fundamental concepts of the universe, such as time, gravity, and energy.
They have powers and agendas deriving from higher states of reality.
They are strange, terrifying, and inconstant in form, unlike the
relatively benign and comprehensible winged humanoids from religion and
myth.

In the rare times when mortals interfere with these concepts,
fundamental angels manifest in the world to set things right. They have
intervened to destroy cataclysmic atomic weapons, power sources that
skirt the rules of matter and energy, and life forms that betray the
principles of creation.

For the purpose of vampire aversions, the angel’s direct and area
attacks count as religious power or sunlight, whichever is worse for the
vampire.

Motive: Preserving the natural order

Environment: Anywhere, usually in response to mortal activity

Health: 35

Damage Inflicted: 8 points

Armor: 2 (+3 against energy)

Movement: Short; short when flying

Modifications: All knowledge as level 9; attacks against mad science and
supernatural targets as level 8

Combat: A fundamental angel attacks other creatures by creating a
long-range blast of

bright divine energy that inflicts 8 points of damage. In addition, it
automatically inflicts 4 points of damage each round against all
creatures within short range, although it can shield itself with wings
or other protrusions to negate this effect against individuals.

Any creature within long range that sees it and fails an Intellect
defense roll becomes frightened unless the angel tells it (specifically
or in general) not to be afraid.

As an action, it can teleport up to a hundred miles away or transport
itself fully to its native dimension where it exists as pure thought and
spirit.

Interaction: A fundamental angel operates on a mental and metaphysical
level far above humans and doesn’t bother to explain itself to anyone
other than its targets. It goes out of its way to not harm innocent
creatures. It can communicate with any creature that uses language.

Use: “FEAR NOT!” says the radiant being that appears out of nowhere. It
ignores bystanders and uses a beam of energy to destroy a scientist and
his experimental reactor.

Loot: Fundamental angels sometimes create or refresh subtle cyphers by
their mere presence.

GM intrusions:

A fundamental angel’s successful attack also blinds its opponent,
lasting until they make an Intellect defense roll (try once each round).

A fundamental angel makes a second attack this round against a target
that is adjacent to its primary target.

Hivemind Child 2 (6)

A hivemind family is a scouting expedition of part-alien creatures sent
to study and infiltrate human society, either out of scientific
curiosity or as a long-term plan for world domination or human
extinction. Some entities might intercept human astronauts,
reprogramming their DNA or attaching a parasite to their mind or soul.
Others might send a machine to

an isolated community, remotely impregnating some of the inhabitants to
gestate and give birth at the same time. The end result is a group of
hivemind children who have a psychic link, unusual powers, and loyalty
to their inhuman creators.

Hivemind children often have a very similar appearance even if they have
different parents—they might all have pale blond hair, unusually
wide-set eyes, six fingers on one hand, or an odd posture. They eerily
match each other’s expressions and movements. They think and speak as
children years older than they appear. Their emotional responses are
muted to an almost sociopathic extent.

Depending on their origin, the weird children may be mentored or
protected by an altered adult, or by human parents in denial about the
monsters they care for.

Motive: Conquest, exploration, infiltration

Environment: Human settlements

Health: 6

Damage Inflicted: 2 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Mental attacks and Intellect defense as level 3; defend
against attacks from

living creatures as level 3 due to mind reading; perception and
scientific knowledge as

level 4

Combat: Individually, hivemind children are physically no stronger or
more durable than

a typical human. Their true strength is in their ability to read and
control minds. Their telepathic link means that if one of them knows
something, all of them within long range automatically know it.

Hivemind children can automatically read the surface thoughts of anyone
they can

see within short range, even if the target is unwilling. As an action,
they can force

an intelligent living creature within short range to take a physical
action, including something that would cause the target harm, such as
forcing a target to stick their hand into boiling water, steer a moving
car off a cliff, or shoot themselves with a pistol (if used as an
attack, this inflicts damage equal to the hivemind child’s level or the
controlled creature’s level, whichever is greater).

Two hivemind children within short range of each other automatically
augment each other’s mental powers, allowing them to read or control
minds of two targets at once as a level 4 creature. Four within short
range of each other can read or control minds of four targets at once as
a level 5 creature, and eight or more can work together to read or
control minds of eight people as a level 6 creature.

Interaction: Hivemind children want to protect themselves and observe
humans and will try to do so until they appear as old as adults. Their
long-term goals are unclear but probably don’t have humanity’s best
interests in mind.

Use: Children born after a scientific expedition are strange and
different. Multiple small villages all over the world experience births
of children with weird abilities.

Loot: Hivemind children may have no useful items or one weird science
device they’ve built with their inhuman knowledge.

GM intrusions: 

A group of hivemind children briefly manifest a teleportation or
telekinesis ability

at the same level as their mind control.

The injury or death of one hivemind child angers the rest, increasing
their level and damage by +2 for one round.

Ighthsian 5 (15)

Ichthysians are thought to be aquatic evolutionary offshoots of hominids
or the result of experiments trying to fuse human and amphibian or fish
DNA. They are physically similar to humans standing fully upright, with
webbed hands, claws, froglike or fishlike features, gills, and strong
muscles from a lifetime of swimming. They live in the water but are
comfortable with extended forays onto land. Their intelligence is
between that of a smart animal and a human; they can use simple tools
such as rocks and sticks, and may build dams to modify waterways in
their territory.

Some ichthysians are reputed to have the ability to heal others, and
local villages may worship these beings as gods.

Motive: Hunger for flesh, curiosity, solitude 

Environment: Anywhere near bodies of fresh water Health: 18

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Armor: 2

Movement: Short on land; long in the water

Modifications: Strength-based tasks and swimming as level 6; defense
against poison as level 3

Combat: Ichthysians attack with their

powerful claws. They are less mobile on land and prefer to attack from
the water. If overmatched, they would rather flee to deep, dark water
than fight to the death.

An ichthysian regenerates 2 points of health each round as long as it
starts the round with at least 0 health. This regeneration greatly
extends their lifespan, and it is common for them to live to be more
than two hundred years old.

Ichthysians are prone to mutation, especially in response to pollutants
and other chemicals. These mutations might be physical deformities, but
could be as strange as transparent flesh, poisonous skin, extra eyes
with enhanced senses, or extra limbs.

Interaction: Ichthysians are not aggressive but will retaliate with full
force against anything that attacks them, and one can remember specific
enemy humans from its past.

Use: A cryptid fish-person has been spotted in the vicinity of a
deforested area adjacent to a mighty river. Villagers tell stories of an
ancient water god that heals sickness and grants wishes.

Loot: An ichthysian’s lair might have a strange relic or device that
works like a cypher or artifact.

GM Intrusions:

A slain ichthysian suddenly regenerates 5 health and immediately attacks
or tries to flee.

The ichthysian suddenly mutates in response to an attack, thereafter
gaining +2 Armor or +2 levels in defense against that type of attack.

Mummy 6 (18)

Mummies are intelligent undead, usually royalty or members of the
priesthood, risen from their burial places to destroy those who
disturbed their rest. Many seek to undo wrongs against them from ages
past or re-establish themselves in their former high stations. 

Motive: Vengeance, love, power

Environment: Regions where mummification was common Health: 24

Damage Inflicted: 7 points

Armor: 2

Movement: Short

Modifications: Climb, stealth, ancient history, and ancient religion as
level 8 

Combat: Mummies are strong, capable of lifting an adult human with one
hand and throwing the person across a room. They attack with weapons
that were buried with them or use their fists. A mummy usually has one
or more of the following abilities: 

Curse: Anyone who disturbs a mummy’s tomb must make an Intellect defense
roll or become cursed, which hinders their

actions by two steps (forever, or until cured). 

Disease: The mummy’s attacks carry a rotting disease. The target must
make a level 5 Might defense roll every twelve hours or take 5 points of
ambient damage.

Lifelike appearance: A mummy can repair its body to assume a fully human
appearance. This usually requires time and the flesh of several people,
often those who awakened it.

Magic: Once per hour, the mummy can cast a spell from the Minor Wish
character ability.

Minion: Animate up to four mummified bodies as mindless lesser mummies
or skeletons (depending on how well the bodies are preserved), lasting
for one day. 

Lesser mummy: level 3, climb and stealth as level 4; health 12; Armor 1

Swarm: Call a swarm of bugs (usually scarab beetles or scorpions) to
attack a foe or obscure vision.

Swarm of bugs: level 3

Interaction: Mummies want to destroy anyone who disturbs their burial
places. Ambitious mummies might choose living beings to be their spies
and servants, bribing them with funereal treasures or threatening them
into submission.

Use: Villagers whisper that a tomb has been opened and a mummy’s curse
will strike down anyone who gets in the creature’s way.

Loot: Mummies usually have treasures equivalent to three or four
expensive items and perhaps a handful of magical manifest cyphers or
even a magical artifact.

GM Intrusions:

A dying mummy speaks a curse upon those who killed it, hindering all
their actions by two steps (forever, or until cured).

What was overlooked as a fake or a prop turns out to be an actual mummy
and attacks a character.

Nightguant 3 (9)

A nightgaunt’s hands and feet have no opposable digits. All its fingers
and toes can grasp with firm but unpleasant boneless strength. Hungry
nightgaunts swoop out of the night, grab prey, and fly off into
darkness. The creatures sometimes “work” for other agencies, though
often enough, their goals are obscure.

Motive: Unknowable

Environment: Anywhere dark, usually in groups of four to seven

Health: 9

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Immediate; long when flying (short when flying with a victim)
Modifications: Perception and Speed defense as level 4; stealth

as level 7

Combat: A nightgaunt can attack with its barbed tail. To catch a foe, a
nightgaunt dives through the air from just outside of short range. When
it does, it moves 100 feet (30 m) in a round and attempts to grab a
victim near the midpoint of its movement. A target who

fails a Speed defense roll (and who isn’t more than twice the size of
the nightgaunt) is jerked into the creature’s boneless clutches and
carried upward, finding themselves dangling from a height of 50 feet (15
m).

The nightgaunt automatically tickles grabbed victims with its barbed
tail. This subtle form of torture hinders all the victim’s actions by
two steps.

Interaction: Nightgaunts never speak, and they ignore anyone who
attempts to interact with

them, whether the communication takes the form of commanding,
beseeching, or frantically pleading. Such is the way of nightgaunts.

Use: Someone who bears one or more of the PCs a grudge discovers a tome
of spells and summons a flight of nightgaunts, which set off in search
of their prey.

Loot: One in three nightgaunts has a valuable souvenir from a past
victim, which might be an expensive watch, a ring, an amulet, or
sometimes a cypher.

GM intrusion: The character is startled by the nightgaunt and suffers
the risk of temporary dementia. On a failed Intellect defense roll, the
character shrieks and faints (or, at the GM’s option, babbles, drools,
laughs, and so on). The character can attempt a new Intellect defense
roll each round to return to normal.

Reanimated 6 (18)

A reanimated is a humanoid creature patched together from corpses (or
crafted directly from muscle, nerves, and sinew), then returned to life
through a hard-to-duplicate series of electromagnetic induction events.
Though made of flesh, a reanimated’s return to consciousness and
mobility is marked by a substantial increase in hardiness, resistance to
injury, and longevity. On the other hand, the process usually
obliterates whatever mind was once encoded in the donor’s brain, giving
rise to a creature of monstrous rage and childlike credulity. Sometimes
the reanimated is bound to its creator in service, but such ties are
fragile and could be snapped by an ill-timed fit of fury.

Motive: Defense, unpredictable

Environment: Anywhere in service to a mad scientist, or driven to the
edges of civilization Health: 70

Damage Inflicted: 7 points

Movement: Short; long when jumping

Modifications: Speed defense as level 4; interaction as level 2; feats
of strength and toughness as level 8

Combat: A reanimated attacks foes with its hands. Any time a foe
inflicts 7 or more points of damage on the reanimated with a single
melee attack, the creature immediately lashes out in reactive rage and
makes an additional attack in the same round on the foe who injured it.

If the reanimated begins combat within long range of foes but outside of
short range, it can bridge the distance with an amazing leap that
concludes with an attack as a single action. The attack inflicts 4
points of damage on all targets within immediate range of the spot where
the reanimated lands.

Some reanimated are psychologically vulnerable to fire, and they fear
it. When these reanimated attack or defend against a foe wielding fire,
their attacks and defenses are hindered by two steps.

If struck by electricity, a reanimated regains a number of points of
health equal to the damage the electricity would normally inflict.

Interaction: Fear and food motivate a reanimated, though sometimes
beautiful music or innocence can stay its fists.

Use: Depending on where a reanimated falls along its moral and
psychological development, it could be a primary foe for the PCs, a
secondary guardian to deal with, or a forlorn beast in need of aid.

GM Intrusion:

The character’s attack bounces harmlessly off the stitched, hardened
flesh of the reanimated. 

Shoggoth 7 (21)

Shoggoths vary in size, but the smallest are usually at least 10 feet (3
m) across. They are the product of incredibly advanced bioengineering by
some strange species in the distant past. They are angry, vicious
predators feared by any who have ever heard of these rare creatures (or
who have encountered them and somehow survived to tell the tale). They
were created by the elder things but overthrew their masters and now
roam the vast, ancient cities they have claimed for themselves.

Rumors abound of a few very rare, particularly intelligent shoggoths
that intentionally reduce their own mass and learn to take on the forms
of humans so they can integrate themselves into society (and prey upon
humans at their leisure).

Motive: Hungers for flesh 

Environment: Anywhere

Health: 35

Damage Inflicted: 10 points

Armor: 10 against fire, cold, and electricity 

Movement: Long

Modifications: Speed defense as level 6 due to size 

Combat: Shoggoths sprout tendrils and mouths and spread their wide,
amorphous forms, allowing them to attack all foes within immediate
range. Those struck by a shoggoth’s attack are grabbed and engulfed by
the thing’s gelatinous body and suffer damage each

round until they manage to pull themselves free (engulfed creatures can
take no other physical actions while they are caught). Each round of
entrapment, one object in the victim’s possession is destroyed by the
foul juices of the amorphous horror.

Shoggoths regenerate 5 points of health each round. They have protection
against fire, cold, and electricity.

Interaction: A shoggoth can’t be reasoned with. 

Use: The PCs find an ancient structure of metal and stone. Wandering
through it, they note

that every surface is clear of dirt and debris. Soon they discover why—a
shoggoth squirms through the halls, absorbing everything it comes upon
(and it fills the passages it moves down, floor to ceiling, wall to
wall).

Loot: A shoggoth’s interior might contain a cypher.

GM intrusion: The character is engulfed in the shoggoth, their gear
scattered throughout the thing’s undulating form, and their body turned
upside down so that escape attempts are hindered.

Yithian 6 (18)

The yithians (also known as the Great Race of Yith) were immense wrinkly
cones 10 feet (3 m) high, with a head, four limbs, and other organs
spreading from the top of their body. They communicated by making noises
with their hands and claws, and they moved by gliding their lower
surface across a layer of slime, like a slug. Their civilization was
destroyed a billion years before the present day, but they transported
their minds into new bodies far in the future and may still be
encountered observing the past (our present) by telepathically
inhabiting human bodies.

Motive: Knowledge Environment: Anywhere Health: 22

Damage Inflicted: 6 points Armor: 2

Movement: Short

Modifications: All knowledge as level 8; Intellect defense as level 7;
Speed defense as level 5

due to size and speed

Combat: Although large and hardy, members of the Great Race are
ill-suited to physical

combat. If they must engage in melee, they use pincer-like claws. They
almost always wield artifacts and cyphers, however, which makes them
dangerous opponents. Assume that a yithian has one or more of the
following abilities arising from advanced technology devices:

• Force field that grants them +3 Armor

• Mental field that gives them +4 Armor against any mental attack

• Ray emitter that inflicts 7 points of damage up to long range

• Cloaking field that renders them invisible for up to ten minutes

• Stun weapon with short range that makes the target fall unconscious
for ten minutes

Yithians have the ability to transfer their consciousness backward or
forward through time, swapping minds with a creature native to the era
they wish to observe. A yithian inhabiting the body of another creature
is in complete control of that body. A creature trapped in the body of a
yithian must attempt Intellect-based tasks each time it wishes to exert
control.

For the most part, it is trapped in the yithian’s body and is merely
along for the ride.

It’s worth noting that the bodies the yithians use are not their
original bodies, but instead the bodies of supremely ancient creatures
that they inhabit. The Great Race hails originally from some
extraterrestrial world.

Interaction: Yithians are not malicious, but they are quite focused and
relatively uncaring about other races, such as humans.

Use: A yithian projects its mind across the aeons, swapping
consciousnesses with the character. While controlling the character’s
body, the yithian is there mainly to learn and observe, and rarely takes
any violent actions.

Loot: A yithian encountered in the flesh will have 1d6 manifest cyphers
and very likely a technological artifact.

GM intrusion: 

The yithian produces a cypher that has a function that is perfect for
its current situation: a teleporter to get away, a protective field
against precisely the kind of attack being used against it, or a weapon
that exploits a weakness of the character’s.

NPCs 

Cannibal 3 (9)

A cannibal is someone who has decided that eating other people is not
only necessary but desirable. Whether this decision was forced by
circumstance or made out of some secret, maladaptive urge, cannibals are
dangerous because they hide in plain sight, pretending friendship and
aid for strangers until their prey lowers their guard. That’s when a
cannibal strikes. Some cannibals like it raw; others delight in
elaborate preparations.

Motive: Hungers for human flesh 

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Movement: Short

Modifications: Deception, persuasion, intimidation, and tasks related to
friendly interaction as level 6

Combat: Cannibals use whatever weapon is at hand. They usually don’t
attack unless they can surprise their prey. When cannibals have
surprise, they attack as level 5 creatures and inflict 2 additional
points of damage.

Interaction: Cannibals seem friendly and charming until they decide you
are for dinner. Use: Characters looking for a place to sleep, hide, or
stay for the night are invited in by one

or more cannibals—perhaps an entire family of them.

Loot: A cannibal has currency equivalent to a very expensive item and
possibly a cypher.

GM intrusion: The cannibal reveals a severed and gnawed- upon body part
of a previous victim. The character must succeed on an Intellect defense
task or be stunned and lose their next turn.

Mad Scientist 4 (12)

A mad scientist is someone who delves into areas of science best left
unexamined, abandoning ethics and pushing for what can be created
without asking if it should be. 

Motive: Understanding and exploiting reality

Environment: Usually in a lab

Health: 15

Damage Inflicted: 7 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Defends as level 6 due to a gadget (or cypher); knowledge
of advanced

science as level 7

Combat: Mad scientists are usually accompanied by security guards,
robots, zombies, or

some other appropriate creature. A mad scientist can attempt to take
command of an enemy’s technological device (armor, a weapon, a cypher, a
robot, and so on) within short range for up to one minute using a
handheld device.

Mad scientists usually have access to a long-range energy or
high-velocity weapon that inflicts 7 points of damage. They often carry
manifest cyphers that increase Armor, confuse opponents’ senses, or
transform themselves into a form that eases all their actions by two
steps.

Interaction: Mad scientists are narcissistic and love to monologue about
their work. They negotiate but usually are sociopathic and don’t care
about other people. Some are filled with self-loathing but too far gone
to feel they can change.

Use: Blackouts and strange noises have been traced to a location found
to hold a secret lab where a scientist is creating something amazing and
monstrous.

Loot: Mad scientists have a few manifest cyphers and possibly an
artifact.

GM intrusion: The mad scientist produces a gadget or cypher that proves
to be the perfect answer to a dilemma at hand.

HORROR ARTIFACTS

Most of the time, a horror artifact will be something really weird—an
ancient tome of forbidden necromancy, an alien device that humans can
barely understand, and so forth. They are often unique items rather than
one of a type. Horror artifacts should probably come with a risk, such
as a built-in cost, a drawback, or something else that makes using them
another way to heighten the tension of the game. Several examples are
below.

BOOK OF INVERSION

Level: 8

Form: Very large book of ancient providence, the cover bound in iron and
wrapped in chains with a level 6 padlock

Effect: When opened, the Book of Inversion shows a pair of pages that
detail a magic spell in the reader’s language, complete with disturbing
diagrams. The spell’s effect varies, but it is always some kind of
horrible attack—a target is driven mad, a target is turned inside out, a
target seeks to murder their best friend, several targets are cursed
with a rotting disease, and so forth. The reader can automatically cast
the spell as an action, one time only. More insidiously, if successful,
the spell confers pleasure to the caster and fully restores all of their
Pools. The caster must make an immediate Intellect defense roll or be
compelled to use the book (and thus a new spell) again the next day.
This compulsion is so strong that the caster will kill their dearest
loved one to complete the task. If they are unable to use the book
again, they are driven permanently mad. Woe to the caster who uses the
book on the last time before it is depleted (at which point it crumbles
to dust).

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

SHADOW BOX

Level: 7

Form: Wooden and black metal box, about 12 inches by 7 inches by 3
inches (30 by 18 by 8 cm), with a hinged lid and a clasp

Effect: When the box opens, shadows seethe out. These shadows coalesce
into a form that best represents a deep fear in the subconscious of the
person who opened the box. The opener must make an Intellect defense
roll to master the shadow thing, which then acts as a level 7 creature
under their control for five rounds before fading away. If the roll
fails, the creature attacks the opener and anyone else around. To make
matters worse, the opener spends the first round frozen in terror, doing
nothing.

Depletion: 1–2 in 1d6

SPHERE 23

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: A 7-inch (18 cm) sphere of what appears to be fluid metal, tinted
red

Effect: Possibly one of a number of identical alien artifacts recovered
in remote locales across the earth, the so-called sphere 23 will grant a
wish to anyone who holds it and uses an action to concentrate on it. The
wish can be anything, including something that bends reality: raising
the dead, altering time, and so forth. However, the wisher must
immediately make a Might defense roll or be consumed by the sphere. If
the roll succeeds, they must then make an Intellect defense roll or be
driven permanently and irrevocably mad.

Depletion: 1–3 in 1d6

HORROR CYPHERS

Many horror genres feature physical objects that the protagonists can
use—alien devices, magical talismans, or mysterious objects with an
unknown origin. This chapter describes examples of these objects as
cyphers, which can be awarded like other manifest cyphers or in place of
subtle cyphers. Unlike those in the Cypher System Rulebook, the manifest
cyphers listed here include suggestions for what form the cypher takes
(although in a game with magic, any of these cyphers might exist as a
potion or spell on a scroll in addition to or instead of the forms
listed here).

Most of these are marked as fantastic cyphers, although depending on the
genre and circumstances of the game, they might be completely normal.

For your convenience, the cyphers have been organized into lists by
horror genre or theme so you can randomly roll for something appropriate
to your game without getting one that doesn’t apply (such as a cypher
against vampires in an alien invasion horror game). If you’re running a
game that mixes several genres, switch between lists each time you need
to award a new manifest cypher.

A SELECTION OF HORROR CYPHERS

ANATHEMA SIREN

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Amulet or device

Effect: Creates a strange and annoying noise about the volume of a human
shouting. The noise is especially aggravating toward one type of
creature; creatures of this type have all their actions hindered by two
steps (hindered by three steps if the cypher level is 7 or higher) while
within short range of the cypher. The user must use their action each
round to manipulate the cypher for the noise and its effects to persist,
or it goes silent and loses all power. The siren can be used for up to
one minute per cypher level. Roll a d100 to determine what sort of
creature is affected:

| 01-10 | Aliens (probably one specific kind of alien) |
|-------|----------------------------------------------|
| 11-16 | Animate dolls and puppets                    |
| 17-22 | Cryptids                                     |
| 23-32 | Demons                                       |
| 33-28 | Doppelgangers                                |
| 39-48 | Ghosts                                       |
| 49-54 | Mummies                                      |
| 55-64 | Robots                                       |
| 65-70 | Simulacra                                    |
| 71-80 | Vampires                                     |
| 81-90 | Werewolves (or some other werecreature)      |
| 91-95 | Extradimensional creatures                   |
| 96-00 | Undead                                       |

ASCENDANT BRAIN VIVISECTOR

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Device, injection, or pill 

Effect: If used on a beast whose level is less than the cypher level,
this enhances connections in the beast’s brain so it attains near-human
intelligence and sapience, and gains a basic understanding of one
specific language keyed to the cypher. The beast remembers its prior,
simpler existence and understands that it has been made smarter. This
transformation lasts for one day per cypher level, and then the beast
reverts to its normal self slowly over the same number of days, often
with violent and erratic outbreaks. For example, if the beast becomes
smarter for five days, it loses intelligence gradually over days 6
through 9 and is back to normal on day 10. Additional uses of the cypher
tend to have diminishing returns.

When used with an ascendant flesh vivisector, the resulting creature
looks, thinks, and acts like a human.

Using this cypher on a beast whose level is too high might end up
elevating its intelligence somewhat but also instigating aggressive
behavior.

ASCENDANT FLESH VIVISECTOR

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Device, injection, or pill 

Effect: If used on a beast of no larger than human size whose level is
less than the cypher level, this radically alters the beast’s shape so
it resembles a human being. The beast-human still thinks and acts like a
beast, but it looks like a human and can perform actions using its human
dexterity (such as turning a doorknob or walking upright). This
transformation lasts for one day

per cypher level, but after an equal amount of time the beast reverts to
its normal shape (in the manner described for the ascendant brain
vivisector cypher). Additional uses of the cypher tend to have
diminishing returns.

Using this cypher on a beast whose level is too high might end up
temporarily transforming it into a human with bestial features.

ORRUPTED CANOPIC JAR

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Jar made of clay or carved stone 

Effect: Breaking open the jar (which destroys the preserved organs
inside) permanently grants the user an asset (two assets if the cypher
level is 6 or higher) on all attacks and defenses against mummies within
short range.

ECAPITATIVE LONGEVITY

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Injection or potion

Effect: Brings a dead creature’s head (but not the body) back to life
for a limited time as an undead creature. The cypher can be used up to
an hour before or after death (in anticipation of dying or in response
to someone’s death) and requires up to ten minutes to take effect, at
which time the creature recovers 1d6 + 6 points to their Pools. Because
they are only a head, a PC reanimated this way has a maximum Might and
Speed Pool of 3 each. The head has all the mental abilities they had
when they were alive (including psychic or telepathic abilities) and can
speak, but all their actions are hindered. They have the same appearance
as before, except the wounds that killed them are still visible, and in
general they have an unnatural look. They do not need to eat, drink, or
sleep, but they can still rest if they want to (such as to make a
recovery roll). The head remains in this active state for one day per
cypher level, after which time it dies again and cannot be reanimated
with this cypher.

When using a decapitative longevity cypher to bring a head back to life,
it can be left attached to the inert body, or someone can carefully
sever the head from the body, which doesn’t harm the head.

GHOST DETECTOR

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Amulet, crystal, or device 

Effect: Automatically indicates if a ghost, spirit, or similar entity is
within a short distance (a long distance if the cypher is level 6 or
higher). If the user takes an action to study or focus their attention
on the cypher, they can narrow down what quarter-arc of a circle the
ghost is

in. If the ghost is normally invisible, it becomes somewhat visible
(hindering its stealth attempts by one step). The cypher remains active
for ten minutes per cypher level.

GHOST TRAP

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Crystal or device

Effect: Can be thrown up to a short distance, where it releases a burst
of transdimensional energy in an immediate area that absorbs ghosts
(including spirits, phased beings, and similar creatures) but does not
affect corporeal entities. PCs who meet these criteria must use an
Intellect-based action (difficulty equal to the cypher level) to avoid
being trapped. NPC ghosts are not affected if their level is higher than
the cypher level. The trap holds the ghosts for up to one hour per
cypher level, after which they automatically break free (and are
probably very angry).

Ghosts in a trap can be permanently stored in a ghost vault. 

HOMUNCULUS FLASK

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Ornate, opaque alchemical bottle filled with strange fluid

Effect: To activate this cypher, you must open the bottle, add a few
fresh drops of your blood (inflicting 1 point of Might damage to you),
stopper it again, and leave it alone for one day. When the bottle is
next unstoppered, a hand-sized creature called a homunculus crawls out;
it vaguely resembles you and serves you for one day per cypher level
before dissolving into useless goo. Each time you give it an order, you
must make an Intellect defense roll against it; if you fail, it becomes
free to ignore your commands (but might pretend to be obedient so it can
plot against you).

Homunculus: level 2; alchemy, all defenses, and stealth as level 3

HORRIFIC ARM

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Injection or pill

Effect: The user’s body rapidly grows a monstrous arm that is
approximately the same size as one of their existing limbs. The arm is
ugly and malformed, but fully functional.

The user can use this arm as if it were one of their own. The new arm
does not grant the user additional actions or attacks in a round, but it
can be useful for carrying things. Damage to the arm does not affect the
user (the arm can take 6 points of damage directed at it before it
becomes nonfunctional). The arm lasts for one day per cypher level.

HORRIFIC EYE

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Injection or spell

Effect: The user’s body rapidly grows a monstrous eye (including a
retractable eyestalk if the cypher level is 6 or higher) at the spot
where the cypher is applied to their body. The user can see out of this
eye as if it were one of their own (including any extraordinary
vision-based senses the user normally has). The eye gives the user an
asset on vision-based perception rolls, and depending on where it is
located, it may allow the user to look around corners surreptitiously.
Damage to the eye does not affect the user (the eye can take 1 point of
damage directed at it before it becomes nonfunctional). The eye lasts
for one day per cypher level.

HORRIFIC FACE

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Injection or pill

Effect: The user rapidly grows a monstrous face (or an entire head if
the cypher level is 6 or higher) somewhere on their body. The user can
use the senses of this face and talk, breathe, and eat with it (for
example, if their normal face is underwater or wrapped in plastic). The
face gives the user an asset on perception rolls when its senses can be
used—for example, it could hear someone sneaking up on the user, but it
couldn’t see them if its eyes were covered, and it can’t help with
identifying tastes unless its mouth is also used. Damage to the face
does not affect the user (the face can take 3 points of damage directed
at it before it becomes nonfunctional). Most people react with disgust
to a creature with a visible extra face, hindering all interaction
tasks. The face lasts for one day per cypher level (two days if the
cypher is level 6 or higher).

HORRIFIC INTEGRATED WEAPON

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Weapon you can hold in one hand 

Effect: The weapon extends tendrils, skin, wires, nerves, or other
material into and through the user’s hand, physically connecting itself
to the user for one hour per cypher level. While connected, the user
gains an asset on attacks with the weapon and cannot be disarmed, but
cannot use that hand for anything except wielding the weapon. The user
can detach or reattach the weapon by spending a full minute
concentrating on its physical connection to their body. When the
duration ends, the weapon detaches and becomes a normal weapon of its
type. Roll a d20 to determine the kind of weapon:

| 1-4   | Hunting knife  |
|-------|----------------|
| 5-8   | Machete        |
| 9-12  | Nightstike     |
| 13-16 | Light handgun  |
| 17-20 | Medium handgun |

HORRIFIC ORIFICE

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Device, injection, or pill  

Effect: The user’s body rapidly grows a strange orifice in their torso,
large enough to fit a human fist but flexible enough to hold a compact
disc or videocassette tape. One cypher held within the orifice doesn’t
count toward the user’s cypher limit. As an action, the user can cause
the orifice to appear or disappear (when the orifice isn’t present,
anything contained within it is inaccessible except through surgery).
The orifice remains for one hour per cypher level, after which it expels
its contents and disappears.

Someone who fully understands how a horrific orifice cypher works might
be able to program the user with new memories or control their mind by
inserting data devices into the orifice.

HUMANITY TESTER

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Device, injection, or pill 

Effect: Reveals whether a targeted creature is human or some sort of
inhuman impostor (such as an alien, demon, doppelganger, simulacrum, or
vampire) if the cypher’s level is greater than the creature’s disguise
level. If the cypher’s level exceeds the impostor’s level by 4 or more,

it also marks the impostor for the next several hours so people can
recognize it by this mark.

The specific nature of a humanity tester depends on the setting and what
sort of creatures are common. In a world with multiple kinds of
creatures that pretend to be human, the tester might recognize all fakes
or detect only one specific kind of fake

INSANITY SUPPRESSOR

Level: 1d6

Form: Device, injection, or pill

Effect: Temporarily negates insanity or a mental disorder in a creature
(two such effects if the cypher level is 6 or higher). Example disorders
include delusions, manias, compulsions, phobias, psychopathy, and
schizophrenia. The creature loses all negative symptoms of their
insanity or mental disorder for one day. Each day after that, the
creature must make a level 1 Intellect defense roll to prolong the
effect; failure means relapse. The roll is hindered by one step for each
day that has passed since the cypher was used.

INVISIBILITY REVEALER

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Device containing a liquid or silvery powder

Effect: Sprays its contents up to a long distance, revealing all
invisible creatures within short range of the targeted point for one
round per cypher level. Affected invisible creatures remain visible if
they move outside the area, and those outside the area become visible if
they enter the area.

INVISIBILITY SERUM

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Device, flask, or injection 

Effect: The user’s body becomes as transparent as air, making them
effectively invisible for one minute per cypher level. However, their
clothes and equipment are not affected, so the user must go naked if
they want to be unseen. While invisible, the user is specialized in
stealth and Speed defense tasks. They remain invisible even if they do
something to reveal their presence or position (attacking, using an
ability, moving a large object, and so on), but anyone trying to attack
or physically interact with them on that turn gains an asset to do so.

Because the user is as transparent as air, when they are in water, mist,
smoke, or anything other than reasonably clean air, they look like a
person-shaped hole in whatever material they’re in.

The serum has detrimental effects on the mind. Each minute it is in
effect, the user takes 2 points of Intellect damage. Many users have
become “stuck” in the invisible state and eventually go mad as a result.

MIND SWAPPER

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Amulet or device

Effect: The user attempts to swap minds with a creature within short
range that is no larger than a human. The target can make an Intellect
defense roll to resist. If the swap is successful, the user gains
control of the creature’s body (and vice versa). Physical abilities
remain with the body, but mental abilities go with the mind; for
example, an Adept with Onslaught (a mental ability) could take over the
body of a Warrior with Swipe (a physical ability), and could use either
of these while controlling the Warrior’s body. All actions of both
creatures are hindered while the swap is in effect, although long-term
practice in a mind-swapped body eventually overcomes this penalty. The
swap lasts for one hour per cypher level, after which the two minds
return to their previous bodies.

Clever users of a mind swapper have an ally restrain or sedate them
before swapping minds so their target doesn’t cause trouble in the
user’s body.

PRIMITIVE DOPPELGANGER

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Device, injection, or pill

Effect: The user’s body begins growing a physical duplicate of the user,
which harmlessly tears free after a few rounds and exists as an
independent level 1 creature that looks exactly

like the user. The doppelganger can communicate in a language known to
the user and obeys the user’s simple instructions, but otherwise appears
to know very little of the world. After one hour per cypher level, the
duplicate dies, melts, burns out, falls apart, or otherwise becomes
nonfunctional.

Depending on the game setting, the doppelganger might be a robot, a
clone, a temporal duplicate, or something else entirely. It may or may
not have scars, tattoos, or other non-genetic features of the original.

REANIMATOR

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Amulet or injection

Effect: When used on a corpse of a creature no larger than a human, it
reanimates as a violent zombie that is not under the user’s control.
This reanimation process takes a few minutes (a few rounds if the cypher
is level 4 or higher, or one round if level 6 or higher).

REVENANT SERUM

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Injection or potion

Effect: Brings a dead person back to life for a limited time as an
obsessed creature called a revenant. The cypher can be used up to an
hour before or after death (in anticipation of dying or in response to
someone’s death) and requires up to an hour to take effect, at which
time the creature recovers 1d6 + 6 points to its Pools. The new revenant
is usually obsessed with revenge on its killer or accomplishing one last
task before truly dying again.

A revenant has all the abilities it had when it was alive, but all its
actions are hindered. It has the same appearance as before, except the
wounds that killed it are still visible, and in general it has an
unnatural look. It does not need to eat, drink, or sleep, but it can
still rest if it wants to (such as to make a recovery roll). The
revenant remains in this active state for one hour per cypher level,
after which it dies again and cannot be reanimated with this cypher.

SILGARHO INFUSION

Level: 1d6

Form: Flask or injection

Effect: Suffuses the user’s body with a mixture of colloidal silver
(sil), concentrated garlic (gar), and holy water (ho), making the user
repellent to most vampires, which usually have an aversion to one or
more of these materials. Vampire attacks with melee weapons against the
user are hindered. Any PC vampire who attempts to feed on the user gains
no sustenance and must make a Might defense roll or feel nauseous and
have all their actions hindered for one minute. Any NPC vampire who
attempts to feed on the user gains no sustenance and all their actions
are hindered for one minute. The cypher’s effect persists in the user’s
body for one day (two days if the cypher is level 4 or higher).

If used directly against a vampire instead of being applied to a living
creature, it affects the vampire as silver, garlic, and holy water
normally would.

Because a human body can’t dispose of colloidal silver, excessive intake
of it causes a condition called argyria that turns skin purple or
purple-grey

UNPHANTOMED LIMB 

​​Level: 1d6

Form: Device, injection, or pill 

Effect: Gives a user who is missing a

limb the ability to create a psychic construct in the form of a limb
(two limbs if the cypher level is 5 or higher) that takes the place of
and functions like their missing limb (or limbs). The unphantomed limb
looks and acts like a typical healthy specimen of its kind, including
having fingerprints. However, its motion is controlled by the user’s
will rather than by muscles and nerves, so any physical action the limb
takes is an Intellect task instead of a Might or Speed task; for
example, a melee attack with the unphantomed limb is an Intellect task,
and to apply Effort, the user must spend points from their Intellect
Pool. Damage to the limb affects the user as if the attack were on the
user’s body. The limb lasts for one day per cypher level.

VISAGE SCRUTINIZER

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Device, crystal, injection, or pill 

Effect: Grants the user a heightened

ability to see disguised people and creatures for what they really are.
Tasks to see through conventional disguises (makeup, prosthetics, wigs,
and so on) are eased by three steps. If the disguise is instead a
comprehensive change like a full-body illusion, mental projection, or
hologram, the user automatically sees through it if the disguise’s level
is lower than the cypher’s level. The cypher lasts for one hour.

WOLFSBANE POTION

Level: 1d6

Form: Flask or injection

Effect: Suffuses the user’s body with a mixture of colloidal silver and
wolfsbane, making the user repellent to werewolves (and similar
werecreatures). Wolfsbane is poisonous, and using this cypher inflicts
Speed damage and Intellect damage equal to the cypher’s level. Werewolf
attacks with melee weapons against the user are hindered. Any werewolf
who attempts to feed on the user feels nauseous and all its actions are
hindered for ten minutes. The cypher’s effect persists in the user’s
body for one day (two days if the cypher is level 4 or higher). If used
directly against a werewolf instead of being applied to a living
creature, it hinders all the werewolf’s actions and stops it from
regenerating for several minutes.

USING GM INTRUSIONS IN HORROR MODE

With the GM intrusions coming fast and furious toward the end of Horror
Mode, it’s easy to run out of ideas. In combat, intrusions might just
mean that the monster or villain gets a surprise extra attack or
inflicts more damage. Perhaps a PC is thrown to the ground or nearer to
the edge of a cliff. If the characters are running away, one might trip
and fall. If the PCs are exploring, a bookcase topples, potentially
hitting someone. Think of all the similar moments you’ve seen in horror
films.

Sometimes, if the GM prefers, the GM intrusion can simply be something
frightening, like a moan or a whisper. These aren’t dangerous to the
PCs, but they escalate the tension and indicate that something bad is
getting closer.

In fact, while in Horror Mode, GMs should mostly refrain from doing
anything bad, ominous, or dangerous unless it’s an intrusion (either
from a die roll or through the awarding of XP). In a horror game, GM
intrusions are an indication that things are bad and getting worse, and
whenever possible, the GM should allow the Horror Mode escalation to
drive the action. This makes the GM more of a slave to the dice than in
other Cypher System situations, but that’s okay.

Consider this example. The PCs have tracked something that is probably
committing a series of horrific murders to an old factory. They enter
the building to explore. The GM knows where the creature is hiding in
the factory, but decides that it doesn’t become aware of the characters
until an intrusion is indicated. The only clue the PCs have is a
mysterious noise off in the darkness. The creature doesn’t move toward
them until another GM intrusion occurs. Now they hear something dragging
across the factory floor, coming closer. But it’s not until a third
intrusion occurs that the creature lunges out from behind an old machine
at the PC who rolled the die.

In some ways, the status quo doesn’t change until an intrusion happens.
This could be seen as limiting the GM and the need for pacing, but
remember that the GM can still have an intrusion occur anytime they
desire, in addition to waiting for the low die rolls.

(GMs may want to limit the number of intrusions to no more than one per
round, no matter what the dice indicate, but that should be based on the
situation.)

OPTIONAL RULE: MADNESS

Having characters descend into madness is an interesting facet of some
kinds of horror and can make long-term horror campaigns more
interesting. The easiest way to portray blows to a character’s sanity is
through Intellect damage. When PCs encounter something shocking, as
described above, they always take Intellect damage. If they would
normally move one step down the damage track due to the damage, they
instead immediately regain points (equal to 1d6 + their tier) in their
Intellect Pools but lose 1 point from their maximums in that Pool.
Characters whose Intellect Pools reach 0 go insane. They lose their
current descriptor and adopt the Mad descriptor, regain 1d6 + tier
points to their Intellect Pools, and gain +1 to their Intellect Edge. If
they ever reach a permanent Intellect Pool maximum of 0 again, they go
stark raving mad and are no longer playable.

Intellect Edge offers an interesting means to portray a character who is
knowledgeable (and perhaps even powerful in terms of mental abilities)
yet mentally fragile. A character with a low Intellect Pool but a high
Intellect Edge can perform Intellect actions well (since Edge is very
helpful) but is still vulnerable to Intellect damage (where Edge is of
no help).

Since Cypher System games are meant to be story based, players should
recognize that the degrading sanity of their character is part of the
story. A player who feels that their character is going mad can talk to
the GM, and the two of them can work out the means to portray
that—perhaps by using the Mad descriptor, permanently trading up to 4
points from their Intellect Pool to gain +1 to their Intellect Edge, or
anything else that seems appropriate. Mental disorders, manias,
psychopathy, schizophrenia, or simple phobias can be added to a
character’s traits, but they don’t need to be quantified in game
statistics or die rolls. They’re simply part of the character.

Inabilities in personal interaction or any area requiring focus might be
appropriate, perhaps allowing the PC to gain training in weird lore or
forbidden knowledge. Or maybe the opposite is true—as the character’s
mind slowly slips away, they become oddly compelled or can obsessively
focus on a single task for indefinite periods, and thus they gain
training in that topic or skill. These kinds of changes could be
balanced with inabilities, such as being unable to remember important
details.

As another way to represent madness, the GM could hinder Intellect-based
tasks that would be considered routine, such as “remembering your
friends and family” or “caring what happens to your best friend” or
“stopping yourself from injecting a mysterious substance into your
veins.” These routine tasks normally have a difficulty of 0, but for a
PC who has lost their mind, they might have a difficulty of 1, 2, or
even higher. Now the character must make rolls to do even those simple
things.

ROMANCE RULES MODULE

Like horror, romance doesn’t automatically suggest a setting. It is more
of a mood, or more specifically an approach, to how the game is played.
It suggests an emphasis, at least somewhat, on relationships,
interactions, and connections.

Suggested types and additional equipment for a romance setting are the
same as in a modern setting

CONSENT AND BOUNDARIES

You must get consent to cover these topics in a game ahead of time—you
don’t want to make people uncomfortable. Everyone involved also needs to
learn everyone else’s boundaries. Someone might not want any part of a
romance scene, while others are okay talking about emotional connections
but not anything sexual.

Obviously, all of this is doubly important if age is a consideration. If
there are younger players involved, romance probably shouldn’t go beyond
a fairly chaste kiss. (You’ll find that kids are sometimes more open to
romance in their games than adults, but only because their understanding
of the topic is understandably pretty shallow. A kid player might
declare that a character is their boyfriend, but it doesn’t mean much.
And for some adults, that may be the way they want to approach the
subject as well.)

Lastly, recognize that there needs to be a clear boundary between the
story and real life. Two characters having a relationship has no impact
on real-life feelings of the players. Two characters in a game might be
in a relationship while each player is in a relationship in the real
world with someone else. And maybe they’re gaming at the same table! If
a player can’t distinguish between in-game flirtation or words of
endearment and real-world feelings, they shouldn’t be in a
romance-focused game.

in your game, read the free *Consent in Gaming* PDF at
myMCG.info/consent

THE CHECK-IN

It’s vital that the GM and the players all check in with each other to
make sure everyone’s still comfortable with what’s going on in the game.
This is particularly important to maintain the boundary between emotions
expressed in the story and how people feel in real life.

Basic CREATURES AND NPCs FOR A ROMANCE GAME

Distrustful relative: level 2

Jealous ex: level 2, attacks as level 3

Nosy neighbor: level 2, perception as level 3

Rival suitor: level 2, interactions as level 3

The unattainable: level 3, interactions as level 7, resistance to all
interactions as level 9

OPTIONAL RULE: INFATUATION

When a PC is near someone they are infatuated with, particularly in the
early stages of that infatuation, they must make an Intellect defense
roll with a difficulty determined by the GM based on the situation (not
on the level of the subject of the infatuation). Failure might mean that
the character does or says something awkward or embarrassing either in
an attempt to impress or when trying to hide the infatuation. Or it
could mean that for one round, the player loses control of the
character, and the GM decides what the PC does next, such as risk their
own safety to help an endangered character. However, GMs should welcome
player input into this situation. The point is to portray that when
we’re distracted by the powerful feelings (and hormones) related to
infatuation, we don’t always react in the best way, the smartest way, or
even the way we want to.

Infatuation can happen whether the PC is attracted to an NPC or a PC.

OPTIONAL RULES: RELATIONSHIP LEVELS

When a PC first establishes a relationship with a character (PC or NPC),
the GM should assign the relationship a level. If there’s no connection
at all, there is no relationship (level 0). Otherwise, the starting
relationship is probably level 1. In certain circumstances, a
relationship might start at level 2, indicating a far stronger initial
connection than usual.

As play progresses, the PC can attempt to improve the level of the
relationship, indicating a strengthening of the bond between the two
characters. The requirements to improve the relationship are twofold.
First, some story-based action needs to be taken. This can be dates,
gifts, a meaningful speech, a pledge of commitment, some amount of
self-sacrifice, or whatever the GM and the player feel is appropriate to
the story and the level of the relationship. This action might require
the PC to succeed at specific tasks (with appropriate rolls). For
example, writing a love poem will require an Intellect-based task, while
helping to retrieve a loved one’s cat from a tree might require a
Speed-based task.

Second, the player must make an Intellect-based  
roll with the desired level of relationship as the difficulty (modified
as the GM sees fit).

A relationship can be improved only one level at a time, and the GM and
the player should work out an appropriate time interval. For
relationships of levels 5 and above, multiple story-based actions and
multiple rolls are almost certainly required.

(It’s possible for relationship levels to be lopsided, such that the
relationship from the point of view of one person is a different level
than from the point of view of the other. This should be used sparingly,
because it makes things far more complicated. In the case of polyamory,
it is possible to have more than two people in a relationship, but even
in these situations the connection between any two individuals should
have its own level.)

ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP LEVELS

|       |                                                                     |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Level | Relationship                                                        |
| 1     | First meeting. Interest or curiosity.                               |
| 2     | A sense of connection above the norm. Strong physical attraction.   |
| 3     | Affection and a bond that will last longer than a single encounter. |
| 4     | Serious affection. Almost certainly physical affection.             |
| 5     | A profession of love.                                               |
| 6     | A serious long-term commitment.                                     |
| 7     | A lifelong commitment.                                              |
| 8     | Soul mates.                                                         |
| 9     | A love affair for the ages.                                         |
| 10    | A bond that transcends time and space.                              |

Relationship levels can go down as well as up. Neglect, carelessness,
inappropriate emotional displays, lies, infidelity, and bungled wooing
attempts can all potentially lower a relationship level. This is
entirely in the judgment of the GM, although a lowered relationship
level is very likely an appropriate use of a GM intrusion.

Relationship levels indicate the strength of the bond and thus help
dictate an NPC’s actions in regard to a PC. An NPC in a level 5
relationship probably will be more generous and forgiving toward the PC
than if the relationship was level 3 or 4. An NPC in a level 6
relationship or higher would likely give their partner most anything,
even maybe sacrificing their own well-being or their life for them. (And
people in a higher-level relationship certainly would.) Likewise, a
relationship level can influence a PC’s actions. An Intellect defense
roll with a difficulty equal to the relationship level might be
appropriate if the PC wants to act against the best interests of their
loved one, or if they must keep their cool and act normally when their
loved one is in danger.

You can use this optional system in any genre, for any type of
relationship, even platonic ones. If desired, the relationship level a
PC has with an authority figure, a contact, a relative, or anyone else
can be measured, improved, and decreased just as it can with a romantic
relationship.

PLATONIC RELATIONSHIP LEVELS

|       |                                                                                     |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Level | Relationship                                                                        |
| 1     | First meeting. Interest or curiosity.                                               |
| 2     | A sense of connection above the norm.                                               |
| 3     | A memorable connection. Indications of a mutually beneficial relationship possible. |
| 4     | Real friendship.                                                                    |
| 5     | Deep friendship.                                                                    |
| 6     | Relationship akin to that of a close sibling.                                       |

| 9     | A friendship for the ages.                                                          |

POST-APOCALYPTIC

Post-apocalyptic literature, movies, and games are a subgenre of science
fiction that focuses on the dystopia that follows the fall of
civilization. Strictly speaking, post-apocalyptic stories take place
after the end of the world. At least, the end of the world for most
people. Players take the role of the survivors (or their descendants)
trying to persevere in the face of immense hardship. Popular
post-apocalyptic scenarios include those set after nuclear war, in the
aftermath of a zombie plague, in the months and years following an alien
invasion, or after the environment collapses in the face of human
overpopulation. Other ways the world could end include a massive
meteorite strike, the long-awaited robot uprising, a powerful solar
flare that burns out the world’s power grids and communications, or even
something as prosaic as a global disease pandemic.

SCAVENGING

Characters in a post-apocalyptic setting must usually spend part of each
day scavenging for supplies or a place of safety.

Food and Shelter: Generally speaking, characters must spend two to four
hours searching through the rubble and ruins before succeeding. Finding
enough food for a group of characters to eat for one day is a difficulty
5 Intellect task. Finding a place of relative safety to regroup and rest
is also difficulty 5. Characters who succeed on either one of these also
get to roll up to once each day on the Useful Stuff table and three
times on the Junk table.

Found food often takes the form of canned, processed, dried, or
otherwise preserved goods from before the apocalypse, but sometimes it
includes fresh fruits and vegetables found growing wild or cultivated by
other survivors. Safe places to hole up include homes, RVs, offices,
apartments, or any location that can be secured and defended and isn’t
radioactive, poisoned, or overrun with hostile creatures.

The difficulty of succeeding at finding food, water, and a safe place
varies by location and by how many days the characters have already
spent in one location. Each week the PCs spend at the same location
hinders subsequent scavenging tasks and requires that they succeed on a
new task to determine if the place they’re staying is still safe. The
result of failing to find food and water is obvious. If the PCs fail at
the task of finding (or keeping) a safe place, their presence is noticed
by hostile forces, or they face a result from the Wasteland Threats
table.

Useful Stuff: Food, water, and a safe place to rest are the most
important finds, and are the basis of each scavenging task. But other
obviously useful stuff is often found along with these basic
requirements. When a group of characters successfully finds either food
and water or a safe place, consult the Useful Stuff table up to once per
day. If it’s the first day the PCs have searched in a particular area,
each character might find something useful, but in succeeding days, a
group normally gets only a single roll to find useful stuff.

Useful stuff also includes a “loot” entry. Loot includes collectible
coins from before the apocalypse, such as silver dollars and gold
eagles. It also includes jewelry and artwork that survived the disaster
and related material that can be used as currency or barter when the
characters find other survivors or arrive at a trade town.

Items found on the Useful Stuff table are generally expensive or
exorbitant items (except for firearms, which start in the expensive
category).

Junk: Characters who find food and water also find lots of junk. They
are free to ignore that junk, but some PCs might have a use for what
they find, especially those with the Scavenges focus. All characters
gain up to three results on the Junk table each time they successfully
scavenge for food or a safe place to stay. Sometimes junk can be fixed,
but more often it can be disassembled and used as parts to create
something else.

POST-APOCALYPTIC ARTIFACTS

Artifacts in a post-apocalyptic game include still-working technology
from before the disaster that is not widely available, as well as
cobbled-together pieces of tech that can weaponize previously prosaic
items. If the apocalypse was related to some kind of alien invasion,
artifacts would include even stranger items.

AUTODOC

Level: 1d6

Form: Backpack-sized plastic module from which clamps, forceps,
scalpels, and needles can extend

Effect: When strapped to a target (or when someone wearing the autodoc
is damaged), the autodoc activates and restores 1 point to a target’s
Pools each round for ten rounds or until the target is fully healed,
whichever happens first.

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

ENVIROSCANNER

Level: 1d6

Form: Forearm-mounted computer tablet

Effect: This multifunction device can receive radio transmissions,
automatically map locations the wearer has visited, play various forms
of media, keep voice and written records, and provide an asset to any
task related to interfacing with other computerized systems or machines.
Also, the wearer can scan for specific materials, toxic traces, and life
forms within short range.

Depletion: 1 in 1d10 (check per use of scanning function)

MILITARY EXOSKELETON

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Articulated metal struts with deformable padding and straps for
custom fit to a human frame

Effect: For one hour per use (when the exoskeleton is powered on), the
wearer has +1 to their Speed Edge and +1 to their Might Edge.

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

ROCKET FIST

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Metal gauntlet with flaring rocket exhaust nozzles

Effect: If the user activates the fist as part of an attack, the punch
gains a rocket assist. If the attack is successful, the fist inflicts
additional damage equal to the artifact level and throws the target back
a short distance.

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

ROCKET-PROPELLED GRENADE

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Tube with sight and trigger

Effect: The user can make a long-range attack with a rocket-propelled
grenade that inflicts 7 points of damage to the target and every
creature and object next to the target.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6

TERAHERTZ SCANNER

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Visor fitted with bulky electronics

Effect: By emitting terahertz and long-range infrared light, this device
allows a user to see a short distance through most interior walls of
standard structures, through normal clothing, and into normal bags and
briefcases. Only stone or concrete more than 6 inches (15 cm) thick
prevents a scan. Regardless, images are black and white and fuzzy, and
lack fine detail.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Post-Apocalyptic SPECIES DESCRIPTORS

In a post-apocalyptic setting, some GMs may want to offer species
affected by the disaster.

MORLOCK

You have lived your life deep underground in artificial bunkers, hidden
from the world’s destruction and the brutal scavengers that live above.
As a morlock, you have a keen mind for the technology salvaged from the
before-time. In fact, every morlock comes of age by fitting a piece of
morlock technology to its body to provide enhancement and extend its
life. This means that you are part flesh and part machine. Your skin is
as pale as milk, except where it’s been replaced with strips of metal
and glowing circuits.

You gain the following characteristics:

Enhanced Intelligence: +2 to your Intellect Pool.

Cyborg Body: +2 to your Might Pool and your Speed Pool.

Partially Metallic: +1 to Armor.

Repair and Maintenance: As an entity of living flesh and humming
machinery, you must first succeed on a difficulty 2 repair task before
making a recovery roll. On a failure, the recovery roll is not used;
however, the normal rules for retrying apply, and you must use Effort on
a new roll if you wish to try again. In addition to the normal options
for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to heal additional points
to your Pools (each level of Effort healing an additional 2 points to
your Pools if you succeed).

Morlock Prejudice: While among non-morlocks, all positive interaction
tasks are hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. The PCs found you in a collapsed subterranean tunnel.

2\. The other PCs encountered you exploring underground, and you
convinced them to allow you to accompany them.

3\. You were exiled from the morlock communities and needed help on the
surface.

4\. The only way to save the morlock community you hail from is to
venture to the surface and find a mechanical part needed to repair a
failing ancient system.

ROACH

You are born of a species of evolved insects once called “cockroach,”
but that is far in the past. Radiation and forced evolution have
radically increased your size, shape, and ability to think. Your
exoskeleton mimics the shape of a human being, though not perfectly.
When you move about human society, shadows and cloaks are your ally if
you wish to pass unnoticed. When those of your kind are discovered, it
usually goes poorly for someone. You, however, have a wandering spirit
and seek to explore the fallen world and find a new way forward.

You gain the following characteristics:

Scuttler: Your Speed Edge increases by 1.

Sense by Scent: You can sense your environment even in total darkness.

Cling: You can move an immediate distance each round on walls or
clinging to the ceiling.

Carapace: +1 to Armor.

Glide: You can extend small wings from your carapace that grant an asset
in jumping tasks and allow you to fall up to a short distance without
taking damage.

Skill: You are trained in disguise tasks.

Inability: You are susceptible to disease and poison. Defense rolls
against disease or poison are hindered.

Inability: You mimic a human, but you are not as fierce. Tasks involving
combat— including attack and defense rolls—are hindered.

Insect Prejudice: While among non-roaches, all positive interaction
tasks are hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of
options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. The PCs didn’t realize what you were when they asked for your help.

2\. You’ve managed to hide your roach ancestry so well that everyone
thinks you are like them.

3\. You are the last of your kind.

4\. You have a secret agenda, and the PCs were gullible enough to let
you come along.

Fairy Tale

The genre of fairy tales is a wide one, crossing into almost every
culture and encompassing everything from early oral stories passed down
from generation to generation to the more modern literary fairy tale.
What makes something a fairy tale? While there’s a great deal of
discussion around that question, most have a number of things in common:
a series of  
far-fetched events; fantastical beings such as talking animals, elves,
goblins, mermaids, witches, and dragons; and objects that have magical
elements.

One of the powers of a fairy tale—or a game set in a fairy tale-inspired
setting—is its ability to create a sense of wonder and to evoke players’
imaginations while still allowing them to keep one foot in the known.
The very settings themselves are both enchanted and somehow familiar,
whether the characters are entering a magical woods, falling down a
rabbit hole, or embarking on a voyage to Neverland. Those beasts and
beings who stalk such places are equally wondrous, and offer fantastic
starting points for any number of adventures.

To heighten the sense of wonder in a fairy tale adventure or campaign, a
GM might consider presenting the game in a modern setting. In a modern
setting, characters have regular jobs that don’t normally involve
hunting goblins or helping talking fish solve puzzles. This means that
when the moths take shape and become the cloak of a princess of summer
come to beg a favor or steal a child, or the house grows legs and runs
away one morning, the player characters will be rightfully amazed (and
perhaps somewhat terrified).

NATURE OF FAERIE

Faerie (also called by many other names) is a dimension of magic
separate from but closely parallel to the mundane world. It doesn’t
matter whether Faerie is just a collective term for thousands of
separate curled-up dimensions hidden in corners, in closets, or at the
center of forests, or it’s one continuous realm that overlaps the real
world where it’s thinnest. It’s a place those with open hearts can find
by following a way between tall trees (or looming library shelves) to a
realm where everything is different. Where elves walk, nymphs dance,
unicorns gallop, and both natural growths and built structures become
vast and enchanting.

Humans don’t tend to do well in such a world if they stay too long, as
the sensory input is hard on the nervous system. But fey creatures
depend on it, like plants to the light. A fey creature too long cut off
from its land of origin (or its stream, hill, or burrow) slowly becomes
mortal and then dies.

When a fey creature is cut by silvered or cold iron weapons, they
temporarily lose the sustaining benefit of their connection to Faerie.
This severed connection usually disrupts a fey creature’s ability to
heal. A silvered weapon is one that contains silver as part of an
alloying process, has silver inlay, or has been coated in a dusting of
silver powder (which usually lasts only through a single fight). In
truth, many items in the modern era are cold-forged, while many others
are not. We suggest that any hand-forged item containing iron could be
considered a cold-forged weapon for harming fey creatures. Thus, most
bullets and other modern items wouldn’t be treated as cold iron by this
definition, but some would fit the bill.

Basic CREATURES AND NPCs FOR A FAIRY TALE GAME

Most fey creatures of level 2 or higher regain 1 point of health per
round, unless wounded by silvered or cold iron weapons.

Angry ants: swarm as a level 1 creature; constantly whisper insults,
slurs, and obscenities; those physically attacked must also succeed on a
difficulty 3 Might defense task or be stunned and lose their next turn

Erlking: level 6, stealth as level 7; health 27; Armor 4; short-range
whisper attack enthralls target for one hour or until attacked; root
tendril attacks on up to three separate targets in immediate range;
silvered and cold iron weapons ignore the erlking’s Armor

(*Erlking:* An animated accumulation of woodland debris—bark, lost
teeth, matted weeds, and dirt—that wears a crown of oak leaves and a
cloak of mist.)

Faerie: level 4, deception and Speed defense as level 5; short-range
magic dust attack inflicts damage or makes target amenable to faerie
suggestions for one minute

Feral tree: level 3; Armor 3; rooted in place; lashing branches attack
up to three characters as a single action and on a failed Might defense
task, hold the victim in place until they can escape

Nymph: level 3, stealth and positive social interactions as level 6

Pixie: level 2, stealth and finding lost items as level 6

Razorblade butterflies: level 1; swarm as a level 3 creature able to
attack all creatures in an area an immediate distance across

Talking cat: level 1, knowledge tasks as level 7

Troll: level 6; claws inflict 7 points of damage and grab victim until
they escape; grabbed creature takes 10 points of damage per round; troll
regains 3 points of health per round

FAIRY TALE ARTIFACTS

Artifacts in a fantasy setting and magic items in other games focused on
fantasy would also be suitable for a fairy tale setting. However, every
fairy tale artifact should come with a quirk that sets it apart from a
simple “wand of fire” or similar item. Come up with your own or roll a
quirk on the table below.

|     |                                                                                                                         |

| 1   | Is sometimes invisible.                                                                                                 |
| 2   | Cries like a baby if jostled.                                                                                           |
| 3   | Becomes cold as ice to the touch and emits cold vapor when danger threatens.                                            |
| 4   | Contains a secret compartment that invariably holds a chunk of rock broken from what might be a strange jade sculpture. |
| 5   | Also serves as a key to some magically locked doors and chests.                                                         |
| 6   | Bites owner with tiny teeth if jostled, dealing 1 point of damage.                                                      |
| 7   | Always muttering and complaining, though useful warnings and other information can sometimes be gained.                 |
| 8   | Jealous of any other manifest cyphers, artifacts, or beautiful objects in the wielder’s life.                           |
| 9   | The “painting” of a princess of summer on the object sometimes leaves it, robbing the artifact of power.                |
| 10  | Causes flowers to grow wherever it is stored or set down.                                                               |

Historical

Setting your campaign in World War 2, the Renaissance, or the 1930s can
be fun and interesting. However, setting it in ancient Greece or feudal
Japan, for example, probably makes it more like fantasy without all the
orcs and magic (although a game set in feudal Japan with orcs and magic
could be fascinating).

creating a historical adventure

One of the draws of playing in a historical adventure is the thrill of
“being there” when something important happens. Thus, in many cases,
historical adventures in RPGs shouldn’t be designed as campaigns, but
instead serve as short-term experiences where players try something new,
or at least something they don’t normally do: play as figures involved
in a momentous historical event.

Historical games should take cues from the closely related areas of
historical fiction and historical re-enactment. The lessons of great
historical fiction include the following.

The GM should anchor the characters with problems or conflicts that
connect them to the chosen time period; make sure that PC backgrounds
contain one relevant detail to the chosen historical setting.

The GM shouldn’t fall into the trap of assuming that history was drab
just because it is often presented along with old paintings, drawings,
or blurred black-and-white photographs. Dramatic events, surprising
twists, and unexpected situations are just as likely in a historical
adventure as in any other kind.

What’s the point of a historical adventure if there is no suspense?
Sure, everyone knows what happens at the end of any given historical
battle, but the stories of individuals within those fights are not
known. Will they live? Will they succeed in their mission? And what are
the consequences? Think of all the war movies that rely on that exact
latitude to tell great stories.

Make sure you know when the campaign ends. Maybe it’s when the PCs
successfully accomplish a specific task, but it might be externally
timed to when a historical event takes place, whether they are
attempting to offer aid, thwart it, or merely be aware of it as they
attempt to do something that history hasn’t recorded.

Don’t create more than you need to. Be ready to tell the PCs what they
see and who they encounter when they are introduced to a historical
location or person, but don’t worry about things that they likely will
never see. Yes, figure out what kind of currency is used, but making a
super-accurate list of prices just isn’t necessary; the players will
take your word for the cost of items and many other details. You’re
evoking a historical setting with your game, not writing a book report.

Be wary about stereotypes and cultural misappropriation. History, as
they say, is written by the victors. The ancient Greeks wrote that other
cultures were all barbaric, and the European settlers called the natives
in North America savages, but that doesn’t mean it’s true. If all you
know about a time period is a movie set in that period, you’ll have a
skewed version of events and culture. Be willing to go deeper than
*Braveheart* or *The Last Samurai*, or maybe choose a different genre.

RUNNING A HISTORICAL GAME

Preparation is important in a historical game, and most of that entails
choosing a historical period—or a specific historical event—as the
setting. Given that all of history can serve, you won’t lack for
resources. Below are a few possibilities. Of course, the farther back
you set your game, the less information on specific events is available.
On the other hand, that frees you up to get creative.

Once you choose the historical period and any special events you want to
include in your adventure or campaign, direct your players to an
appropriate set of foci. Alternately, you can have your players play as
historically significant figures, but if you do this, you may want to
create their characters ahead of time. Most GMs will probably want to
save historically significant individuals for use as NPCs.

The players will need some kind of grounding in what to expect in the
time period you’ve chosen. Just like they need an idea of what magic can
do in a fantasy game, they will need a general idea of what kind of
technology is available, the broad strokes of what their characters
might know and not know, and so on. Maybe have them read a Wikipedia
entry, at the very least.

If you’re looking for inspiration for time periods in which to set your
historical game, here are some possible ideas: prehistory, classical
antiquity, ancient Egypt, the American revolution, ancient China, World
War II, Edo Period Japan, Medieval Europe, and the American Old West.

HISTORICAL ARTIFACTS

The concept of artifacts is probably inappropriate for a historical
setting without some kind of supernatural, fantastical, or science
fiction element. That said, objects of mystery such as the Antikythera
mechanism (an ancient analog computer and orrery used to predict
eclipses and other astronomical positions) reveal that the ancient
world—and by extension more recent historical periods—contained
fascinating and useful objects that were anachronistic for their period.
Most such artifacts were likely the creations of philosophers, lone
geniuses, and similar figures.

Creatures

This chapter describes many common and uncommon creatures that the
characters might meet—and fight—in a Cypher System game and gives their
stats. The variety of creatures that populate the possible settings and
genres is so great that this chapter only scratches the surface. It
does, however, provide examples of kinds of inhabitants—bestial and
civilized, living and undead, organic and inorganic—so that you can
easily extrapolate and create your own.

UNDERSTANDING THE LISTINGS

Every creature is presented by name, followed by a standard template
that includes the following categories.

Level: Like the difficulty of a task, each creature and NPC has a level
attached to it. You use the level to determine the target number a PC
must reach to attack or defend against the opponent. In each entry, the
difficulty number for the creature or NPC is listed in parentheses after
its level. As shown on the following table, the target number is three
times the level.

|       |               |
|-------|---------------|
| Level | Target Number |
| 1     | 3             |
| 2     | 6             |
| 3     | 9             |
| 4     | 12            |
| 5     | 15            |
| 6     | 18            |
| 7     | 21            |
| 8     | 24            |
| 9     | 27            |
| 10    | 30            |

Description: Following the name of the creature or NPC is a general
description of its appearance, nature, intelligence, or background.

Motive: This entry is a way to help the GM understand what a creature or
NPC wants. Every creature or person wants something, even if it’s just
to be left alone.

Environment: This entry describes whether the creature tends to be
solitary or travel in groups and what kind of terrain it inhabits (such
as “They travel in packs through dry wastes and temperate lowlands”).

Health: A creature’s target number is usually also its health, which is
the amount of damage it can sustain before it is dead or incapacitated.
For easy reference, the entries always list a creature’s health, even
when it’s the normal amount for a creature of its level.

Damage Inflicted: Generally, when creatures hit in combat, they inflict
their level in damage regardless of the form of attack. Some inflict
more or less or have a special modifier to damage. Intelligent NPCs
often use weapons, but this is more a flavor issue than a mechanical
one. In other words, it doesn’t matter if a level 3 foe uses a sword or
claws—it deals the same damage if it hits. The entries always specify
the amount of damage inflicted, even if it’s the normal amount for a
creature of its level.

Armor: This is the creature’s Armor value. Sometimes the number
represents physical armor, and other times it represents natural
protection. This entry doesn’t appear in the game stats if a creature
has no Armor.

Movement: Movement determines how far the creature can move in a single
turn. Creatures have movements of immediate, short, long, or very long,
which equate to the ranges of the same name. Most PCs have an effective
movement of short, so if they are chasing (or being chased by) a
creature with immediate movement, their Speed tasks are eased; if the
creature’s movement is long or greater, the PCs’ Speed tasks are
hindered.

Modifications: Use these default numbers when a creature’s information
says to use a different target number. For example, a level 4 creature
might say “defends as level 5,” which means PCs attacking it must roll a
target number of 15 (for difficulty 5) instead of 12 (for difficulty 4).
In special circumstances, some creatures have other modifications, but
these are almost always specific to their level.

Combat: This entry gives advice on using the creature in combat, such as
“This creature uses ambushes and hit-and-run tactics.” At the end of the
combat listing, you’ll also find any special abilities, such as
immunities, poisons, and healing skills. GMs should be logical about a
creature’s reaction to a particular action or attack by a PC. For
example, a mechanical creation is immune to normal diseases, a character
can’t poison a being of energy (at least, not with a conventional
poison), and so on.

Interaction: This entry gives advice on using the creature in
interactions, such as “These creatures are willing to talk but respond
poorly to threats,” or “This creature is an animal and acts like an
animal.”

Use: This entry gives the GM suggestions for how to use the creature in
a game session. It might provide general notes or specific adventure
ideas.

Loot: This entry indicates what the PCs might gain if they take items
from their fallen foes (or trade with or trick them). It doesn’t appear
in the game stats if the creature has no loot.

GM Intrusion: This optional entry in the stats suggests a way to use GM
intrusion in an encounter with the creature. It’s just one possible idea
of many, and the GM is encouraged to come up with their own uses of the
game mechanic.

NORMAL ANIMALS

Unlike many creatures in this chapter, normal animals are simple and
understandable enough to be encapsulated by just their level and maybe
one or two other stats.

Bear, black: level 3, attacks as level 4

Bear, grizzly: level 5; health 20; Armor 1

Dog: level 2, perception as level 3

Dog, guard: level 3, attacks and perception as level 4

Hawk: level 2; flies a long distance each round

Horse: level 3; moves a long distance each round

Rat: level 1

Rattlesnake: level 2; bite inflicts 3 points of Speed damage (ignores
Armor)

\* Creature or NPC found in the Cypher System

BIGGER AND TOUGHER

If you need a larger or tougher version of a creature, such as a dire
wolf or a giant crocodile, you can just increase the creature’s level
(and all of its modifications) by 1 or 2. If the creature has a damage
or health stat that isn’t the default for its level, take that into
account at the modified creature’s new level.

A simple rule of thumb is to double a creature’s size (length, width,
and height) for every level it increases.

CREATURES

ABOMINATION 5 (15)

An abomination is a hideous bestial humanoid covered with thickened
plates of scarlet flesh. Their eyes shine with the stagnant glow of
toxic waste dumps. Standing at least 7 feet (2 m) tall, abominations are
drawn to movement. Always famished, they consume living prey in great
tearing bites.

Motive: Hungers for flesh

Environment: Almost anywhere, hunting alone or in pairs

Health: 22

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Armor: 2

Movement: Short

Modifications: Might defense as level 6; sees through deception as level
3

Combat: Abominations use scavenged weapons to attack prey at range, but
probably switch to biting targets within immediate range. Targets
damaged by a bite must also succeed on a Might defense task or descend
one step on the damage track as the abomination tears off a big piece of
flesh and gulps it down. Those who survive an attack must succeed on a
Might defense task a day later when they come down with flu-like
symptoms. Those who fail begin the process of transforming into a fresh
abomination.

Abominations regain 2 points of health per round and have +5 Armor
against damage inflicted by energy (radiation, X-rays, gamma rays, and
so on).

Interaction: Most abominations can speak and have vague memories of the
people they were before transforming. However, those memories,
motivations, and hopes are usually submerged in a hunger that can never
be sated.

Use: Abominations hunt ravaged wastelands and bombed-out spacecraft
hulks, lurk in basements where mad scientists have conducted illicit
experiments, and haunt the dreams of children who’ve gotten in over
their heads.

GM intrusion: The abomination isn’t dead; it stands up on the following
round at full health.

BASILISK 5 (15)

A basilisk is a magical kind of serpent that resembles a cobra, has a
series of scales on its head like a crown, and crawls upright instead of
slithering on its belly. It feeds on snakes and other creatures smaller
than itself, relying on its poisonous aura to weaken and kill its prey.
It is known to make an unnerving growl instead of a typical snake hiss.
An adult basilisk is 10 to 18 feet (3 to 5.5 m) long. 

Motive: Hunger 

Environment: Forests and plains 

Health: 15 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Perception and stealth as level 6 

Combat: A basilisk bites like a snake, inflicting 5 points of damage and
injecting a poison that moves the target one step down the damage track
if they fail a Might defense roll. 

The basilisk can spit its poison up to short range, inflicting 1 point
of damage and moving the target one step down the damage track if they
fail a Might defense roll. 

The basilisk’s venom affects its breath, and on its turn, anything
within immediate range of it must make a Might defense roll or take 1
point of poison damage. Because of this constant invisible cloud of
poison, a basilisk’s lair is surrounded by a stinking area of dead
vegetation, blasted earth, and etched stone. 

Basilisk venom is so potent that even creatures that are immune to
poison can still be harmed by it, taking 5 points of Speed damage
instead of moving down the damage track. (A creature that is immune to
poison and acid is fully immune to the venom.) 

Anyone within short range of a basilisk who meets its gaze and fails a
Might defense roll turns to stone. In combat, when a character within
short distance attacks a basilisk, they must either avert their gaze to
attack safely (which hinders their attack by two steps) or make a Might
defense roll. On a failed Might defense roll, the character takes 5
points of ambient damage as their flesh partly mineralizes; if the
character is killed by this damage, they are turned to stone. 

Interaction: Basilisks act like simple animals and respond threateningly
if disturbed or provoked. If not hungry, a basilisk avoids conflict and
hides in its lair. 

Use: A blighted area in a field, briar, or forest suggests that a
basilisk has moved into the area. Swarms of snakes enter a village,
fleeing an approaching basilisk. 

Loot: Basilisk venom is valuable, but it must be stored in a strong,
sealed container or the bearer will succumb to the poison. Its blood has
alchemical properties relating to transmuting metals.

GM intrusion: Thebasilisk strikes quickly,biting the same creaturetwice
on its turn.

BLACKGUARD 6 (18)

Blackguards are evil knights who serve dark entities or their own
corrupt agendas. Some were once honorable knights who fell to temptation
and have abandoned their original principles, but many were raised under
evil circumstances and have never known anything but hatred and
conflict. 

Motive: Power, domination of others, slaughter 

Environment: Almost anywhere, either alone or as part of a cult or evil
organization 

Health: 30 

Damage Inflicted: 7 points 

Armor: 2 or 3 

Movement: Short; long when mounted 

Modifications: Perception and Intellect defense as level 7 

Combat: Blackguards use high-quality armor and weapons (usually
decorated with symbols depicting death, demons, or evil gods). Many wear
heavy armor and prefer weapons that inflict bleeding wounds, but some
take a more subtle approach and act more like assassins than knights. A
blackguard typically has two or three of the following abilities: 

Fiendish Beast: The blackguard has a companion creature such as a dog,
horse, or raven with an eerie, unnatural look (in the case of small
animals, the creature may also be an exceptionally large specimen of its
kind). The creature is actually a semi-intelligent fiend in animal shape
(and therefore immune to abilities that affect only normal animals) that
can understand the blackguard’s commands, and may even be able to speak.
If the beast is a horse or similar creature, the blackguard might ride
it as a mount. 

Fiendish beast: level 4, stealth as level 5, Might and Intellect defense
as level 5

Necromancy: The blackguard uses a ten-minute ritual to animate a
human-sized corpse as a zombie under their control. The zombie becomes a
corpse again after a day. 

Poison: The blackguard coats their weapons with a level 6 poison; a foe
who fails a Might defense roll moves one step down the damage track. 

Spells: The blackguard knows several spells granted by an evil entity,
typically spells that cause a foe to flee in fear for one minute,
restore 10 health, create an eerie darkness or fog in long range, or
grant +5 Armor against energy and magical attacks for an hour. 

Surprise Attack: When the blackguard attacks from a hidden vantage, with
surprise, or before their opponent has acted in combat, they get an
asset on the attack and inflict +4 points of damage. Unholy 

Aura: Defense rolls by foes within immediate distance of the blackguard
are hindered. 

Unholy Blessing: The blackguard’s defense rolls are eased. 

Interaction: Blackguards enjoy killing righteous paragons of good and
are often cruel for the sake of cruelty itself. 

Use: A blackguard has united various groups of bandits into a small
army. An evil wizard sends her blackguard lieutenant to kill the people
interfering with her plans. 

Loot: Blackguards usually have treasures equivalent to three or four
expensive items, a few useful manifest cyphers, and an artifact weapon
or armor.

GM intrusions:The blackguard’s weaponflares with unholy power,inflicting
an additional6 points of damage(ignores Armor).A slain blackguardrises
as an undead or ispossessed by a demonand continues to figh

CAMBION 5 (15)

Fine ebony scales cover a cambion’s perfectly athletic figure. Two
reddish horns grow from

its brow, and the tips of fangs emerge from between its dusky lips. Its
eyes, absent iris and

pupil, are the color of driven snow. Cambions are cursed creatures, born
of mortal and

demonic parentage, and are also sometimes called helborn. Most cambions
give in to what

everyone expects of them, and embrace evil.

Motive: Defense, conquest, revenge on a world that’s rejected them

Environment: Anywhere, often hiding in plain sight

Health: 25

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short

Modifications: Disguise as level 7

Combat: Cambions sometimes wield heavy weapons in combat, especially if
they come across an artifact that can enhance their attacks. Some
cambions develop their natural and magical abilities to become powerful
sorcerers, but most can call up hellish energy merely by willing it at
least once per day, as follows.

Finger of Torture: A ruby ray lances out from the cambion’s finger to
strike an enemy prone with torturous pain on a failed Might defense
task. The target automatically takes 6 points of damage each round until
they can escape the effect with an Intellect task.

Soulfire Blast: An explosion of soul-rending black and crimson fire
explodes around up to three targets standing next to each other within
short range, inflicting 4 points of damage and stunning the targets so
that they lose their next action on a failed Speed defense task.

Interaction: Cambions are bleak, depressed, and misunderstood. Most have
turned to evil, but a few can be redeemed.

Use: A great fire is seen burning on the horizon. The next day,
travelers come across a burned region with a crater that has destroyed a
farmhouse. At the center of the crater is an unconscious human with
hornlike growths on its head.

Loot: Powerful cambions sometimes wield artifacts as weapons.

GM intrusion: Thecharacter’s cypherexplodes when touchedby cambion
demonfire on a failed Speeddefense task.

CHIMERA 6 (18)

Chimeras are unsettling hybrids that combine the features of many
different animals, often arranged in odd formations. The fusion of
animal forms is the only thing that unifies these creatures—otherwise,
different chimeras often look very different from each other. They
include combinations of goat and lion, lizard and bat, dragon and
spider, dinosaur and giant insect. A few even display human features,
such as an improbably located face or hands instead of claws. Some
chimeras can fly. Others slither across the ground.

A chimera typically has a dominant form to which other animal parts are
grafted. The base form must be large enough to support the weight of the
extra heads, so lions, bears, and horses are popular as the base form.

Chimeras kill even when not hungry and throw their victims’ remains
around a wide area in a wild rage. When not feeding or tormenting prey,
a chimera that can fly takes to the air, beating its enormous leather
wings to scour the landscape for new prey.

Motive: Hungers for human flesh

Environment: Anywhere, usually alone

Health: 21

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Movement: Short while on the ground; long while flying (if it can fly)

Modifications: Speed defense rolls as level 5 due to size

Combat: All chimeras have a number of ways to kill. The exact methods
vary, but most can bite, sting, and gore (three attacks) as a single
action, either attacking the same opponent or attacking different foes
within immediate range of each other. A chimera’s sting carries a
powerful toxin, and a stung target must succeed on a Might defense roll
or take 4 additional points of damage. Chimeras with spikes can project
them at up to three targets within long range as a single action.

Interaction: Chimeras are a lot like wild animals with rabies. They’re
confused and violent, and they behave erratically. Savage, ferocious
beasts, they hate all other creatures and seize any opportunity to kill.

Use: While exploring an island, the PCs find carcasses that have been
torn apart, the pieces scattered in all directions. A chimera lairs
nearby, and if the characters draw attention to themselves, it hunts
them down, too.

GM intrusion: The chimera grabs a character it bites and flies off with
the victim

CHRONOPHAGE 4 (12)

These segmented, 6-foot (2 m) long creatures look partly like larvae
that have grown gargantuan and vicious. They appear in places where time
moves more slowly or more quickly than normal, where balls and liquids
flow upslope, or where a time traveler has visited.

Motive: Hungers for the flesh of those who create, or were created by,
time anomalies

Environment: Clutches of four to eight fade into existence within long
range of space-time fractures in almost any location.

Health: 18

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short; can phase into the dimension of time (and disappear) as
a move. On its next action, it can phase back into the world up to 300
feet (90 m) from where it disappeared (as an action).

Modifications: Perception as level 5

Combat: A chronophage attacks with its crushing mandibles.

A chronophage can phase back and forth between its home dimension, and
it uses this ability to great effect when hunting prey. For instance, it
can close on prey otherwise protected by barriers or features of the
landscape. It can also use the ability to draw a victim’s attention and
then launch a surprise attack from behind after it has effectively
teleported. However, it is an action for the creature to shift its phase
between the dimension of time and normal reality.

Interaction: Chronophages are unswerving in their drive to find prey.
Once one marks its target, only killing the creature can sway it from
the prey.

Use: When the PCs happen upon a location where the rules of space-time
are loose and malleable, or if the PCs trigger a cypher or other device
that interferes with time’s regular flow, a clutch of chronophages may
soon come calling.

Loot: The skin of a chronophage can be salvaged to create a silvery
cloak that reflects its surroundings, but the reflection is one hour
behind the present.

GM intrusion: If a chronophage’s prey fails its Speed defense roll, the
attack ignores Armor, and the prey must make an Intellect defense roll
(difficulty 4) or be phased into the chronophage’s home dimension of
time. Victims automatically phase back into reality on their next turn
but are displaced by 100 feet (30 m) straight up or to the closest open
space. This usually results in a fall that potentially deals 10 points
of damage, knocks victims prone, and dazes them, hindering all actions
for a round.

CORRUPT MAGE 7 (21)

Some wizards and sorcerers are tempted by dark magic, inevitably damning
their souls and corrupting their flesh as they cut corners and delve
into forbidden lore. Their research and experimentation create new kinds
of rampaging monsters and turn people into misshapen horrors. They
sometimes modify their own bodies in order to gain demonic or draconic
powers, or make pacts with such creatures for knowledge and magical
ingredients. 

Motive: Magical knowledge at all costs 

Environment: Almost anywhere, usually with fleshbeast minions 

Fleshbeast: level 4, attacks as level 5; health 15; Armor 1

Health: 35 

Damage Inflicted: 7 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: All tasks related to knowledge of arcane lore, demons,
and altering bodies as level 8 

Combat: Corrupt mages blast opponents with beams of energy that blister,
slash, and rot flesh, attacking up to three creatures as an action. Many
of them have given themselves long claws and teeth that they can use to
make up to three melee attacks per action. 

A corrupt mage knows many spells, such as the following:

 • Armor: Covers a creature with ugly scales, granting them +3 to Armor
for an hour. 

• Madness: Wracks the brain of one creature within short range for one
hour, reducing them to a babbling catatonic state in which they can’t
recognize friend or foe. If disturbed or harmed, the creature is likely
to lash out with lethal force at what it perceives as its tormentors. 

• Organ Request: Extracts a handful of internal organs from an opponent
within short range, moving the creature one step down the damage track
if it fails a Might defense roll. 

• Polymorph: Transforms one foe within short range into a tiny, helpless
creature such as a cockroach, fish, or snail for one hour. 

• Summon Demon: Summons a demon to serve the mage for one hour. 

• Teleport: Moves the mage up to 100 miles (160 km) away, or less far if
they bring additional creatures with them. 

• Twist Flesh: Reshapes the flesh of a creature within close range,
turning it into a hideous monstrosity for one hour. The transformed
creature’s actions are hindered, but its physical attacks inflict +3
points of damage. The mage’s control over the creature is limited to
indicating which target it should attack. 

A corrupt mage usually has several cyphers useful in combat and perhaps
an artifact as well. 

Interaction: Corrupt mages generally can’t be trusted and see other
creatures as things to experiment on and vivisect. They might negotiate
with someone who brings them a rare specimen or spell. Many are mentally
disturbed by their research and self-alterations and may fluctuate
between calm clarity, obsession, paranoia, and rage. 

Use: The strange hybrid monsters emerging from the forest are said to be
the creations of a corrupt mage. A corrupt mage in a calm state presents
themselves as a neutral or benevolent wizard seeking assistance on a
task. 

Loot: A corrupt mage has 1d6 cyphers and perhaps a wizardly artifact.

GM intrusions:A desperate or dyingcorrupt mage transformstheir own body
intoseveral new fleshbeasts,which retain fragmentsof the mage’s
intelligenceand immediately attack.The mage’s attack spellis incredibly
painful,stunning the characterfor one round if they faila Might defense
roll.

CYCLOPS 7 (21)

Cyclopes resemble massive humans that stand 50 to 60 feet (15 to 18 m)
tall and weigh about 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg). Everything about these
giants is exaggerated, from the thick features of their faces to their
oversized hands and lumpy, corpulent bodies. They clothe themselves in
animal skins, scraps of cloth, or canvas stolen during their travels. A
cyclops’s most distinctive feature is the single eye positioned in the
center of its forehead. Cyclopes live on the edges of civilized areas or
on remote islands. For all their power and stature, they aren’t
especially brave, and most have a dim idea that puny humans have an
advantage when they have numbers on their side.

Motive: Hungers for flesh 

Environment: Almost anywhere 

Health: 32

Damage Inflicted: 8 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Attacks targets within immediate range as level 5 due to
poor eyesight; Speed defense as level 5 due to size; Intellect defense
as level 4 

Combat: A cyclops can always resort to using its fists in melee,
pummeling opponents with knuckles the size of large hogs. However, most
cyclopes carry a tree trunk and use it to sweep enemies from their path.
Due to its massive height, a cyclops can make a melee attack against
creatures within short range. 

Cyclopes can pry up boulders from the ground and throw them at targets
within long range. A thrown boulder inflicts 8 points of damage to all
targets in an immediate area. 

Killing a cyclops can be dangerous. When killed, it falls away from the
attacker that delivered the killing blow. Any creature under it when it
falls must make a successful Speed defense roll or be pinned under its
corpse and take 7 points of damage. Escaping from under a dead cyclops
requires a successful Might roll. 

Interaction: Cyclopes know the language of the lands they inhabit, but
they are notoriously dim and easily fooled. A cyclops thinks about its
belly first and foremost and doesn’t pay much attention to what it
stuffs in its mouth. 

Use: A cyclops has been rampaging across the countryside, and warriors
sent to deal with it have been vanquished. PCs who investigate learn
that the cyclops has been robbed and is trying to find the stolen item. 

Loot: Most cyclopes carry sacks filled with things they find interesting
or plan to eat. Aside from the rubbish, a typical sack contains 1d100
coins of the realm and a couple of cyphers.

GM intrusions: The cyclops hits acharacter so hard thatthey fly a short
distanceaway and land prone.

A character struckby the cyclops’s fist isgrabbed and stuffed inthe
creature’s sack.

DEEP ONE 4 (12)

Some deep ones dwell in coastal regions on land, usually in isolated
villages where they might attempt to pass for human. They are able to
breathe both air and water. Most, however, thrive in the ocean depths,
in ancient underwater cities like “Cyclopean and many-columned
Y’ha-nthlei.” Deep ones sometimes breed with insane humans to produce
squamous offspring that eventually develop fully into deep ones well
after maturity (or even middle age).

Motive: Hungers for flesh

Environment: Anywhere near a large body of salt water

Health: 15

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Armor: 2

Movement: Short on land; long in the water

Modifications: Swims as level 6; perception as level 3

Combat: Deep ones attack with tooth and claw most often, although
occasionally one might use a weapon. They usually give no quarter, nor
ask for it. Their skin is subject to drying, and they take 1 extra point
of damage (ignores Armor) from any attack that deals fire or heat
damage. Because of this weakness, deep ones sometimes retreat from fire
and fire attacks.

Interaction: Deep ones are a strange mix of utter alienness and the
vestiges of lost humanity. They are foul and degenerate creatures by
human standards, however. Many still retain the ability to speak human
languages, but all speak their own slurred, unearthly tongue.

Deep ones spend a great deal of time in the sincere adoration of their
gods, Mother Hydra, Father Dagon, and Cthulhu. Their religion demands
frequent blood sacrifices.

Use: The PCs wander into a small coastal village where everyone seems
standoffish and oddly distant. A few people appear to be sickly and
malformed, perhaps from mutation or birth defects. Some of the villagers
have squamous skin because they are transforming into deep ones. And, of
course, true deep ones hide within the community as well.

Loot: A few deep ones will have a cypher.

*GM intrusion:* The deep one produces a net and throws it over the
character. The only physical action the victim can take is to try to get
free, as either a Might-based or a Speed-based action.

DEINONYCHUS 3 (9)

Popularly known as the velociraptor, the dinosaur genus called
deinonychus doesn’t care if its prey gets the proper terminology sorted.
Meat tastes like meat. The “terrible claw” these carnivores are named
after refers to their massive, sickle-shaped claws, which are unsheathed
from their hind legs when attacking prey.

Deinonychus are pack hunters, which means they work together as a unit,
each taking on different roles to scare, flush, and direct even
intelligent prey into the claws of an ambush.

Motive: Hungers for flesh

Environment: Wherever they can hunt food, in packs of three to seven

Health: 15

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short

Modifications: Perception as level 5; attacks and Speed defense as level
4 due to quickness; overcoming obstacles and figuring out tricks as
level 4

Combat: When a deinonychus bites its prey, the victim takes damage and
must make a Might defense roll. On a failure, the deinonychus holds the
victim in place with its jaws while it slices them to ribbons with its
terrible claws, automatically inflicting 6 points of damage each round
in which they fail a Might-based task to break free (not attempting to
break free counts as a failed attempt). For a human-sized or smaller
victim held in the jaws, all other tasks are hindered by two steps.

Interaction: Vicious, cunning, and a little too smart to be classified
as simple predators, these creatures are unlikely to negotiate, give
quarter, or back off from a fight even if contact could be made.

Use: Some fool decided to build a Cretaceous-themed zoo. The only
question is: How long before the dinosaurs get loose and take over the
local mall?

GM intrusion: The fleeing deinonychus was actually leading the character
over a cliff, into a deadfall trap, or into an ambush with more
deinonychus.

DEMIGOD 9 (27)

Lesser gods, divine children of gods and mortals, and other beings
bequeathed with partly divine power are called demigods. Their
capacities so radically exceed those of regular people that they have
transcended humanity. Demigods are so physically and mentally powerful
that it’s difficult for them to hide their semi-divine appearance to
mortal creatures—not that most would make the effort in the first place.

Motive: Ineffable

Environment: Anywhere other divine entities exist (or once existed)

Health: 99

Damage Inflicted: 12 points

Armor: 5

Movement: Short; long when flying

Combat: Demigods can attack foes up to half a mile (1 km) away with
bolts of divine energy (usually in the form of lightning). A demigod can
dial up the level of destruction if it wishes, so that instead of
affecting only one target, a bolt deals 9 points of damage to all
targets within short range of the primary target. Targets caught in the
conflagration who succeed on a Speed defense roll still suffer 5 points
of damage.

Demigods are just as scary in hand-to-hand combat and can attack all
targets within immediate range as an action. They can also call on a
variety of other abilities that seem like magic to lesser foes and mimic
the effect of any cypher of level 5 or lower.

A demigod doesn’t need to alter reality to heal itself, as it
automatically regains 2 points of health per round.

Interaction: For all their power, demigods share most human traits and
weaknesses. This means it’s possible to negotiate with one, though the
consequences for angering a demigod in the process are dire.

Use: A demigod was banned from the higher realm of their birth for
unknown reasons. Now they seek to show their worth by undertaking a
great quest in the mortal world, and they are looking to assemble a
group of mortal comrades (sycophants?) to aid them.

Loot: Demigods might carry an artifact related to some aspect of their
domain (such as wind, messages, or death), if they have one, and 1d6
cyphers.

GM intrusion: The divine nature of the demigod allows it to act out of
turn, take control of an object (such as an artifact or a cypher) that
the PC is about to use against it, and either deactivate the object or
turn it against the character.

DEMON 5 (15)

Demons are formless spirits of the dead tortured in nether realms until
all that was good or caring in them was burned away, forging a being of
spite and hate.

A demon remembers only fragments of its former life—every good memory is
cauterized, and every slight, misfortune, snub, and pain is amplified,
motivating the creature to tempt others into the same state.

Having no flesh to call its own, a demon is a shadowed, ephemeral horror
able to possess others. A demon can cause great harm in a short time by
forcing its host to lie, steal, and harm loved ones.

Motive: Hungers for others’ pain and fear

Environment: Anywhere

Health: 25

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Movement: Short; immediate while flying in immaterial form

Modifications: All stealth tasks as level 7 in immaterial form;
deception tasks as level 6

Combat: The immaterial touch of a demon either inflicts 5 points of
damage from rot, or allows the demon to attempt to possess the target.
The target of an attempted possession must make an Intellect defense
roll or become possessed, whereupon the demon’s immaterial form
disappears into the target.

The first round in which a character is possessed, they can act
normally. In the second and all subsequent rounds, the possessing demon
can control the actions of the host, but the  
character can attempt an Intellect defense roll to resist each suggested
action. Successful resistance means that the character does nothing for
one round. In other rounds, the character can act as they choose. A
possessing demon’s actions are limited to attempts to control its host
and leaving the host.

A possessed target is allowed an Intellect defense roll to eject the
demon once per day, barring any exorcism attempts. The defense roll is
hindered by one additional step each day of possession after the first
seven days. An ejected or cast-out demon is powerless for one or more
days.

A demon not possessing another creature is immaterial and can pass
through solid objects whose level is lower than its own. While the demon
is immaterial, it takes only 1 point of damage from mundane attacks, but
it takes full damage from magical, energy, and psychic attacks. While it
possesses another creature, the demon is immune to most attacks (though
not so the host; killing the host will eject the demon).

Interaction: A demon allows a possessed host to act normally, as long as
it doesn’t reveal the demon’s presence. If its presence is known, the
demon might negotiate, but only after a tirade of lies and obscenity,
and the demon likely betrays any deal reached.

Use: An ally of the PCs has begun acting differently, and not for the
good.

GM intrusion: The character who attempts an exorcism of a possessed
target is successful, but the demon moves directly from the former
victim into the exorcist. The new host can make an Intellect-based roll
to eject the demon, but only after the first round of possession.

DEMON LORD 9 (27)

Demon lords are mighty demons, commanding hundreds of lesser fiends and
often ruling an entire hellscape dimension. No mere brutes, they are
smart, wield powerful magic, make centuries-long plans of conquest
against rival demons, and seek to corrupt and enslave powerful mortals.
Some are nearly as powerful as gods and are worshipped as such by
cultists or evil creatures, claiming ownership of a concept like murder,
rot, undeath, or seduction. A few are known to mate with mortals to
produce cambion offspring. 

Motive: Power, conquest, souls 

Environment: Any hell dimension, sometimes called by mortal magic 

Health: 100

Damage Inflicted: 12 points 

Armor: 5 

Movement: Short; long when flying 

Modifications: History and magical knowledge as level 10

Combat: A demon lord attacks with a bolt of evil energy or fire up to a
long distance away, inflicting 12 points of damage on one target or 9
points of damage on all targets within short range of the primary
target. Targets caught in the area attack who succeed on a Speed defense
roll still suffer 5 points of damage. A demon lord can make melee
attacks on all targets within immediate range as an action. 

They can also call on a variety of other magical abilities that mimic
the effect of any cypher of level 5 or lower—usually destructive,
painful, and transformative effects.

 A demon lord automatically regains 3 points of health per round. They
typically have the following abilities: 

• Change Shape: The demon lord can take the form of a human or similar
humanoid as its action, or return to its regular shape. When so changed,
its disguise is nearly impenetrable without special knowledge. As a
human, the demon lord is a level 7 creature. 

• Possession: The demon lord can possess a creature and still use its
own abilities. 

• Summon Demon: Summon a demon or devil to serve it for one day. 

• Wish: The demon lord can grant a mortal a wish (up to level 9) in
exchange for an appropriate payment or service, but the wish is often
twisted or has hidden consequences. 

Interaction: Demon lords are willing to bargain with mortals if it leads
to the mortal’s corruption or advances the demon’s agenda in some way.
They sometimes respond to flattery or bribes of powerful souls or magic
items. 

Use: A mad cult wants to summon a demon lord in order to end the world.
A mysterious stranger offers aid in exchange for a favor to be named
later. 

Loot: A demon lord often has an artifact relating to some aspect of its
nature or interests, such as a weapon, ring, or armor, as well as 1d6
cyphers.

GM intrusions:The demon lord offersthe character somethingso tempting
(an artifact,immortality, and soon) that they lose theirnext action and
mustmake an Intellectdefense roll to resisttrying to bargain for it.

The demon lord createsa portal and retreatsto its own dimension;the
portal remainsopen for one round

DEVIL 4 (12)

Devils are manifest evil. As “native fauna” of various tortuous nether
realms, devils come in many forms, though most are iterations on a theme
that includes a humanoid shape, large batwings, bestial faces, and
twisting horns. Most stink of brimstone and sport tails that end in a
fork. Devils fill the ranks of hellish armies, guard evil vaults, and
appear at the magical summons of warlocks and sorcerers who are not
afraid for the sanctity of their own souls.

Motive: Collect souls

Environment: Anywhere in various nether realms; sometimes called by
mortal magic

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Armor: 3

Movement: Short when walking or flying

Modifications: All tasks related to deception as level 7

Combat: When possible, a devil attacks with surprise. If successful, it
unfurls two great wings and claws at the ends of its fingers. It leaps
into the air, flies up to a short distance toward the nearest foe, and
attacks that creature as a single action.

Some devils carry tridents. The weapon inflicts 5 points of damage, and
the target must either move to a position within an immediate distance
chosen by the devil or take 2 additional points of damage from being
impaled (a total of 7 points of damage). Impaled foes automatically take
5 points of damage each round until they use an action to pull  
themselves free.

Interaction: Evil, cruel, and malevolent, devils are more than happy to
talk, especially to those already caught and being readied for torture.
Devils serve yet more powerful devils out of fear. If they find someone
or something they fear more, they readily betray their master and become
obsequious and cringing, though further betrayal is always on the table.

Use: A spate of violent murders grips a city in fear—a devil has escaped
into the world of mortals without a leash. It spends nights hunting
anyone it spots from its perches atop the city’s holy places.

GM intrusion: A devil anticipates the character’s melee attack and
brings its wing down “just so” on the attacker’s weapon. If the
character fails a Speed defense roll, the weapon breaks. Either way, the
attack fails to hit the devil.

DJINNI 7 (21)

Djinn inhabit unseen dimensions beyond the visible universe. Just like
normal creatures, djinn are individuals, and they can be good, evil, or
unconcerned about the fates and doings of others.

Motive: Unpredictable

Environment: Almost anywhere

Health: 35

Damage Inflicted: 9 points

Movement: Short; long when flying

Modifications: Knowledge of Arabian history as level 8

Combat: With a touch, a djinni can warp a victim’s flesh, inflicting
damage. Djinn can also use an action to send out a magitech “EMP burst”
that renders all artifacts, machines, and lesser magic devices within
short range inoperable for one minute. (If the item is part of a
character’s equipment, they can prevent this outcome by succeeding on a
Speed defense roll.) Instead of disabling all devices in range, a djinni
can instead take control of one item within range for one minute, if
applicable.

A djinni can transform into a being of smoke and flame as its action.
While in this form, it has +10 to Armor but can’t attack foes. It gains
the ability to fly a long distance each round and retains the ability to
communicate normally. The first time each day that a djinni returns to
physical form after having become smoke, it regains 25 points of health.

Some djinn have the ability to grant wishes, and a few are beholden to
do so thanks to an ancient, unexplained agreement with other djinn.
Those who grant wishes twist them against the asker, especially if a
wish is poorly worded or there are multiple ways to interpret it. The
level of the effect granted is no greater than level 7, as determined by
the GM, who can modify the effect of the wish accordingly. (The larger
the wish, the more likely the GM will limit its effect.)

Interaction: When a djinni interacts with characters, it’s narcissistic,
certain in its own immense power, and unlikely to let slights pass. That
said, low-tier characters could negotiate with one peacefully because
even djinn have needs and desires.

Use: Agents of a foreign power retrieved a magic lamp from an ancient
Arabian ruin. The PCs’ job is to determine whether there is reason for
alarm.

Loot: Most djinn carry a couple of cyphers, and some have a magic
artifact useful in combat.

GM intrusion: When the character is touched by a djinni, instead of
taking damage, the character is turned to smoke and fire and sent
whirling off in a random direction. They lose their next turn and return
to normal almost 300 feet (90 m) from where they started.

DRAGON 7 (21)

Dragons are exceptionally territorial, vain, and greedy. Apex predators,
dragons must eat large meals on a regular basis. They prefer virgins,
though they will settle for whoever, or whatever—such as horses or wild
pigs—is available in a pinch. They love games of all sorts, especially
when they get to consume the loser. Drawn to wealth and magic, dragons
accumulate hoards of golden treasure. A dragon’s hoard is not only an
end in itself, but part of a never-ending contest between dragons of a
certain age to see which one can accumulate the largest trove.

Motive: Self-aggrandizement, hungers for flesh, treasure collection

Environment: Dragons thrive where wilderness meets the civilized
frontier.

Health: 45

Damage Inflicted: 10 points

Armor: 3

Movement: Short; long while flying

Modifications: Perception and riddles as level 8; Speed defense as level
6 due to size

Combat: A dragon can bite one target or claw two opponents in immediate
range as a single action. When bitten, targets are also immobilized
until they succeed on a Might defense roll to break free (or the dragon
drops them).

Most dragons have one or more additional magical abilities they can
bring to bear in combat, including the following.

*Captivate:* A dragon with this ability can psychically mesmerize a
nondragon target in immediate range who fails an Intellect defense roll.
A captivated target does the dragon’s verbal bidding for one or more
hours. Each time the target is confronted by a third party about its
mental condition, the target is allowed another Intellect defense roll
to break the effect.

*Change Shape:* A dragon with this ability can take the form of a human
or similar humanoid as its action, or return to its regular shape. When
so changed, the dragon’s disguise is nearly impenetrable without special
knowledge. As a human, the dragon is a level 5 creature.

*Fiery Breath:* A dragon can breathe a stream of fire up to long range,
doing 7 points of damage to all targets within immediate range of each
other. Targets who succeed on a Speed defense roll to avoid the full
effect of the fire still take 3 points of damage. This ability cannot be
used in consecutive rounds.

Interaction: Like the many hues of dragon scales, dragon personalities
run the gamut from beastly thug to refined connoisseur. Some dragons lie
with every smoky breath, others consider the least bit of dishonesty a
personal failing, and most fall somewhere in between. All of them can be
flattered and even charmed by someone with courtly manners and grace.

Use: A dragon confronts the PCs, challenging them to a riddle game. If
the characters win, they get a cypher. If the dragon wins, the PCs owe
it a favor to be specified later<span dir="rtl"> . . . </span>unless the
dragon is hungry now.

Loot: A dragon’s hoard might contain 2d6 cyphers, hard currency
equivalent to 1d6 exorbitant items, and possibly a few artifacts (but a
hoard is usually well guarded).

GM intrusion: The dragon breathes fire while the character is caught in
its mouth, which automatically inflicts maximum fire damage on them.

Fire ELEMENTAL 4 (12)

Searing flame in a vaguely humanoid shape, a fire elemental exists only
to burn that which is not already ash. They sometimes spin into being
where great conflagrations burn.

Motive: Burn

Environment: Anywhere fires can burn

Health: 24

Damage Inflicted: 4 to 7 points; see Combat

Movement: Short

Modifications: See Combat for escalating attack level modification.

Combat: A fire elemental attacks with a flaming limb. The more the
elemental burns foes, the more powerful it grows. Its power increases
according to the number of successful attacks (that dealt fire damage)
it made on another creature during the previous minute.

*0 successful attacks:* deals 4 points of damage; attacks as level 4

*1 successful attack:* deals 5 points of damage; attacks as level 5

*3 successful attacks:* deals 6 points of damage; attacks as level 6

*4+ successful attacks:* deals 7 points of damage; attacks as level 7

If a fire elemental hasn’t burned a foe within the last minute, its
combat stats drop back to its level 4 baseline.

A fire elemental is immune to fire attacks but vulnerable to cold; every
time it takes 1 point of cold damage, it takes 1 additional point of
damage.

Interaction: Fire elementals are barely sapient and usually respond only
to those who know spells able to command them. However, there’s a chance
(about 10%) that a fire elemental commanded to accomplish a particular
task breaks free and instead burns whatever’s around until it exhausts
all possible fuel sources.

Use: A rash of fires leads some people to suspect that an arsonist is on
the loose, but the truth is worse.

GM intrusion: A character hit by the fire elemental’s attack catches on
fire and takes 3 points of damage each round until they use an action
patting, rolling, or smothering the flames.

EARTH ELEMENTAL 5 (15)

An excavation, a meteor fall, a still-shuddering earthquake—all these
events can summon an earth elemental to take shape and expand the
destruction further.

Motive: Crumble and break, reduce things to earth

Environment: Anywhere solid or earthen

Health: 30

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Armor: 3

Movement: Immediate; short when burrowing

Combat: Earth elementals batter foes with heavy fists. They can also
create earthquakes (no more than once every other round) that affect the
ground within short range. Creatures standing in the area fall to the
ground and take 5 points of damage on a failed Might defense roll.

An earth elemental is vulnerable to water. Any damage it takes while
standing in or being doused in water ignores its Armor.

Interaction: Although brooding and slow to respond if encountered as
immobile stone, earth elementals are intelligent. The ones that are
summoned with a spell have about a 5% chance of breaking the geas and
turning on their summoner.

Use: Oddly articulated monoliths were discovered high in the mountains
around a shrine containing an ancient treasure. A merchant wants someone
to investigate the monoliths in case they represent a trap. In fact, the
monoliths are inactive earth elementals.

GM intrusion: A character within range of the earth elemental’s
earthquake attack must succeed on a Speed defense roll or be covered in
an avalanche from a collapsing structure or cliff face.

ELEMENTAL, AIR 4 (12)

Air elementals are capricious pieces of air with simple minds. They
spontaneously appear in clouds and high mountains, and often resemble an
area of mist or a cloudlike humanoid shape. 

Motive: Mischief and destruction 

Environment: Anywhere the wind blows 

Health: 24 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Movement: Long when flying 

Modifications: Stealth as level 6  
Combat: Air elementals slice foes up to a short distance away with
blades of fierce wind, or use blasts of air to throw small objects. Once
every other round, an air elemental can turn into a tornado-like vortex
that inflicts 4 points of damage to all creatures within immediate
range. In this form, the elemental gains +1 to Armor and an additional
+2 to Armor against physical projectile weapons such as arrows and
javelins. The elemental reverts to its normal form at the start of its
next turn. 

An air elemental can disperse itself over a short area as an action. In
this form it is invisible, unable to attack, and can’t be attacked
except with area attacks. The elemental can remain in this form
indefinitely, but must use an action to return to its normal form. 

Air elementals are elusive opponents and hard to destroy. If an air
elemental is reduced to 0 health, there is a 50 percent chance that it
rejuvenates a few rounds later with 6 health. The elemental then
continues to fight or flees to cause trouble elsewhere. 

Interaction: Air elementals see and hear many things, but they are
flighty and what they remember usually isn’t important or relevant. They
can be summoned with magic but don’t like being controlled, and there is
a 10 percent chance that they free themselves and strike out on their
own. 

Use: A safe mountain trail has become hazardous due to unseasonal winds
that threaten to push travelers off a cliff. An old tree is surrounded
by whispers of conversations that took place recently and has started
hurling sticks and fruit at anyone who comes too close.

GM intrusion: Aviolent blast of winddisarms a characterand sends
whateverthey were holding up toa long distance away(depending on
theobject’s size and weight).

ELEMENTAL, THORN 6 (18)

The grisly sign of an active thorn elemental in areas of heavy woods or
jungle is the presence of shriveled bodies dangling from vines, dead of
strangulation and poison. Thorn elementals take form in areas dense with
woody growth under threat by hatchet, axe, saw, and, sometimes,
human-caused climate disruptions. 

Motive: Defense of forests 

Environment: Anywhere trees grow 

Health: 36 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Armor: 2 

Movement: Immediate 

Combat: Thorn elementals batter foes with thorny, vine-wrapped fists.
Targets who suffer damage must make a successful Might defense roll or
take 2 points of Speed damage from a paralytic poison transmitted by a
thorn’s prick. Worse, the poison continues to inflict 2 points of Speed
damage each round until the victim succeeds at a Might defense roll. 

As its action, a thorn elemental can disentangle its form and reassemble
a new body anywhere within long range where trees and plants grow. A
thorn elemental regains 2 points of health each time it travels in this
fashion. 

Interaction: Thorn elementals communicate through speech, though they
generally disdain talking to creatures of the animal kingdom. Thorn
elementals exist within a hierarchy; those that have a greater capacity
for communication are also usually more powerful. Summoned thorn
elementals have about a 5 percent chance of breaking the geas and
turning on their summoner. 

Use: Adventuring characters journey through a forest that is under
threat of destruction by an encroachment of other humanoids. Thinking
the PCs are part of the encroachers, a thorn elemental attacks them. If
communication is opened, it might break off hostilities and instead ask
the characters to help. 

Loot: The bodies of those previously defeated by thorn elementals dangle
from the forest or jungle canopy with all their former possessions. One
or two might have a cypher and other tools and treasure.

Woody vine: level 4; Armor 1

GM intrusion: A character within short range of a thorn elemental must
make a successful Speed defense roll or be hauled into the air by a vine
noose around their neck. They can try to cut thew oody vine or attempt a
Might task to break free before they strangle. Each round after thefirst
in which they fail to break the noose, they move down one step on the
damage track.

ELEMENTAL, WATER 4 (12)

Water elementals are animate masses of water. When swimming, they are
nearly indistinguishable from their surroundings, but when they have to
move on dry land, they usually take the form of a curling wave,
amorphous blob, or large puddle. They can spontaneously appear in
locations with pristine salt or fresh water. 

Motive: Flood, drown, and wash away 

Environment: Anywhere there is flowing water 

Health: 24 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Movement: Short; long if swimming 

Modifications: Swimming and aquatic maneuvers as level 6; stealth as
level 6 when in water 

Combat: Water elementals bash opponents with heavy limbs of water or
spray jets of water out to short range. 

Instead of a bashing attack, a water elemental can use its action to
attempt to envelop, smother, and crush one opponent, who can resist with
a Might defense roll. If the opponent fails, it takes 4 points of damage
immediately and every round on the elemental’s turn. Each following
turn, the enveloped character must attempt a new Might defense roll
every round or move one step down the damage track from drowning as the
elemental forces itself into the creature’s lungs. The creature can free
itself with a Might defense roll. An elemental with an enveloped
opponent can move up to a short distance as its action; a common tactic
is to dive deep, release their opponent to drown normally, then return
to its previous position to fight other opponents. 

Any attack that inflicts 6 or more points of cold damage hinders a water
elemental’s actions on its next turn.

Interaction: Water elementals are somewhat intelligent but think very
differently from humans, so they often seem distracted and dull. They
are generally compliant when summoned with magic, but there is about a 5
percent chance that they break free of the spell and lash out against
their summoner. 

Use: Offerings left at a sacred pond have gone missing, and the water
itself seems threatening. Garbage or dead bodies have polluted a water
source, spawning an angry elemental that attacks everyone until the mess
is cleaned up.

GM intrusion: The forceof the elemental’s attackknocks over a
character,sweeps them a shortdistance away, or both.

ENTHRALLER 6 (18)

Hundreds of thousands of years ago, enthraller ancestors psychically
dominated a group of interstellar spacefarers who had the misfortune to
land on the enthraller homeworld. Leapfrogging technological prowess by
mentally commandeering the know-how of every new species they
encountered using their stolen space vessel, the aliens fashioned the
Enthraller Dominion, which stretches across vast swaths of space,
cemented by the psychic control.

Individual enthrallers are scary, but enthraller overlords are even more
powerful thanks to technological aids. These include cranial circlets
that give a single enthraller governor the ability to dominate a small
city, solar-system-sized ring relays that boost their control across
interstellar distances, and more.

Recently, a newly contacted species of aliens developed the
technological means to resist the mental influence of the enthrallers.
Now war bubbles across the Enthraller Dominion. Sometimes individual
enthrallers, stripped of their technological enhancements as a
consequence of this war, flee into virgin space, looking for new
soldiers to dominate.

Motive: Domination of other creatures

Environment: Almost anywhere, alone or in groups of three

Health: 18

Damage Inflicted: 4 points; see Combat

Armor: 1

Movement: Short

Modifications: Speed defense as level 4; perception and ability to
detect falsehoods as level 8

Combat: An enthraller usually relies on dominated minions to make
physical attacks on its behalf. An enthraller can  
make a psychic attack on a creature within short range. On a failed
Intellect defense roll, the target acts as the enthraller mentally
commands on its next action. If the same target is affected by this
dominating attack a second time within a minute, the enthraller’s mental
control lasts for one minute.

Alternatively, as its action, an enthraller can emit a psychic burst
that can target up to three creatures in short range. On a failed
Intellect defense roll, a victim suffers 4 points of Intellect damage
(ignores Armor) and is unable to  
take actions on their subsequent turn. If the victim is attacked while
so stunned, their defense rolls are hindered by two steps.

The enthraller’s attack is a form of mental feeding. If it moves a PC
down the damage track, the creature regains 4 points of health.

Interaction: An enthraller can communicate telepathically with
characters within short range. It tries to mentally dominate whoever it
runs across and will negotiate only with characters who are strong
enough to harm it. Even if an enthraller makes a deal, it eventually
reneges if it senses any advantage for doing so because it implicitly
believes that other creatures are cattle.

Use: A spacecraft (or perhaps an escape pod) crash lands. Inside, a hurt
enthraller lies in suspended animation. Investigators are unlikely to
realize the enthraller’s nature beforehand, but they certainly learn if
they wake the alien.

Loot: Enthrallers wear light armor suited for their forms. They might
have one or two cyphers and, rarely, an artifact that boosts their
already-fearsome mental capabilities.

GM intrusion: The enthraller’s intrusion into the character’s mind stirs
up forgotten memories. The character must deal with the contents of
these memories and perhaps why they were repressed.

EVIL PRIEST 7 (21)

Evil priests are worshippers of evil gods, demons, devils, strange
malevolent forces from beyond known dimensions, or even death itself.
They lead cults, corrupt the innocent with lies and twisted ideologies,
and enact the will of their patron in the mortal world. The most
insidious ones are able to infiltrate good churches and secular
organizations in order to tear them down from the inside. 

Motive: Domination of others, divine rule 

Environment: Almost anywhere that people live 

Health: 28 

Damage Inflicted: 7 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Deception, persuasion, and religious lore as level 8 

Combat: Evil priests make one or two short-range magical attacks as an
action, which are thematically appropriate to the god or entity they
serve, such as blasts of hellfire, grasping shadowy tentacles, or
disruptive necromantic energy. They often rely on zealous minions to
protect them from melee opponents. 

Priests usually know several spells, such as how to banish or control
creatures from other dimensions, create an area of darkness, see and
hear remote locations, speak with the dead, mesmerize or paralyze a
person, cause blindness, or create a ward against energy damage. They
also have the following magical abilities: 

• Curse: The priest curses a foe within short range, hindering all of
the foe’s actions by two steps. 

• Heal: The priest heals a touched creature for 10 health or removes an
affliction such as a disease or curse. 

• Necromancy: The priest uses a ten-minute ritual to animate up to four
human-sized corpses as skeletons or zombies under their control. The
undead revert to corpses after a day. 

• Sacrifice: The priest uses a ten-minute ritual to kill a helpless,
restrained, or unconscious creature of level 4 or higher, using its soul
to grant one ally an asset on all actions and defenses for one day. 

• Summon: Once per hour the priest can summon a demon or one level 3 or
4 creature (such as a giant snake, giant spider, or swarm of bugs). The
summoned creature serves the priest for an hour before vanishing. 

Swarm of bugs: level 3

• An evil priest usually has one or two combat-useful manifest cyphers
and often has an artifact appropriate to their religion. Most also wear
armor or have an ongoing defensive spell that grants them Armor. 

Interaction: Evil priests tend to be knowledgeable, arrogant, and
condescending toward heroes and members of rival faiths. They might
strike a bargain to save their lives or the life of a valuable minion,
or to gain an advantage later on. 

Use: An evil priest is converting frightened peasants into followers,
and turning those who refuse into zombie slaves. A new religious figure
in the city is acting suspiciously, and members of rival faiths have
been disappearing or turning up dead. 

Loot: Evil priests usually have mundane treasures equivalent to three or
four expensive items, a few useful manifest cyphers, and an artifact.

GM intrusions:The dying evil priestutters a curse thatattempts to pull
the character’s soul intothe afterlife with them,moving them one
stepdown the damagetrack if they fail anIntellect defense roll.

The evil priest ignores, avoids, or immediately recovers from an attack
that would have killed orgreatly harmed them.

FAERIE 3 (9)

Faeries are magic creatures of music, mirth, tricks, and taunts. Some
might only perform a silly song or follow people for a while, flitting
around and asking questions like an annoying young child. Some faeries
are crueler and delight in stealing clothing, equipment, or prized
objects. And a few are downright malicious and, under the guise of a
helpful guide or a pretty light in the distance, lure lost travelers to
various dooms. 

Motive: Unpredictable 

Environment: Alone or in a flutter of three to twelve 

Health: 12 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Movement: Immediate; long when flying 

Modifications: Tasks related to performance and deception as level 5;
Speed defense as level 5 due to size and quickness 

Combat: A faerie can hurl damaging magic dust at any target within short
range, but sometimes it wields tiny weapons such as bows, spears, or
swords. 

If a faerie is touched or struck by a melee weapon, more magic dust
puffs away from the faerie and clouds the attacker, who must make a
Speed defense roll or take the same amount of damage they just dealt to
the faerie. 

A faerie can see in the dark, but it can also emit bright light and
appear as a glowing humanoid or an illuminated sphere. 

Faeries regenerate 1 point of health per round while their health is
above 0. 

Some faeries can attempt to use a song or light display to charm others
within short range. The target must succeed on an Intellect defense roll
or fall into a suggestible state for one hour. During this period, the
target can be led by the faerie at their regular movement rate. The
target can be brought out of the spell early if they take damage or are
heartily slapped and shaken for a round or two, causing the glamour to
fade. A faerie can use this power once per minute. 

Interaction: Faeries are mercurial creatures, but except for the
malicious ones, they can be negotiated with, especially if offered
sweets, wine, or other gifts. However, faerie attention spans are
limited, so even one that means well could end up leaving the PCs in the
lurch at just the wrong moment. 

Use: The dancing light in the distance, leading curious PCs deeper and
deeper into the dark woods, is a faerie. And the destination could be a
wicked witch or other unpleasant location.

Loot: The tiny pouches that faeries carry are stuffed with forest
bric-a-brac, but some of those pouches are ten times larger on the
inside and might hold a handful of shiny coins or a cypher.

GM intrusion: Another faerie appears, and if the character fails a Speed
defense roll, it flies off with their weapon or another  
important possession.

FALLEN ANGEL 5 (15)

Angels are normally associated with virtue and service to higher moral
beings. But just like people, sometimes angels are tempted into impure
acts. Those who stray too far over the line may fall from higher realms
and be forced to walk the Earth in penance. This experience drives most
fallen angels insane.

Fallen angel abilities wax and wane according to the position of the
sun. During the day, a fallen angel seems almost sane (and is less
dangerous), but at night, it is volatile and threatening to everyone.

Motive: Revenge (but on whom and for what isn’t clear, even to the
fallen angel)

Environment: Anywhere, sometimes living alone in the wilderness, other
times walking the hard streets of large cities

Health: 25

Damage Inflicted: 6 points by day, 8 points at night

Armor: 2

Movement: Short; long when flying

Modifications: At night, perceptions and attacks as level 7

Combat: At night, a fallen angel can attack other creatures by
projecting a long-range beam of burning light. Against foes within
immediate range, the fallen angel manifests burning wings. A fallen
angel can choose to make its attacks ignore Armor, but for each attack
so modified, it loses 4 points of health.

On the rare occasion that a fallen angel is within immediate range of
another of its kind, both regain 1 point of health per round.

By day, a fallen angel cannot project  
long-range attacks and has no visible wings with which to make melee
attacks, though it may carry a melee weapon.

Interaction: By day, fallen angels are not automatically hostile, and
they can be negotiated and reasoned with. They can seem truly angelic,
though they are often confused and forgetful of their origin. But when
night descends, fallen angels lose control of their faculties as they
swell with rage and power. Unless a character directs a fallen angel
toward another creature on which it can vent its wrath, the character
becomes the object of the fury.

Use: A star slips down from the sky and lands in the country. The next
day, travelers come upon a farm in the area and find everyone dead and
burned. A trail of scorched earth leads up into the hills.

Loot: Fallen angels collect cyphers and usually have a few.

GM intrusion: A fallen angel’s successful attack causes the character’s
cypher to detonate (if a grenade) or otherwise activate in a  
less-than-ideal fashion.

FUSION HOUND 3 (9)

In radiation-scoured wastelands, either creatures adapt to the deadly
energies of their environment, or they die. Fusion hounds are mutant
canines able to absorb unbelievable amounts of radiation and thrive on
it. They roam in packs, killing and devouring everything they come upon.

A fusion hound’s entire head appears to be a blast of flame, and gouts
of dangerous radiation flare from its body.

Motive: Hungers for flesh

Environment: Packs of three to eight can be found almost anywhere.

Health: 10

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Long

Modifications: Speed defense as level 4; stealth and climbing as level 2

Combat: Fusion hounds move very fast and use that speed to their
advantage in combat. A hound can move a long distance and still attack
as a single action. It can also use its action to run about in random
patterns, hindering attacks against it by two steps.

A fusion hound’s head is completely haloed in a seething mass of
radioactive energy, so unlike traditional canines, it has no bite
attack. Instead, it pounces on prey with its clawed forelimbs, which
causes a burst of radiation to flare from its body, burning whatever it
touches.

Anyone within close distance of a fusion hound for more than one round
suffers 1 point of damage in each round after the first.

Interaction: Fusion hounds are animals. Creatures immune to radiation
sometimes train the hounds to become guardians or hunting dogs, but such
creatures are rare.

Use: An NPC delivering something the characters need never made it to
the rendezvous. If they backtrack to where the NPC should have come
from, the PCs are attacked by a pack of fusion hounds on the road.
Clearly, the courier was attacked by the pack as well, and the
characters must discover if the NPC is dead or merely injured, and where
the package now lies.

GM intrusion: The hound flares with energy and the character must
succeed on a Might defense task or go blind for ten minutes.

GHOST 4 (12)

Sounds with no apparent origin, such as the tap of footsteps on the
stair, knocking behind the walls, crying from empty rooms, and haunting
music, might be signs of a ghost. If the sound is accompanied by a
sudden temperature drop and the breath of living creatures begins to
steam, it’s a certainty.

Ghosts are the spectral remnants of humans, which persist either as
fragments of memory or as full-fledged spirits. Though their appearance
varies between individuals, many appear somewhat translucent, washed
out, or physically warped from their time spent as a phantom.

Motive: Unpredictable (but often seeking to complete unfinished
business)

Environment: Almost anywhere

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Stealth as level 7; tasks related to frightening others
as level 6

Combat: A ghost doesn’t take damage from mundane physical sources, but
it takes half damage from spells and attacks that direct energy, and
full damage from weapons designed to affect spirits, psychic attacks,
and similar attacks.

A ghost’s touch inflicts freezing damage. Some ghosts can kill victims
with fear. A ghost with this ability can attack all creatures within
short range with a psychic display so horrible that targets who fail an
Intellect defense roll take 4 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor)
and become terrified, freezing in place. In each subsequent round, a
terrified victim can attempt an Intellect-based task to push away the
fright. Each failed attempt moves the victim one step down the damage
track. Not attempting to clear one’s mind of fear counts as a failed
attempt. Those killed by fear are marked by expressions of horror and
hair that has turned white.

A ghost can move through solid objects of up to level 7 at will,
although it can choose to pick up and manipulate objects if it focuses
on them. Ghosts can also go into a state of apparent  
non-existence for hours or days at a time.

Interaction: Some ghosts are talkative, some don’t know they’re dead,
some want help for a task  
they failed to accomplish in life, and some only rage against the living
and want to bring those who yet breathe into the same colorless
existence they endure.

Use: A ghost (that at first appears fully human) wants help in
eradicating a guild of ghost hunters that has targeted it and a few
others haunting an abandoned structure. The ghost promises to tell
secrets of the afterlife to any who accept its strange offer.

Loot: A ghost usually doesn’t carry objects, though some might have a
keepsake (like an amulet showing the face of a loved one) or an
artifact.

GM intrusion: The character must succeed on an Intellect defense roll or
be possessed by the ghost until they succeed on an Intellect-based task
to push it out. While possessed, the character acts just like the ghost
did when it was alive.

GHOUL 4 (12)

Ghouls spend almost as much time beneath the ground as corpses do, but
ghouls are very much alive. Their bodies are hairless and so
porcelain-smooth that their faces are sometimes mistaken for masks,
albeit gore-smeared masks. Ghouls come to the surface at night to gather
humanoid remains or steal those recently interred from their graves,
though many prefer to eat from still-living victims.

Most ghouls are orgiastic eaters of human flesh, but a rare few ghoul
populations are more refined. These wear clothes, have language and
sophisticated customs, live in grand subterranean cities of their own
design, and fight with milk-white blades of bone. These civilized ghouls
claim to hold dominion over the remains of all humans, according to
ancient custom, even if they only sometimes assert that privilege. They
eat the dead in order to absorb residual memories left in the corpses.

Motive: Hunger for dead flesh; knowledge (in certain rare cases)

Environment: Anywhere above ground at night, usually in groups of three
or more, or in subterranean lairs

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Two areas of knowledge as level 5

Combat: Ghoul saliva contains a paralytic agent. Ghoul bites (and
weapons used by ghouls) inflict damage and, on a failed Might defense
roll, render the target paralyzed for one minute. A paralyzed target can
attempt a Might-based task each round to regain mobility, but for the
next minute, attacks, defenses, and movement tasks are hindered.

Ghouls can see in the dark. They’re blind in full daylight, but
civilized ghouls who travel to the surface carry lenses that cover their
eyes, allowing them to see without penalty in full sunlight.

Interaction: Common ghouls can’t be negotiated with, though a rare
civilized ghoul is an excellent linguist. These latter are willing to
deal in return for the body of someone who was knowledgeable or who kept
valuable secrets in life.

Use: If a PC needs a piece of information not otherwise obtainable, a
trip down into a ghoul city might be worthwhile, for the creatures are
rumored to keep lightless libraries below the earth that store knowledge
once known by humans.

Loot: If the PCs defeat a group of civilized ghouls, they might find a
cypher and a few sets of black goggles that allow the wearer to look
directly at the sun and see it as a pale circle.

GM intrusion: The ghoul spits in the character’s eye, directly
introducing the paralytic into the victim’s bloodstream. The victim’s
Might defense roll to avoid becoming paralyzed is hindered.

GIANT 7 (21)

Violent storms, earthquakes, typhoons, and other natural disasters draw
giants. Standing 20 to 30 feet (6 to 9 m) tall, giants delight in
rampaging through the middle of such calamities, creating even more
destruction. Some giants grow so powerful that they can trigger natural
disasters on their own.

Motive: Destruction

Environment: Underground, deserts, mountaintops, and similar desolate
areas

Health: 40

Damage Inflicted: 9 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short

Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to size; breaks and throws
objects as level 8; sees through deceptions and tricks as level 3

Combat: Giants smash foes with their fists, possibly catching up to
three human-sized targets with the same attack if all the targets are in
immediate range of each other.

If a giant attacks a single target, they can choose to do regular damage
or to grab hold of the victim, dealing 4 points of damage instead. On
their turn, the victim can attempt a Might defense roll to struggle out
of the grip, a Speed defense roll to slip out, or an Intellect-based
task to distract the giant. If the victim fails, the giant throws the
victim as high and as far as they can on their next turn. Damage on
impact varies, depending on the environment, but a victim takes an
average of 10 points of ambient damage.

A few giants can generate storms, tidal waves, earthquakes, and similar
phenomena that can lash an area up to 1,000 feet (300 m) across for up
to a minute, inflicting 3 points of damage each round to all creatures
and objects not protected by shelter designed to withstand a storm
(though few shelters protect against an earthquake).

Interaction: Most giants are not very bright. When a giant is rampaging,
someone could attempt to distract them by singing, juggling, or doing
some other trick, which some giants will pause to watch for at least one
or two rounds.

Use: A giant came down out of the mountains and laid waste to half the
nearby village. Survivors will pay someone to venture into the giant’s
mountain lair and destroy the creature.

Loot: Individual giants carry little, but giant lairs may contain
currency equivalent to 1d6 expensive items, 1d6 cyphers, and a couple of
artifacts.

GM intrusion: The giant’s blow sprains one of the character’s limbs,
making it useless for ten minutes.

GIANT RAT 3 (9)

Giant rats are as large as big attack dogs, just as vicious, and more
wily. Some giant rats are the lone matriarchs of a pack of ordinary
level 1 rats, and others are just one of several making up a colony of
oversized rodents. Like their smaller cousins, giant rats are known for
harboring virulent disease.

Motive: Defense, reproduction

Environment: Anywhere in ruins or sewers, in groups of one to seven

Health: 18

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Movement: Short; long when jumping

Modifications: Perception as level 4; tasks related to overcoming
obstacles and puzzles as level 5

Combat: Victims damaged by a giant rat’s diseased teeth and claws take 4
points of damage and, on a failed Might defense roll, are infected with
a level 5 disease. Within twelve hours, the victim’s lymph glands swell,
creating visible buboes. Every twelve hours thereafter, the victim must
succeed on a Might defense roll or take 5 points of ambient damage.

Interaction: Giant rats stubbornly pursue prey, but they flee if that
prey proves to be too strong.

Use: A contact of the PCs dies of plague before they can deliver an
important message. The PCs will have to backtrack the contact’s
movements to discover what they wanted to say, which leads to a giant
rat colony.

GM intrusion: A swarm of twelve ordinary rats—each level 1, but acting
like a level 3 swarm—is summoned by the high-pitched squeaking of a
giant rat.

GIANT SNAKE 4 (12)

Those about to stumble into the presence of a giant snake at least 50
feet (15 m) long are warned by the skin it shed and discarded and by the
cracked, slippery bones of digested victims.

Motive: Hungers for flesh

Environment: Anywhere a giant snake can lurk, including jungles, sewers,
caves, and spacecraft access tubes

Health: 18

Damage Inflicted: 5 points or more; see Combat

Armor: 2

Movement: Short

Modifications: Perception and stealth as level 6; Speed defense as level
3 due to size

Combat: A giant snake bites foes, preferably from ambush, hindering the
target’s Speed defense by two steps. If it succeeds, the snake’s bite
deals 8 points of damage for that attack. On a failed Might defense
roll, a bite also inflicts 3 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor). A
giant snake may coil around a sleeping, stunned, or debilitated victim.
Caught victims automatically take 5 points of crushing damage each round
until they break free.

Giant snakes lose their perception and stealth modifications in cold
climates and when attacked with abilities that reduce the temperature.
Thus, the creatures retreat from cold.

Interaction: A giant snake is a predator that regards other creatures as
food, though it ignores them when it is already busy digesting a meal.

Use: Characters note something amiss as they glimpse lambent eyes
peering from the darkness, glaring as if seeking to pin victims in place
with cold terror.

Loot: A giant snake’s droppings or gullet might hold a few cyphers and
possibly an artifact that the creature could not digest.

GM intrusion: The snake’s venom affects the character more strongly.
Instead of merely inflicting Speed damage, it also paralyzes the
character for one minute, though after a couple of rounds, the victim
can make another Might defense roll to throw off the effects of the
poison early.

GIANT SPIDER 3 (9)

Giant spiders result most commonly from radioactive accidents, magic, or
genetic manipulation. Whatever their origin, they’re terrifying hunters
large enough to predate people. The creatures range from the size of a
large dog to the size of a large horse.

Motive: Hungers for blood

Environment: Anywhere webs can be spun in the dark

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 3 points

Movement: Short; long when traveling on their webs

Modifications: Perception as level 5; Speed defense as level 4 due to
quickness

Combat: A giant spider’s envenomed fangs inflict 3 points of damage,
plus 3 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) if a victim fails a Might
defense roll. Debilitated victims are not killed but instead cocooned
and hung for later dining. Giant spider webs (level 4) can hold victims
immobile and unable to take actions until they manage to break free.

Giant spiders lose their perception and Speed defense modifications in
bright light and thus often retreat from intense illumination.

Interaction: Most giant spiders are simple predators and react
accordingly.

Use: Giant spider webs can infest unlit alleys, dungeon corridors, dark
forests, and darkened hallways of decommissioned genetic labs.

Loot: Cocooned corpses of previous victims hanging in a giant spider’s
web sometimes contain all manner of valuables, including cyphers.

GM intrusion: Giant spider eggs hatch, and a level 3 swarm of tiny
spiders attacks the character.

Goblin 1 (3)

Goblins are wicked, grasping, and perversely resourceful. Usually no
larger than children, they can seem like pesky rabble, but that illusion
hides something altogether more cunning. Tribe members work together to
accomplish their goals of murder, kidnapping, and theft.

Motive: Greed and theft

Environment: Tunnels and caves, usually in groups of ten or more

Health: 3

Damage Inflicted: 2 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Tasks related to perception, stealth, and setting traps
as level 5

Combat: Goblins attack from the shadows with ambushes and hit-and-run
tactics. When they have surprise, they attack as level 4 creatures and
deal 2 additional points of damage, and they attempt to draw larger prey
into level 5 traps they’ve previously set. They often flee in the face
of real danger.

Interaction: Goblins are lying tricksters but can be cowed into
cooperating for short periods.

Use: Thieves and murderers, goblins are foes to all, even rival goblin
tribes.

Loot: Aside from weapons, each goblin carries a personal stash,
including bones, shiny rocks, sticks, and other bits of worthless trash,
plus currency equivalent to an inexpensive item.

GM intrusion: The goblin poisoned its knife. If struck, the character
must make a Might defense roll or immediately move one step down the
damage track.

GOLEM 6 (18)

Animate creatures of stone created by magic for a specific purpose,
golems usually serve as guardians. However, they may also serve as
soldiers, couriers, and banner-bearers. Golems that have accomplished
their task may spend years without moving, like statuary posed in
unexpected places—stained, eroded, and forlorn. But if disturbed, a
golem rumbles back to movement and attempts to restart the last task
assigned to it by its maker.

Motive: Seeks to fulfill the commands of its creator

Environment: Anywhere that needs a sturdy magical guardian

Health: 30

Damage Inflicted: 8 points

Armor: 5

Movement: Short

Modifications: Intellect defense as level 2; Speed defense as level 4
due to slowness

Combat: Skilled with large two-handed weapons, golems inflict 2
additional points of damage (total of 8 points) when using them. Golems
cannot be stunned or dazed. They are immune to most poisons and disease,
and 2 of their 5 points of Armor protect against ambient damage
(environmental damage, heat, cold, falling, and so on).

On the other hand, golems are activated by light, even light as dim as a
candle. In complete darkness, a golem is blind and suffers penalties to
attack and defend normally. A golem subject to complete darkness may
choose to freeze in place like a statue. When one does so, its Armor
increases to 10 (and Armor against ambient damage increases to 5), but
it can take no actions, including purely mental actions. Unless
something can damage the golem through its Armor, it remains frozen
indefinitely or until light returns.

Even if a golem is completely destroyed, the rubble of its form slowly
reassembles over the course of three days, unless that rubble is ground
to the finest gravel and spread widely.

Interaction: Most golems can’t speak. Those that can are mournful, and a
few have become cruel in their isolation, but at heart, all are lonely.
Many are also tired of their stone existence, in which they can move but
not really feel, and they wish for some sort of final end.

Use: Powerful sorcerers sometimes create golems and press them into
service with yet more spells. These golems prove to be tough bodyguards,
but sometimes the futility of such service overcomes a golem and it
turns on the sorcerer, breaking free of the binding spells in its rage
over being denied the peace of death.

GM intrusion: The character hit by the golem is also grabbed and
headbutted for 6 additional points of damage. The victim must break or
slip free, or else they remain in the golem’s grip.

GORGON 5 (15)

Statues littering the grounds outside a ruin are meant to deter savvy
robbers and explorers. The statues, ranging in size from birds to
warriors astride steeds, all depict creatures in states of fright and
pain, the final image of death. These pieces are not the work of a
fevered mind, but the fates of those who braved a gorgon’s lair. Gorgons
were humans once. After they offended the gods with their vanity, they
were transformed into hideous monsters. A gorgon has the upper body of a
human of perfect form and physique, but the lower body of a giant
serpent, complete with rattling tail. One who dares look at a gorgon’s
face can see traces of the old beauty beneath a weary veneer, darkened
by hatred. Instead of hair, serpents crown a gorgon’s head, snapping and
hissing at anyone who draws near. Yet the most terrible aspect of a
gorgon is its gaze, which can turn any creature to stone. 

Motive: Isolation, defense 

Environment: Alone, sequestered in the isolated ruins of old cities and
castles 

Health: 12 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Movement: Short 

Combat: A gorgon has a long-range bow attack. Since creatures that see
the gorgon often turn to stone, it must take down its prey at long range
so it can get fresh meat. In close combat, a gorgon lashes out with a
long dagger or, rarely, a sword. As part of the action the gorgon uses
to attack, the serpents on its head can also attack one target within
immediate distance. A target that fails its Speed defense roll takes 2
points of damage from the bite and must immediately make a Might defense
roll to resist the poison (which deals 4 additional points of Speed
damage that ignores Armor). 

Anyone within short range of a gorgon who meets its gaze and fails a
Might defense roll turns to stone. In combat, when a character within
short distance attacks the gorgon, they must avert their gaze (which
hinders the attack by two steps) or make a Might defense roll. On a
failure, they take 5 points of ambient damage as their flesh partly
mineralizes. If the character is killed by this damage, they are turned
to stone.

 Some gorgons carry a couple of cyphers and perhaps an artifact that
they can use in combat. 

Interaction: Bitterness consumes gorgons. They lead lonely lives, cut
off from everyone they have loved. Negotiating with one would be
something of a feat. 

Use: A gorgon’s head retains its power to petrify for several days after
being cut from the creature. The PCs might brave the gorgon so they can
use its head to defeat an even more powerful foe. 

Loot: A gorgon typically has a few cyphers and may have an artifact as
well.

GM intrusion: A character glimpsesa gorgon’s eyes, and a sheen of stone
covers their body for one minute, during which time they gain +1 to
Armor but can’t move farther than an immediate distance in one round.

GREY 4 (12)

Greys are enigmatic creatures born of alien stars (or dimensions) who
have learned to move across the vast distances that bridge neighboring
star systems. The creatures descend through the atmosphere under the
cover of night to abduct specimens for study and return the victims
later after a thorough examination. Returned abductees are usually
befuddled and confused, and they retain little memory of what happened
to them. Victims of the greys’ examination frequently sport strange
marks on their flesh, oddly shaped wounds, gaps where teeth used to be,
and strange or unknown metal lodged somewhere under the skin.

A grey stands 3 feet (1 m) tall. It has a narrow body with skinny limbs
and a large, bulbous head. Two large black eyes, almond shaped, dominate
a face that has only a suggestion of a nose and a narrow mouth. Greys
wear skintight uniforms, carry numerous instruments to study their
environments, and keep a weapon or two for protection.

Motive: Knowledge

Environment: Greys land their spacecraft in remote areas, where they
have minimal risk of discovery.

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short

Modifications: All tasks related to knowledge as level 6; Speed defense
as level 5 due to size and quickness

Combat: A grey carries a powerful ray emitter that can burn holes
through solid steel. The grey can use the emitter to attack targets
within long range. Against dangerous opponents, a grey can use an action
to activate a personal shield that encapsulates it in a bubble of force.
The shield gives it +3 to Armor, but while the shield is active, the
grey can’t fire its ray emitter.

Greys are scientists, but cautious ones. Leaving a trail of corpses as
evidence of their existence isn’t their preferred mode of operation. For
this reason, one grey in every group has a memory eraser. When this grey
activates the device, each target other than a grey within short range
must succeed on an Intellect defense roll or become stunned for one
minute, taking no action (unless attacked, which snaps the victim out of
the condition). When the effect wears off naturally, the target has no
recollection of encountering little grey creatures.

Interaction: Greys are curious about the places they visit but reluctant
to move or act in the open. Secretive and mysterious, they prefer to
observe creatures from afar and, on occasion, pick them up for closer
inspection. Someone who offers a grey true knowledge might be treated as
an equal rather than a lab animal.

Use: The PCs are called to investigate a series of disappearances of
animals and people. One by one, the abductees return, usually in odd
places, and always bearing physical markings that suggest they were
subjected to invasive procedures. To protect others from a similar fate,
the PCs must catch the abductors in the act.

Loot: A grey has one or two cyphers and might have a memory  
eraser that works as described under Combat (depletion roll  
of 1–2 on a 1d10).

GM intrusion: A grey’s ray emitter suffers a terrible mishap and
explodes. The device kills the grey and destroys its body completely.
For the next day, creatures that come within a short distance of where
the grey died take 4 points of ambient damage from the psychic radiation
each round they remain there.

HAG 6 (18)

Hags are evil magical creatures distantly related to the fey. They
resemble withered ancient humans with obvious inhuman features—dead
eyes, green or purple skin, metal teeth, webbed fingers, and
seaweed-like hair are common traits. They love corrupting pure and
innocent things, and feast on the dreams and flesh of their victims. 

Motive: Power, treachery 

Environment: Forests, swamps, mountains, and unpleasant natural
locations 

Health: 25 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Lying, haggling, magical lore, mimicking voices, and
Intellect defense as level 7 

Combat: Hags can attack with their iron-hard claws and teeth, but often
rely on their magic abilities in combat. Hags can breathe water, and
usually have three or more of the following abilities: 

• Arcane blast: Use magical energy to blast one foe within short range
and inflict 6 points of damage, or divide this energy (and damage) among
several foes as the hag sees fit (each foe makes their own Speed defense
roll against this attack). 

• Change shape: Transform into a humanoid or common animal, or return to
their own form. 

• Curse: Curse a creature within long range, hindering all physical
actions by two steps. 

• Fear: Terrify all creatures within short range who look upon them,
causing the creatures to flee for one minute if they fail an Intellect
defense roll. 

• Illusion: Create an illusion affecting a small area that includes
light, sound, and smell. They can use this to disguise themselves as any
humanoid creature (such as a human, dwarf, or elf). Changing or
maintaining the illusion is not an action. 

• Invisibility: Turn invisible for ten minutes. When invisible, they are
specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. 

• Murderous glare: Glare at one opponent, causing bloody wounds that
inflict 6 points of damage if the creature is within short range (3
points if within long range). 

• Question: Get an answer to a very simple, general question about a
creature or place within 1 mile (1.5 km). 

• Scrying eye: View any familiar location within 1 mile as if they were
observing it directly. 

• Sleep: Make a creature fall asleep for one minute. Damage or loud
noises will wake the creature. 

Three or more allied hags form a coven, which allows them to use each
other’s magical abilities, and usually grants the coven (when working
together) one or two additional abilities. 

Interaction: Hags are evil, greedy, hateful, and cruel. They rarely do
things for others unless they benefit in some way, and they like to
trick fools into dangerous tasks that end up profiting the hag instead
of anyone else. If shown proper respect and bribed or paid, a hag can be
a valuable source of lore. 

Use: The smell of cakes lures children to a mysterious woodland shack.
The hag of the swamp is said to kill anyone who enters their territory
without carrying a specific gift. 

Loot: In addition to coins and jewels, a hag usually has several scrolls
or potions and may have an artifact.

GM intrusion: A creature becomes afraid and reluctant to oppose the hag,
hindering all actions against the hag by two steps for one day.

HARPY 3 (9)

A harpy is a hideous, filthy creature with the body of a large vulture
and the neck and head of an ugly human. Their breath reeks of decay,
their wings and talons drip with an unpleasant oil, and their eyes shed
acrid tears. They love to torment people and lure them to their deaths. 

Motive: Hungers for flesh, causing anguish 

Environment: Coastline, forest, and mountains 

Health: 9 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Movement: Short; long when flying 

Modifications: Perception and Speed defense as level 4 

Combat: Harpies are fast and strong, capable of carrying off a light
adult human. They attack with their long talons. 

Anything a harpy touches becomes fouled with their smelly fluids, and
one harpy energetically flapping their wings is enough to contaminate an
immediate area. Their fluids are repulsive but not directly harmful, and
the smell persists even after a casual washing. Any food touched by
harpy filth is inedible to anyone but a harpy. Creatures with a
sensitive sense of smell (such as dogs and wolves) are hindered when
within a short distance of a harpy. It is common for a group of harpies
to attack a campsite or festival, spread their stink over everything,
and fly away with whatever food they can carry.

A harpy can sing a weird, entrancing song that hypnotizes whoever hears
it. Anyone within long range who hears the song must make an Intellect
defense roll or stop whatever they are doing and attempt to approach the
harpy. If the creature comes within an immediate distance of a singing
harpy, they stand there dumbly even as the harpy attacks them. The
creature can make another attempt to break free each round on its turn,
and taking damage from anything other than a singing harpy allows them
another attempt to break free. Five or more harpies can work together on
the same song (treat as a level 5 effect). Harpies are cruel and have
been known to lead an entranced creature into a pit, off a cliff, or
over the railing of a ship. 

Interaction: Other than their singing, harpies do not usually speak with
other creatures. They are more likely to jeer and screech at people like
an angry bird than try to communicate. 

Use: A flock of harpies torments a village during its harvest festival,
ruining the celebration and some of the food set aside for the winter.
Sailors speak of a lonely island where an old, blind king starves
because harpies steal or foul any food set out for him. 

Loot: A harpy nest may have one or two cyphers or other valuables, but
the items will smell disgusting unless carefully washed.

GM intrusion: A harpy snatches something a character is wearing or
carrying on a failed Speed defense roll. The harpy throws away or flees
with the stolen item

HOLLOW KNIGHT 4 (12)

In haunted castles and among the armies mustered by those with power
over life and death, sometimes walk hollow knights. These animated suits
of armor move just like living people, and many who encounter these
dread revenants mistake them for living foes only to realize in horror
that there’s nothing inside except for the memory of the warrior that
once donned the suit. Brought into being by binding the spirit of a dead
warrior to its panoply, hollow knights behave in much the same way they
did in life—disciplined, loyal, and battle ready. Clad head to toe in
full plate armor, with battered shields strapped to their arms and rusty
swords gripped in lobster gauntlets, the knights stand ready to face any
foe, heedless of the danger, driven to serve the necromancer that made
them. Hollow knights might ride on the backs of skeletal steeds and
wield lances. 

Motive: Obedience to its master 

Environment: Anywhere 

Health: 12 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Armor: 3 

Movement: Short; long while mounted on a skeletal steed 

Skeletal steed: level 4

Modifications: Resists fear and intimidation as level 10 

Combat: A hollow knight usually fights with a sword or mace. 

When mounted on a steed, a hollow knight charges its enemies whenever
possible. As an action, its steed moves a short distance, and the hollow
knight can make a single attack at any point during this movement. When
attacking in this way, the knight inflicts 7 points of damage. 

A hollow knight is fearless and fights until destroyed or ordered to
pull back. The magic animating its armor is slow to fade, so armor
components may continue to twitch and jerk even after the knight has
fallen. Usually, when defeated, the suit of armor falls apart, and wisps
of grey smoke curl up from the remains. 

Interaction: Hollow knights cannot speak. They obey any orders given to
them by their creators. 

Use: The necromancer or other magician that binds the spirit to the
armor also imbues the armor with specific commands—tasks the knight must
carry out until destroyed. Some knights may stand guard at citadels or
mansions, keeping a vigil until their armor finally falls apart. Others
are more active and may function as the core of a dark wizard’s army.

GM intrusion: When a hollow knight is destroyed, a gauntlet flies up,
grabs a character, and won’t let go. A difficulty 7 Might task is
required to pry it loose

HYDRA 7 (21)

This mythological reptile has five writhing serpent heads, each of which
constantly exhales a venomous plume. Well over 20 feet (6 m) long from
the tip of its longest head to its thrashing tail, the toxic beast’s
most discomfiting feature is its magical ability to sprout new heads
when it’s wounded. Some hydras dwell on land, others in water. Most seem
to have been set as guardians of important places by higher powers,
which is probably why they’re so difficult to kill. 

Motive: Hungers for flesh, defend a location 

Environment: Swamps, coasts, and forests 

Health: 24 

Damage Inflicted: 7 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short when walking or swimming 

Modifications: Perception as level 8 due to its many heads; Speed
defense as level 5 due to size 

Combat: Even approaching a hydra is dangerous; the air around it is
poisoned by its venomous breath. Each round a creature is within
immediate range of a hydra, they must succeed on a Might defense task or
take 1 point of Speed damage (ignores Armor). 

All five of a hydra’s heads can simultaneously bite foes in immediate
range. If three or more heads coordinate their attack, the heads make
one attack as a single level 9 creature dealing 9 points of damage. A
target bitten by the venomous hydra must also succeed on a Might defense
task or take an additional 2 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor). 

Whenever the hydra takes 4 or more points of damage from a single
attack, a healing pulse surges through the creature a round later. The
pulse returns the health just subtracted due to the attack and triggers
the immediate growth of two additional heads that sprout from the
creature. (The same thing happens if one of the creature’s snakelike
heads is decapitated.) The new heads are just as effective as the
original ones in a fight. Fire, electrical, and other extreme energy
attacks do not trigger the healing pulse and head genesis. 

Interaction: A hydra is a cunning predator, but not intelligent. It
can’t bargain or negotiate. 

Use: The PCs investigate an ancient ruin hoping to find artifacts of the
gods. A hydra saw them enter and trails them through the crumbling
structure at a considerable distance, waiting for them to take a rest or
become otherwise distracted before attacking.

 Loot: Hydras sometimes collect cyphers and artifacts in their lair, or
failing that, they guard something of value.

GM intrusion: The character reacts poorly to the poison in the air or a
bite and goes intonhelpless convulsions for one round if they fail a
Might defense task.

JOTUNN (NORSE GIANT)

Jotunns are a type of giant—large, somewhat intelligent, bad-tempered,
and cultured in their own way, but generally hostile to humans and other
“little folk.” Jotunns range from 9 to 20 feet (3 to 6 m) tall, are
strong, have long hair, and wear armor and use weapons like humans do.
Some are hideous, some are attractive by human standards, and some have
multiple heads. They live in caves, lodges, or large castles. There are
two main types of jotunns: fire and frost.

JOTUNN, FIRE 6 (18)

Fire jotunns are often called fire giants. Their skin is coal-grey or
black; their hair is red or gold and may be metal or actual flames. They
prefer hot mountainous climates (particularly volcanoes), wear plate
armor, and use greatswords that glow with the natural heat of their
bodies. 

Motive: Destruction, hungers for flesh, honor 

Environment: Hot mountains, volcanic areas, supernatural fires 

Health: 30 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points plus 3 points from fire 

Armor: 3 (immune to fire) 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to size; breaks and throws
objects as level 8 

Combat: A fire jotunn uses weapons appropriate to its size (which would
be two-handed for a human but can be wielded one-handed by the giant),
inflicting 6 points of damage plus another 3 points of ambient fire
damage conducted from the jotunn’s body. Jotunns throw boulders up to
very long range, inflicting 6 points of damage plus 3 points of fire
damage. 

A jotunn can inflict 1 point of fire damage with a touch, and anyone
touching it without protection against fire takes damage as if the
jotunn had touched them. A slain fire jotunn and its equipment are too
hot to safely touch for several minutes. 

Fire jotunns are immune to fire damage, but take additional damage from
cold (equal to the attack’s normal damage, up to a maximum of 5
additional points of cold damage). 

Fire jotunn leaders sometimes have magical powers, usually related to
earth and fire. 

Interaction: Fire jotunns tend to be hostile, but they may agree to a
nonlethal challenge to allow visitors to pass through their land or join
them for a feast. 

Use: A fire jotunn decides to cause trouble for intruders in its
territory. A clan of jotunns wages war against a fortified village or
town, hurling boulders, starting fires, and stealing livestock. 

Loot: Jotunns like fine things, and their homes usually have utensils,
plates, weapons, and trophies made of precious metals and decorated with
gems. They may have cyphers, and a leader may carry an artifact.

GM intrusion: The jotunn’s attack inflicts a serious burn, making a limb
useless for an hour or until healed.

JOTUNN, FROST 6 (18)

Frost jotunns are often called frost giants or ice giants. Their skin is
pale white, pink, or blue, and their hair is usually white, pale blond,
or actual ice. They prefer cold mountains and tundra, wear chainmail and
furs, and use metal axes that channel powerful cold from their bodies. 

Motive: Destruction, hungers for flesh, honor 

Environment: Cold mountains and plains 

Health: 30 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points plus 3 points from cold 

Armor: 2 (immune to cold) 

Movement: Short; long when skiing 

Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to size; breaks and throws
objects as level 8 

Combat: A frost jotunn uses weapons appropriate to its size (which would
be two-handed for a human but can be wielded one-handed by the giant),
inflicting 6 points of damage plus another 3 points of ambient cold
damage conducted from the jotunn’s body. Jotunns throw boulders or
chunks of ice up to very long range, inflicting 6 points of damage plus
3 points of cold damage. 

A jotunn can inflict 1 point of cold damage with a touch, and anyone
touching it without protection against cold takes damage as if the
jotunn had touched them. A slain frost jotunn and its equipment are too
cold to safely touch for several minutes. 

Frost jotunns are immune to cold damage, but take additional damage from
fire (equal to the attack’s normal damage, up to a maximum of 5
additional points of fire damage). 

Frost jotunn leaders sometimes have magical powers, usually related to
illusions and weather. 

Interaction: Frost jotunns tend to be hostile, but if in a generous
mood, they may allow visitors to dine with them or rest in their halls.
Once they grant someone hospitality, they are loath to break it unless
they are attacked, robbed, or tricked. 

Use: A frost jotunn throws a boulder just to be threatening. A clever
jotunn offers to share a story in exchange for food and conversation. A
clan of jotunns uses the cover of a storm to raid a village. 

Loot: Jotunns like fine things, and their homes usually have utensils,
plates, weapons, and trophies made of precious materials and decorated
with gems. They may have cyphers, and a leader may carry an artifact.

GM intrusion: The jotunn’s attack numbs one of the character’s limbs,
hindering all actions with it by two steps until it is healed.

KAIJU 10 (30)

Kaiju come in a variety of shapes, but all share one difficult-to-ignore
quality: mind-blowing size. Appearances of these colossal creatures are
rare events that usually don’t last for more than a few days. In that
sense, they’re akin to hundred-year storms and at least as destructive.
When they emerge, they’re attracted by artificial structures, the more
densely situated and elaborate the better, which they set to smashing
with a vengeance. It’s hard to judge the size of things so far outside
normal scale, but good estimates put most kaiju at over 300 feet (90 m)
in height.

Kaiju rely primarily on their strength and mass, but many have some
additional trick or ability that sets them apart from their kin, which
usually translates into even more devastation.

The other quality all kaiju share is the talent of hiding after a
rampage by diving into a nearby sea or burrowing deep into the earth.
Sometimes the same kaiju will appear again days, months, years, or
decades later, attacking the same location or someplace entirely new.

Motive: Destruction

Environment: Usually near communities containing many high structures

Health: 140

Damage Inflicted: 18 points

Armor: 5

Movement: Short

Modifications: Speed defense as level 8 due to size

Combat: A kaiju can punch, kick, or deliver a tail or tentacle lash at
something within long range. Damage is inflicted on the target and
everything within short range of the target, and even those that succeed
on a Speed defense roll take 7 points of damage.

Kaiju heal quickly, usually at a rate of 2 points per round.

Kaiju are rare and devastating enough that most are dubbed with a unique
identifier by survivors. The entry for each creature below notes only
where it varies from the base creature described above.

*Rampagion:* This kaiju has been estimated to be almost 1,000 feet (300
m) high. Once per day, it can make a charging trample attack, dealing
its damage in a line 300 feet (90 m) wide and 2 miles (3 km) long.
Rampagion has 10 Armor and deals 20 points of damage with a physical
attack (or 8 points if a victim makes a successful Speed defense roll).

*Suneko:* This kaiju’s body, which resembles a cross between a lion and
a lizard, is so hot that its skin glows like red coals, its mane like
the sun’s corona, and its eyes like beaming searchlights. Suneko
automatically deals 10 points of damage to everyone within immediate
range. The creature can emit twin rays of plasma from its eyes in a
focused beam that can reach as far as the horizon, which from Suneko’s
height above the ground is about 22 miles (35 km). When it makes its
eyebeam attack, it stops emitting killing heat in immediate range for
about one minute.

Interaction: Most PCs can’t directly interact with a kaiju unless they
have some special device or association allowing them to get the
attention of one of the massive creatures. Doing so could give the
characters a chance to trick or lure the beast, or maybe even persuade
one kaiju to fight another.

Use: After seeing the devastation caused by a kaiju, the PCs might
decide (or be asked) to find a way to stop a projected future appearance
by the same creature.

GM intrusion:  
The character gains the direct attention of the kaiju. If the kaiju
attacks the character, They are awarded 5 XP, only 1 of which they have
to give to a friend.

KILLER CLOWN 5 (15)

A clown—whether it’s a doll or what seems to be a person wearing clown
makeup—could be entirely benign. But if you see one sitting alone in a
dark room, lying under your bed, or gazing up at you through the sewer
grate in the street, it might be a killer clown. Killer clowns might be
evil spirits possessing someone or an insane person living out a
homicidal fantasy. Either way, they’re as dangerous as anything you’ll
ever likely meet. If you see a clown, run. Because it might be a killer.

Motive: Homicide

Environment: Almost anywhere

Health: 25

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Detecting falsehoods, deception, and persuasion as level
7

Combat: A killer clown attempts to deceive its victim into believing
that the clown is a friend. In fact, the clown is setting up an ambush
where the victim can be strangled to death in private. When a killer
clown successfully attacks, it inflicts 5 points of damage and locks its
hands around the victim’s neck. In each round that the victim does not
escape, it suffers 5 points of damage from being strangled.

Some killer clowns know tricks that border on the supernatural. Such a
clown may do one of the following as its action during combat.

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Interaction: A killer clown is all jokes, magic tricks, and juggling,
until it decides it’s time to strike.

Use: The creepy circus that just pulled into town is guarded by a killer
clown, as late-night investigators soon learn.

Loot: A killer clown might have one or two cyphers in the form of a joy
buzzer, cards, and cheap trinkets.

GM intrusion: The clown snatches a weapon, cypher, or other object from
the character’s hand as a level 6 attack, and if successful, immediately
uses it on the character.

KILLING WHITE LIGHT 5 (15)

A killing white light isn’t a subtle hunter. At a distance, the creature
is an eye-watering point of brilliance. When it closes in, it is nothing
less than blinding, though its emanation isn’t warm. Despite the blazing
intensity, a killing white light is as cold as starlight on a December
night, sapping heat and life from living things caught in its radiance.

By day, a killing white light is usually inactive. During this period,
the creature hibernates in darkened areas, as if unwilling or unable to
compete against the sun.

Motive: Eliminate organic life

Environment: Almost anywhere dark

Health: 15

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short when flying

Combat: An active (glowing) killing white light can attack one target
within immediate range each round with a pulse of its brilliant nimbus.
A character who fails a Speed defense roll against the attack takes
damage and experiences a cooling numbness. A victim killed by the
creature is rendered into so much blowing ash, though their clothing and
equipment are unharmed.

As it attacks, a killing white light emits a blinding nimbus of
illumination that affects all creatures within short range. Targets in
the area must succeed on a Might defense roll each round or be blinded
for one round. A character in the area can avert their eyes when
fighting a killing white light to avoid being blinded, but attacks and
defenses are hindered for those who do so.

A killing white light is vulnerable to strong sources of light other
than its own. If exposed to daylight or caught in a high-intensity beam
of light (such as a spotlight), the killing white light falters and
takes no action for one round, after which it can act normally. However,
if the competing light persists for more than three or four rounds, the
creature usually retreats to a darkened place of safety.

Interaction: A killing white light is too alien for interaction and may
not be intelligent in a way humans can understand.

Use: An inactive killing white light (which looks something like an
albino lump of volcanic glass) is sometimes mistaken for a cypher whose
properties can’t quite be identified—until the creature becomes active,
at which point its true nature is revealed.

GM intrusion: Normally resistant to interaction, a killing white light
uses its blazing nimbus to burn an alien glyph of uncertain meaning in
the character’s flesh before the creature fades like a light bulb
switched off.

LICH 8 (24)

A lich is a powerful wizard or priest who has used their knowledge of
necromancy to bind their soul in a magical object called a phylactery,
making them immortal and undead unless their soul object is found and
destroyed. Having corrupted its own life energy in an obscene ritual, a
lich can pursue its other magical goals, usually the acquisition of more
wealth, magic, and power. A newly made lich may look like a recent
corpse, but maintaining its physical vessel becomes less of a priority
as the centuries pass, so over time they tend to look withered or even
skeletal. Liches often work with or command other undead, such as
wraiths, skeletons, vampires, and zombies. 

Motive: Magic, immortality, power 

Environment: Wherever they can remain hidden and work undisturbed 

Health: 45 

Damage Inflicted: 8 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Intellect defense and magical lore as level 10 

Combat: A lich can shoot blasts of necromantic energy that inflict 8
points of damage on a target and 4 points on any creature within
immediate range of the target. A lich knows many spells, such as the
following:

 • Animate guards: Animate ten corpses as skeletons or zombies, which
obey the lich for one hour before turning back into corpses.

 • Armor: Gain +5 Armor for one hour. 

• Death: Inflict 8 points of damage on a creature within short range; if
the creature fails a Might defense roll, it also moves two steps down
the damage track. 

• Fly: For one hour, move through the air as effortlessly as walking. 

• Paralyze: One target within short range is held motionless for two
rounds, unable to take any physical actions. 

• Polymorph: Transform a creature within short range into a harmless
creature like a fish or frog for one minute. 

• Scrying eye: View any familiar location within 1 mile (1.5 km) as if
the lich was observing it directly. 

• Teleport: Move instantly up to 1 mile. A lich also likely carries
several cyphers useful in combat. Liches are undead, and therefore
immune to anything that affects only living creatures, such as disease
and poison. Unless its well-hidden phylactery is destroyed, a lich that
is killed reforms a new body near its phylactery over the next week or
so, returning at full health and with all of its abilities and
memories. 

Interaction: Liches hate being interrupted and have more important
things to do than answer questions from mortal weaklings. A lich may be
convinced to teach a character a spell, especially if given a spell,
cypher, or artifact in trade. 

Use: A lich is planning a ritual to raise an army of skeletons or
zombies to attack the kingdom. A lich has made a pact with a demon to
unleash a plague in exchange for obscure magical knowledge. 

Loot: A lich has 1d6 cyphers and usually an artifact.

GM intrusions: The lich casts a spell in addition to taking other
actions on its turn. The lich uses a cypher, spell, or other ability to
nullify an attack that otherwise would have affected it.

MANTICORE 6 (18)

A manticore is a fearsome predator that resembles a maned red lion with
a human head and a scorpion’s tail. The head is bearded and has three
rows of teeth in the upper and lower jaws, like a shark. The scorpion
tail is covered in multiple barbs, and the creature can flick its tail
to hurl these barbs at its prey. Manticores eat all of their prey,
including the bones, clothing, and equipment, leaving nothing but a
bloodstain as evidence of their hunting. 

Motive: Hungers for flesh (especially human flesh) 

Environment: Mountains and plains 

Health: 22 

Damage Inflicted: 8 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Long 

Modifications: Ranged attacks as level 5 

Combat: Manticores attack with their powerful bite, seeking to
incapacitate or kill one opponent quickly so they can eat. Some are
content to attack and consume a single target, but a large, hungry
manticore prefers to wait until two or three creatures are nearby before
attacking. A manticore has powerful legs and can leap up to a short
distance in any direction, and often surprises its prey by leaping from
concealment. 

Instead of biting, a manticore can use its poisonous scorpion-like tail
to strike one creature in melee with a cluster of barbs, inflicting 4
points of damage (plus 4 additional points of Speed damage if the target
fails a Might defense roll). With a flick of its tail, it can hurl up to
four barbs up to a short distance away, striking one or more creatures
in an immediate area. Each barb inflicts 1 point of damage, and the
target must succeed on a Might defense roll or take 1 additional point
of Speed damage. 

Interaction: Manticores can make trumpet-like noises that resemble
speech, but this seems to be a trick to lure prey. Most of them are not
intelligent enough to know how to speak human languages. 

Use: Weird musical noises resembling speech are heard from the nearby
hills. People have been disappearing in fields and on the road, with
only bloodstains on the ground suggesting that they were harmed. 

Loot: A manticore’s stomach might contain a piece of treasure or a
cypher from a recent meal, and its lair may have one or two small
objects it was unable to digest.

GM intrusion: The manticore attacks with its bite, then spins around to
lash its opponent with its barbed tail.

MECHANICAL SOLDIER 4 (12)

Clockwork automatons powered by steam, these mechanical men patrol about
and guard locations of importance to their makers. Lanky and awkward in
their movements, these quasi-humanoid automatons stand almost 8 feet (2
m) tall. In their three-fingered hands, they wield a variety of weapons.

A few people have wondered if a gear-driven soldier could ever truly
attain sentience. Most scoff at the suggestion, but is that a gleam in
the glass lens of its eye?

Motive: Incomprehensible

Environment: Anywhere, usually in groups of three to eight

Health: 15

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Armor: 3

Movement: Short

Modifications: Perception as level 5; leaps, runs, and balances as level
3

Combat: Mechanical soldiers attack in groups using well-organized
tactics. Although they can speak, they transmit information to one
another silently and instantly within a 100-mile (160 km) range via
wireless radio transmissions.

Soldiers armed with advanced weaponry typically carry rifle-like guns
that can fire multiple rapid shots without reloading. The soldiers fire
at up to three targets (all next to one another) at once. For each
target after the first, defense rolls are eased.

In addition, one in four soldiers carries a back-mounted device that
hurls bombs at long range with deadly accuracy. They explode in
immediate range for  
4 points of damage. Each device holds 1d6  
such bombs.

A mechanical soldier that has lost its original weaponry scavenges
whatever is available.

Certain frequencies of sound confuse these clockwork soldiers, hindering
all their actions by two steps, and other frequencies prevent them from
acting at all for 1d6 + 1 rounds.

Interaction: On their own, mechanical  
soldiers act on prior orders. Otherwise, they listen to and obey their
creator—and only their creator.

Use: An enterprising bandit has captured and repurposed a number of
mechanical soldiers, probably using sound. These soldiers remember
nothing of their former duties and work for their new master as
high-tech brigands and pirates. The bandit has no idea how to repair
them if they are damaged, much less make new soldiers.

Loot: A determined scientist might scavenge the body of one of these
automatons to find a cypher.

GM intrusion: The destroyed soldier explodes in a gout of flame, black
smoke, and steam, inflicting 6 points of damage to all within immediate
range.

MERFOLK 3 (9)

Merfolk are intelligent creatures with humanlike bodies from the waist
up and scaly fish bodies from the waist down. They are able to breathe
air or water but prefer the sea for its beauty and their better
mobility. Merfolk have great underwater cities ruled by a king or queen,
but most land-walking species interact only with the common or soldier
merfolk who visit the ocean surface and coastlines. Merfolk societies
are much like those of surface humans; their inability to use fire
limits them in some ways (such as blacksmithing), but they have
compensated for this with water magic and other skills. 

Merfolk skin ranges from all human colors to green, blue, and grey. Some
have small fins on their heads and elbows or webs between their fingers.
They dress for comfort and wear jewelry made of shells, coral, pearls,
polished gemstones, and metals they can salvage or trade for. Most of
them are content to be hunters or cultivators of kelp and other aquatic
plants, but some are curious about land-walkers (and their sunken ships)
or fiercely territorial about protecting their waters against
outsiders. 

Motive: Defense, entertainment 

Environment: Oceans, seas, and coasts

Health: 9 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Immediate; short when swimming 

Modifications: Perception as level 4 while in water 

Combat: Merfolk use spears, tridents, daggers, and other stabbing
weapons that are effective underwater. They may create traps using nets
to confine or direct foes into an ambush. A few lucky or clever ones
have acquired or adapted light crossbows designed to fire underwater up
to a short distance away. 

About once every ten minutes, a merperson can swim a short distance as
their action and still make a melee attack, or swim up to a long
distance as their action. 

About one in ten merfolk have the magical ability to harden water until
it is as strong and durable as wood, taking about an hour to make a
spear or similar tool that lasts for several days. Some noble merfolk
can create short-range bolts of electricity as an action and make
limited alterations to the weather (stilling, increasing, or dispersing
wind and clouds in a very long area) by concentrating for several
minutes. 

Interaction: Merfolk react according to their role in merfolk
society—farmer, rancher, guard, explorer, noble, and so on. Some merfolk
are more aggressive or hostile and dislike the presence of land-walkers
in their territory. Most merfolk are amiable to conversation and trade
with people who treat them with fairness and respect. 

Use: Merfolk are often seen sunning themselves on a small island off the
coast. Merfolk warriors accompanied by trained large fish have been
harassing boats and ships that stray too far from the shallows and
shores. 

Trained large fish: level 2, attacks as level 3; swims a long distance
each round

Loot: In addition to several small pieces of jewelry, a group of merfolk
might have a manifest cypher. A noble or royal merperson usually has a
cypher and might have an artifact.

GM intrusions: The merfolk’s weapon injects poison, inflicting 5 points
of Speed damage if the character fails a Might defense task. Another
merperson or an allied aquatic creature arrives and joins the fight
against the character.

MI-GO 5 (15)

These extraterrestrial creatures are known as the Fungi from Yuggoth or
the Abominable Ones. They are a bizarre amalgam of insect and fungal
entity, with many limbs and wings that can carry them aloft. They
sometimes enslave humans to work for them in strange factories, mines,
or other  
labor-intensive capacities.

Motive: Knowledge and power

Environment: Usually cold or temperate hills or mountains

Health: 19

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short; long when flying

Modifications: All knowledge tasks as level 6

Combat: Mi-go defend themselves with pincers and claws but are more
likely to use technological devices as weapons. Assume that a mi-go has
one of the following abilities from a device:

Project a blast of electricity at long range that inflicts 6 points of
damage

Emit poison gas in a cloud that fills to short range and inflicts 4
points of Intellect damage if the victim fails a Might defense roll (the
mi-go is immune)

Project a holographic image of itself to one side that hinders attacks
aimed at the real mi-go by two steps

Project a sonic field that provides +2 to Armor

Mi-go have access to other devices as well, including translators,
cylinders that can preserve a human’s brain without its body,
sophisticated tools, collars that control the actions of their wearers,
and weird vehicles. Mi-go suffer no damage from cold and do not need to
breathe.

Interaction: Although very few mi-go speak human languages, peaceful
interaction with these creatures is not impossible. It’s just very
difficult (level 7), as they see most humans as little more than
animals.

Use: The characters are attacked by mi-go intent on capturing and
enslaving them. If caught, the PCs are sent to scavenge through
primordial ruins for disturbing technological relics.

Loot: Mi-go always have 1d6 cyphers as well as many curious objects that
have no obvious human function.

GM intrusion: Fungal spores from the mi-go’s body overcome the
character, who must succeed at a Might defense roll or lose their next
turn. The character faces this risk each round they are within immediate
distance of the creature.

MINOTAUR 4 (12)

Minotaurs are aggressive bull-humanoids who enjoy human flesh. Some
legends say the first minotaur was the result of a curse from a god, and
others suggest it was created by a demon, but the truth is lost to
antiquity. Minotaurs care little about history or their origin,
preferring to hunt for meat and spar with each other for dominance and
trophies. Minotaurs live in small tribes of up to a dozen adults.
Solitary minotaurs are exiles, last survivors of their tribe, or younger
individuals claiming their own territory. 

Motive: Hungers for flesh 

Environment: Caves, plains, and labyrinths 

Health: 19 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Hunting and tracking as level 5 

Combat: Minotaurs attack with their horns or use large weapons. A
minotaur can charge up to a short distance and then make an attack,
which inflicts an additional 3 points of damage. 

Minotaurs are interested in mazes and mazelike spaces and like to wander
within them, memorizing the paths and finding good places to stage
ambushes. They leave out piles of equipment and useless treasures from
previous victims to lure people into the maze and give the minotaur time
to corner their prey. S

ometimes one minotaur in a tribe develops simple magic powers and is
able to create illusions of smoke or mist in an area a short distance
across, turn invisible for a few moments, or enchant weapons to inflict
bleeding wounds. 

Interaction: Minotaurs can speak, usually in their own language or
another crude humanoid language. However, they typically choose not to
speak to weaker creatures (such as humans). 

Use: A wandering gang of minotaurs has been stealing livestock from a
local village and is ready to start hunting humans. A minotaur gladiator
escaped from a secret underground arena and is stalking prey in the
city. Something lurks in a corn maze, leaving nothing but bones and
bloodstains. 

Loot: Minotaurs don’t have much use for coins but keep a few small
trophies, such as ivory dice, gems, or simple jewelry. The most powerful
minotaur in the tribe may have a cypher or even a mastercraft weapon.

GM intrusions: A minotaur smashes a nearby wall, causing part of the
ceiling to collapse on one or more characters, inflicting 6 points of
damage and trapping them until they can escape from the rubble. A
minotaur grabs a character, who can resist with a Might or Speed defense
roll; if they fail, the minotaur takes them up to a short distance away
and disappears (behind an obstacle, into a maze, or in some other hiding
spot)

MOKUREN 3 (9)

Mokuren are usually no larger than a cat, but they possess the ability
to swell until they’re the size of a bus (if only briefly). That
ability, combined with their flashy pyrokinetic tails, make these
creatures a particular favorite with children, at least in stories and
picture books. Given that mokuren can “burrow” into paintings and other
two-dimensional art, it’s possible that some mokuren images are more
than simple representations.

Motive: Play

Environment: Almost anywhere, usually as static images on walls or in
storybooks

Health: 9

Damage Inflicted: 3 points, unless enlarged; see Combat

Movement: Short; long if flying

Modifications: Defends as level 5 due to size, unless enlarged; see
Combat

Combat: A mokuren exists in three states: as an image, as a cat-sized
creature, and as a bus-sized behemoth.

As an image, a mokuren can’t be harmed. Even if the image is defaced,
the mokuren merely “burrows” away and reappears like graffiti on a new
flat space within a few miles.

Alternatively, it could emerge from the image and become a physical
cat-sized creature as a move. In this form, a mokuren can attack with
its claws or bite. It can also direct a stream of fire from its glowing
tail at a target within long range. (When a mokuren flies, it’s by using
its tail to create a jet that rockets it skyward.)

Finally, it can make an enlarged attack, in which it swells to the size
of a bus and swipes at, bites, or lands on a target as part of the same
action. When enlarged, the mokuren gains +5 to Armor and makes and
defends against all attacks as a level 7 creature. On a hit, the
enlarged mokuren deals 7 points of damage. However, a mokuren can remain
enlarged for a total of only four rounds during any twenty-four-hour
period, so it uses this ability sparingly or only when enraged.

Interaction: To see an active mokuren is considered good luck, unless
you manage to get on the wrong side of one. Then an offering of sweets
must be made to the offended creature. A mokuren can’t talk, but it can
understand the languages where it lives about as well as a trained
courser or hound can.

Use: A mokuren can lead characters into unexplored areas, helping them
find places they may have overlooked or skipped. It can also lead PCs
into danger, but it usually does so only to bring aid (the characters)
to someone else in trouble.

GM intrusion: The character hit by the mokuren doesn’t take damage.
Instead, they must succeed on a Might defense roll or be pulled into the
nearest wall, floor, or book with the creature, becoming a
two-dimensional image. In this state, the victim is in stasis until the
mokuren pulls them free, another creature “pries” them loose, or a day
passes and the effect ends naturally.

MORLOCK 2 (6)

Morlocks are degenerate, blind cannibal humanoids that avoid light. They
have prominent teeth, piglike eyes, loose skin, and stooped postures.
They avoid bright daylight and prefer to hunt and forage when it is dark
out (or at least under the twilight-like canopy of a heavy forest).
Morlocks eat any sort of meat, even carrion and their own dead. Morlocks
build piles of stones to mark their territory. On nights of the new
moon, they create unnerving music by playing simple drums made out of
skulls and logs. They lack the foresight to store food for lean times,
so they range farther from home in winter and times of famine. They are
sometimes enslaved by more powerful creatures such as ogres or a
vampire. 

Motive: Hungers for flesh, defense 

Environment: Caves, forests, hills, and underground 

Health: 6 

Damage Inflicted: 2 points 

Movement: Short; short when climbing 

Modifications: Stealth and tracking as level 4 

Combat: Morlocks fight with their nails and teeth, but sometimes they
use simple weapons like clubs, stone knives, spears, and javelins if
they have observed other humanoids doing so. Some tribes dig simple pit
traps and chase prey into them. 

Morlocks dislike strong light but are not harmed by it. Their hearing
and sense of smell is strong enough that they can “see” in dim or very
dim light as if it were normal light. They can track scents as well as a
trained dog. 

Interaction: Morlocks have a simple language of hoots, howls, and growls
that communicate basic concepts like food, fire, danger, and cold. If
enslaved by a more powerful creature, some of them can manage to learn a
few words in that creature’s language. 

Use: Town elders warn that the drums and near-human howls on dark nights
are signs of morlocks who’ll steal away foolish children. Stacked piles
of stones are found in the forest, each surrounded by bare humanoid
footprints. 

Loot: Morlocks don’t value what they can’t eat, but their lair may have
a cypher or two from a recent victim.

GM intrusion: An unnoticed morlock drags away an unconscious character
or animal to be eaten once they’re out of sight.

NECROMANCER 5 (15)

The ability to influence, command, and call up the dead is an impressive
power, given how many more people are dead than living. Since the only
thing separating a living person from a dead one is a well-aimed knife
or death spell, the number of dead always rises. 

Motive: Magical power, mastery over death 

Environment: In places where dead are interred, usually with some number
of undead servitors 

Health: 15 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Speed defense as level 6 due to shroud of undead
protective spirits 

Combat: Necromancers can blast a foe within long range with the cold of
the grave or flesh-decaying magic. 

A necromancer can cast a death spell on a foe within short range once
every minute; the victim must succeed on a Might defense roll or move
down one step on the damage track. This ability could be an innate power
or come from an artifact. 

A necromancer who isn’t already accompanied by undead spirits or
shambling, spirit-inhabited corpses under their command can call up a
spirit as an action. A necromancer can command up to five spirits (or
newly allied undead, as described below) at a time. 

A necromancer can attempt to take command of a spirit or undead creature
within short range. They automatically succeed against an unaligned
undead target of level 4 or less. If a targeted spirit is already allied
with or in service to a PC, the PC must succeed on an Intellect defense
roll or lose control of the spirit to the necromancer’s will for one
minute. 

Spirit: level 3; flesh-decaying touch inflicts 3 points of damage

Interaction: Necromancers are feared for their nonchalant attitudes
toward life, especially the life of normal people (such as peasants and
city folk). They will negotiate but usually don’t have the capacity to
care about another person’s well-being; they’re sociopathic. 

Use: A character has died, and their allies must find a necromancer to
help retrieve their spirit. Of course, the necromancer wants something
in return for this aid—perhaps an artifact pilfered from whatever
underworld or hell the dead character is imprisoned within. 

Loot: Necromancers have one or two expensive items, a cypher, and
possibly an artifact.

GM intrusion: A bony hand erupts from the ground at the character’s
feet. On a failed Speed defense roll, they are held in place until they
can succeed on a Might task to escape. Each round the character fails to
escape, the hand squeezes them for 3 points of damage.

NOBLE KNIGHT 7 (21)

Whether noble or ignoble, some knights achieve an amazing mastery over
weapons, combat, and courtly graces, eclipsing lesser warriors and
champions. The quests of some noble knights can lead them far across the
land into strange new territories where they encounter and defeat
various magical creatures. 

Motive: Accomplish noble (or ignoble) deeds 

Environment: Almost anywhere, often alone, sometimes with followers 

Health: 50 

Damage Inflicted: 10 points 

Armor: 3 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: All tasks related to heraldic lore and chivalry as level
8; Speed defense as level 8 while holding shield 

Combat: Noble knights are armed with massive weapons they can wield in
one hand, which means they can also hold a shield. They are skilled with
melee weapons (such as a battleaxe, broadsword, or mace) and inflict
lethal damage on a hit. 

Noble knights can also rely on a magic artifact or two to aid them, and
possibly a noble steed (Noble steed: level 5; moves a long distance each
round). The artifact might be the very weapon a knight wields in combat
and could grant them one or more of the following additional abilities: 

Legendary Strength. The noble knight can call upon the artifact to grant
them great strength or fortitude to accomplish a particular physical
task (such as breaking down a door, lifting a boulder, or knocking down
pillars holding up a structure), which they attempt as if they were
level 10. 

Regeneration. The noble knight regenerates 2 points of health per round
while the weapon is drawn. 

Resistance. The noble knight is immune to effects that would influence
their mind, charm them, or put them to sleep. 

Interaction: Flowery language and impeccable manners show a knight’s
noble background. Those who negotiate with one in good faith are likely
to come away with something of value. However, sometimes a noble knight
is corrupt and betrays trusts. 

Use: A noble knight has decided that they must guard a bridge against
any who would cross it. 

Loot: Noble knights carry weapons, heavy armor, and perhaps a cypher or
even an artifact.

GM intrusion: The character damaged by a noble knight’s attack must
succeed on a Might defense roll or be knocked off a mount, a bridge, or
a cliff, or, if nothing suffices, they are knocked to the ground and out
of immediate range of the knight.

NUPPEPPO 2 (6)

Nuppeppos are animated lumps of human flesh that walk on vaguely defined
limbs. They smell of decay and death. They’re spotted in graveyards,
battlefields, coroner’s offices, and other places where the dead are
kept or interred. When witnessed in other places, nuppeppos seem to
wander streets aimlessly, sometimes alone, sometimes in groups, and
sometimes following a living person who’d rather be left alone.

Information about these creatures is scarce. They might be the
unintended consequence of a reanimation attempt, one that’s able to
catalyze its animation in similarly dead tissue to form more nuppeppos.
On the other hand, they could be particularly gruesome spirits of the
dead.

A nuppeppo sometimes follows a living individual around like a silent,
smelly pet that shows no affection. No one knows why.

(If a nuppeppo begins to follow a character, interaction tasks by that
character and their allies are hindered. Most other creatures are put
off by a lump of animate human flesh hanging around nearby.)

Motive: Wander, graze on dead flesh

Environment: Near places of death at night, alone or in groups of up to
eight

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short

Combat: A nuppeppo can smash a foe with one of its lumpy limbs. If a
nuppeppo is touched or struck in melee, the attacker’s weapon (or hand)
becomes stuck to the nuppeppo and can be pulled free only with a
difficulty 5 Might roll.

A victim of a nuppeppo’s attack (or someone who touches a nuppeppo)
begins to decay at a rate of 1 point of Speed damage (ignores Armor) per
round, starting in the round following contact. To stop the spread of
the decay, the victim can cut off the layer of affected flesh, which
deals 4 points of damage (ignores Armor).

Interaction: If approached, a nuppeppo turns to “face” its interlocutor,
but it doesn’t respond to questions or orders. However, it may begin to
follow its interlocutor from that point forward unless physically
prevented—at which point the nuppeppo becomes violent.

Use: The PCs open a grave, a coffin, or a sealed research lab, and
several nuppeppos spill out. Unless stopped, the creatures attempt to
“adopt” their discoverers.

GM intrusion: The character who allowed the nuppeppo to follow them
around like a pet (or who has been unable to prevent it) wakes to find
that the creature has settled upon them in the night and is using its
touch-decay abilities to feed. In fact, the character might already be
incapacitated by the time they wake.

OGRE 4 (12)

A bestial brute, the ogre is a sadistic, 8-foot (2 m) tall,
cannibalistic fiend that preys upon other creatures in the woods,
mountains, or other wilderness areas. This often pits them against
sylvan beings like elves and fey. Ogres dwelling in more civilized lands
are also the enemy of humans, but these ogres usually come no closer to
civilization than its very fringes.

Ogres typically dress in ragged, piecemeal clothing or nothing at all.

Motive: Hungers for flesh, sadistic

Environment: Anywhere, usually alone or (rarely) in a band of three or
four

Health: 20

Damage Inflicted: 8 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short

Modifications: Feats of raw strength as level 6; Intellect defense and
seeing through deception as level 3; Speed defense as level 3 due to
size

Combat: Ogres usually use clubs or large, two-handed weapons with great
power. Since they are accustomed to fighting smaller creatures, they are
adept at using their size and strength to their advantage. If an ogre
strikes a foe smaller than itself, either the victim is knocked back up
to 5 feet (1.5 m), or it is dazed, which hinders its next action.

Ogres can also swing their huge weapons in wide arcs, attacking all foes
within close range. Defending against this attack is hindered and the
attack inflicts 5 points of damage.

Ogres rarely flee from a fight, and only a foe of overwhelming power can
force them to surrender.

Interaction: Ogres are stupid and cruel. They speak whatever language is
most common in the area in which they live, but their vocabulary is
extremely limited. They don’t like conversation, even with their own
kind. Reasoning with them is difficult at best, but sometimes they can
be fooled.

Use: A solitary ogre is an excellent encounter for a group of first-tier
characters. A number of ogres, particularly well-equipped and
well-trained warriors, make excellent troops or guards in the service of
a powerful master. Evil wizards and warlords like to enslave ogres and
place them at the forefront of their armies. In these cases, the ogres
are typically bribed, ensorcelled, or intimidated by great force.

Loot: Some ogres hoard gold or other valuables in their lairs, but they
rarely have use for magic or cyphers.

GM intrusion: The ogre’s mighty blow (whether it strikes a foe or not)
hits the ground or the wall, causing major structural damage and a
possible collapse, cave-in, or landslide. It might also expose a hidden
underground cave or chamber.

ORC 2 (6)

Born into squalor and fear, the orc species is composed of miserable,
misbegotten humanoids that seem destined to serve as fodder for more
powerful evil overlords. When left to their own devices, these loathsome
creatures turn on each other, the strongest oppressing the next weakest
(and so on down the line) with cruel barbs, gruesome jokes, and physical
beatings. When these creatures have no masters to hate, they hate
themselves.

No two orcs look exactly alike, but all have a mean, ugly, and shambolic
facade. Never clean and often spattered with the remains of recent
meals, orcs have a mouthful of sharp, broken teeth that can develop into
true fangs. Adults range in height from no larger than a human child to
massive specimens larger than a strapping man. Whether big or small,
nearly all orcs have stooped backs and crooked legs. The hue of their
skin is hard to ascertain, because they are covered by the sediment of
years, not to mention the iron armor every orc constantly wears from the
moment it’s able to lift a weapon.

Motive: Make others more miserable than itself

Environment: Anywhere near, on, or under mountains, usually in groups of
four to six, or in tribes dozens to hundreds strong

Health: 7

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Armor: 2

Movement: Short

Modifications: Speed defense as level 3 when carrying a shield; pleasant
interactions as level 1

Combat: Most orcs have bows able to target foes within long range. Some
carry a shield and wield a medium axe, sword, or mace that inflicts 4
points of damage. Other orcs (usually those that are larger than their
fellows) dispense with shields and wield heavy two-handed mauls and
hammers that inflict 6 points of damage.

Orcs live short, brutish lives. The few that survive for years do so
because of some special advantage; they’re sneakier, stronger, tougher,
or meaner than average. These have the following modifications,
respectively:

\* Stealth tasks as level 5

\* Deal 2 additional points of damage with melee weapons

\* +10 health

\* Tasks related to trickery and deceit as level 5

Interaction: An orc would stab its own mother if it thought doing so
would give it another hour of life in a desperate situation. That said,
most orcs have been conditioned, through beatings and torture, to fear
the evil master they serve (if any). Characters attempting to negotiate
with an orc through intimidation find that short-term success is
followed by medium-term betrayal.

Use: A band of orcs fires on the PCs from the edge of the forest.
However, these orcs are crafty, and characters who rush directly into
combat might fall victim to a hidden pit trap or other prepared ambush.

Loot: Orcs carry a lot of garbage. Amid this dross, a band of orcs might
have currency equivalent to a moderately priced item among them.

GM intrusion: With a scream of savage glee, five more orcs rush to join
the fight.

PRINCE(SS) OF SUMMER 5 (15)

Fey nobility are as numberless as cottonwood seeds on the June breeze.
But that doesn’t mean each isn’t unique, with a quirky personality and a
specific role to play in the mysterious Court of Summer. Demonstrating
life, vigor, predation, growth, and competition, the princesses and
princes of summer are beings of warmth and generosity, usually. But
catch them during the change of the season, and they can be deadly
adversaries just as easily. Fey nobles dress in costly diaphanous and
flowing garments, and often wear some sign of their noble lineage, such
as a circlet or diadem.

Motive: Unpredictable; defend fey territory and prerogatives

Environment: Almost any wilderness region alone or commanding a small
group of lesser faerie creatures

Health: 22

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Armor: 2

Movement: Short; short when gliding on the wind

Modifications: Tasks related to deception, disguise, courtly manners,
and positive interactions as level 7

Combat: Most fey princesses and princes are armed with an elegant sword
and possibly a bow carved of silverwood. Also, each knows one or more
faerie spells. Faerie spells include the following.

*Brilliant Smile:* Target must succeed on an Intellect defense task or
do the fey creature’s will for up to one minute.

*Golden Mead:* Allies who drink from the fey’s flask gain an asset to
all defense tasks for ten hours.

*Night’s Reward:* Target suffers 5 points of Intellect damage (ignores
Armor) and must make an Intellect defense roll or fall asleep for up to
one minute.

*Summer Confidence:* Selected targets in short range have an asset on
tasks related to resisting fear and acting boldly.

*Thorns:* Target suffers 5 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) and
must succeed on a Might defense task or lose their next turn entangled
in rapidly grown thorny vines.

Princes and princesses of summer regain 2 points of health per round
while their health is above 0 unless they’ve been damaged with a
silvered or cold iron weapon.

Interaction: Most fey are willing to talk, and those of the Summer Court
are especially eager to make deals. However, people who bargain with fey
nobles should take care to avoid being tricked.

Use: The characters find a fey noble wounded and in need of aid.

Loot: In addition to fine clothing, fine equipment, and a considerable
sum of currency, a prince or princess of summer might carry a few
cyphers and even a faerie artifact.

GM intrusion: The character is blinded for up to one minute by a shaft
of brilliant sunlight unless they succeed on a Might defense task.

PUPPET TREE 6 (18)

A puppet tree is a 25-foot (8 m) tall, spiky, orange and blue tree
surrounded by a large area of red reeds that tremble and wave enticingly
even when no wind is present. Humanoid figures are often gathered around
it, but these rotted, overgrown corpses are the tree’s victims, dead but
serving as fleshy puppets to the tree’s will.

Victims drained of knowledge and life are used as lures to draw in yet
more victims, at least until the bodies rot away. When not used as
lures, the corpse puppets are sent to scout nearby areas.

(Corpse puppet: level 2; struck targets must also succeed on a Might
defense task or be grabbed until they can escape; all tasks attempted by
the grabbed target are hindered; free-roaming puppets remain animate for
one day)

Motive: Hungers for fresh bodies

Environment: On hilltops, isolated from other plant life

Health: 33

Damage Inflicted: 8 points

Armor: 3

Movement: None

Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to size and immobility;
deception and disguise (puppeteering corpses to act in a lifelike
manner) as level 7

Combat: Some of the red reeds surrounding a puppet tree end in a hard,  
sharp crystal spike. When a living creature comes within short  
range of the tree, the reeds rise behind the target and try to skewer
them through the head or neck with the spike. If a target is killed by
these attacks, the puppet tree controls the body as a corpse puppet,
using it to enact its plans. Over time these humanoids rot and are
overgrown by the biology of the plant, losing utility for the tree. Most
trees have about five corpse puppets active, which can be simultaneously
animated to attack foes.

A puppet tree is vulnerable to fire. All fire attacks against the tree
inflict 2 additional points of damage and ignore Armor. The puppet tree
will always attempt to stop a fire, or target the source of flame during
combat.

A corpse puppet can be detached and sent roaming; however, it retains
only about a day’s worth of animation, after which it collapses and
molders like a normal corpse. Sometimes, however, a sapling puppet tree
blooms from the remains.

Interaction: Puppet trees are highly intelligent, but malevolent. Even
if communication can be opened via telepathy or some other means, the
tree will always attempt to double-cross the PCs.

Use: The PCs spy a group of “people” having a picnic under a
strange-looking tree in the middle of nowhere.

Loot: Possessions of former victims can be found in the red reeds,
usually including a moderate amount of currency and various bits of
gear. Devices of victims (if any) are collected by the corpse puppets
and cobbled together into a strange machine, its purpose inexplicable.

GM intrusion: Two corpse puppets, unseen in the red reeds, rise and
seize a character in an attempt to hold them still for a crystal spike
attack. The character must make a difficulty 4 Speed or Might task to
shake free.

RAVAGE BEAR 4 (12)

A ravage bear is a hideous predator that hunts entirely by sense of
smell. It is blind and nearly deaf, but it still tracks and senses prey
easily. It is very protective of its young, and if hungry, it is
extremely dangerous. Otherwise, it gives most creatures a wide berth.

Motive: Hungers for flesh

Environment: Alone or in pairs (usually with a few cubs) in wooded,
rocky, or mountainous areas, typically in cold or temperate climes

Health: 20

Damage Inflicted: 7 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Long

Modifications: Makes Might defense rolls as level 6; runs, climbs, and
jumps as level 7

Combat: A ravage bear grabs foes with its powerful arms, holds them
fast, and then squeezes and tears at them until they are dead. It can
hold only one creature at a time. While a ravage bear is holding a
creature, it can attack only the held creature. In each round that a
held creature does not escape, it suffers 4 points of damage in addition
to damage from attacks made against it.

A ravage bear can move very quickly in short sprints. In combat, it can
go into an insane fury and will fight to the death. If it takes 10 or
more points of damage, its defenses are hindered, but its attacks are
eased.

Ravage bears are immune to visual effects, such as illusions. However,
olfactory effects can confuse and “blind” them temporarily.

Interaction: Ravage bears are animals and act like animals.

Use: Ravage bears are likely chance encounters in the wilderness for
unlucky travelers.

GM intrusion: In its rage, the ravage bear makes an extra attack that
does 2 additional points of damage.

REPLICANT 5 (15)

Virtually identical to adult humans, these biosculpted androids are
stronger, faster, and potentially smarter. However, because they are
manufactured beings with grafted memories, replicants rarely feel true
human emotion, be that love, sadness, or empathy, though those who live
long enough to lay down their own memories can develop the capacity to
do so.

However, few replicants gain the opportunity because they are created
for a purpose, which could be to serve as police or guards, as soldiers
in a distant war, or as impostors shaped to blend in with people so they
can explore on behalf of an alien intelligence or a bootstrapped AI. In
most of these cases, these purposes lead to a relatively short span of
existence, which usually ends when the replicant chooses to detonate
itself rather than be captured.

Motive: Go unnoticed; stamp out (or replace) any who learn of their
existence

Environment: Anywhere

Health: 18

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Tasks related to pleasant social interaction,
understanding human social norms, and deception as level 2

Combat: Replicants blend in and prefer not to enter combat. Since
destruction is not usually their principal goal, they avoid
confrontation. If, however, something threatens their mission, they
defend themselves to the best of their ability. Replicants might use
weaponry but are adept in using their limbs to batter foes into
submission.

A replicant poses the greatest danger when its physical form begins to
fail through violence or natural degradation (many seem to have a
natural “life” span of just a few years). When reduced to 0 points of
health, the replicant explodes, inflicting 10 points of damage to
everything in long range.

Interaction: Replicants are designed to look human and, at least during
a casual interaction, pass as human. But extended conversation trips up
a replicant more often than not. Eventually, a replicant gets something
wrong and says inappropriate things or exhibits strange mannerisms.

Use: A contact of one of the characters is secretly a replicant. It has
survived longer than expected, and its connection to whatever created it
has weakened enough that it has gained some independence and made strong
emotional connections to the PC. It knows its time is running out and
may turn to the character for help.

GM intrusion: The character struck by the replicant is smashed into the
wall so hard that the surrounding structure begins to collapse on them.

SAPIENT TREE 3 (9)

Guardians of the wood, sapient trees stand eternally vigilant, often on
the outskirts of their grove or forest to keep out those who might seek
to do them—or other, ordinary trees— harm. They look like normal trees
until they reveal their true nature, with limb-like branches and faces
in the bark of their trunk. They don’t always move, but with effort,
they can uproot themselves and walk about. However, they usually do so
only when no one is looking. The origin and temperament of sapient trees
varies; they might be haunted trees possessed by spirits, trees animated
by magic spells, or ancient mythical beings. Some are peaceful and
noble, but others are downright wicked and cruel. 

Motive: Defense 

Environment: Found in groves or copses of five to twenty 

Health: 16 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Armor: 3 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Initiative as level 4; Speed defense as level 2 due to
size 

Combat: When a sapient tree attacks, it often does so with surprise
because it looks like a normal tree at first. If a character about to be
attacked fails an Intellect defense roll, they do not perceive the
attack in time, and the tree’s attack is eased. 

If a tree strikes in combat with one of its branch-arms, it can choose
to grab the foe (rather than inflict damage) and toss them an immediate
distance away, inflicting 2 points of ambient damage if they hit the
ground or another solid object. If they are tossed at another creature,
that second creature must make a successful Speed defense roll or also
take this damage. 

Sometimes, a sapient tree that bears fruit will hurl its fruit up to
short range, inflicting 4 points of damage. 

Interaction: Sapient trees are generally unfriendly and indignant toward
animal life. They are fearful and assume that any creature not native to
their forest is a threat. They are likely to attack first rather than
speak, although they can speak eloquently, if sometimes slowly. 

Use: These trees populate magic forests. They can be used to surprise
characters with an attack from an unexpected direction.

GM intrusion: The tree grabs the character and holds them fast, shaking
them. They take 4 points of damage each round and can do nothing but
attempt to escape (the task is hindered by two steps because of the
shaking).

SATYR 5 (15)

These muscular humanoids sport long curved horns and furry, hooved legs.
They are self-centered, greedy, and sybaritic creatures, dedicated to
food, drink, and other pleasures. They rob and steal from others as it
pleases them, often relying on tricks and lies, or alluring music they
play on pipes. 

Motive: Play tricks, gather treasure, fulfill desires 

Environment: Woodlands, hills, and plains 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short Modifications: Tasks related to persuasion and deception
as level 7; resists mental attacks as level 7 

Combat: Satyrs usually carry spears that they can use in melee and
against foes within short range. They can also create magical effects by
playing their pipes as an action, which can either bolster allies or
harm enemies: 

Dance of the Leaping Stag: Foes within short range who fail an Intellect
defense task lose their next turn to dancing and leaping. Attacks made
against affected targets are eased. 

Feral Overture: An ally within short range is infused with magic, and
one attack it makes on its next turn is eased; if it hits, it inflicts
+3 damage.  
Tune of the Clouded Mind: A foe within short range who fails an
Intellect defense task spends its next turn attacking one of its
allies. 

Interaction: Satyrs are inveterate mercenaries. They gladly work for
strong drink and other treasures, and they ally with almost any creature
capable of meeting their price. A satyr is always willing to start
negotiations, but is prone to lying and exaggeration. Offering excessive
libation, food, and other rewards is the only way to ensure that a satyr
remains honest, and then for only a short period. 

Use: Strange piping music in the forest lures away young people from a
nearby community. Community elders say a charismatic cult leader has set
up in the woods and clouds the minds of all who come near. 

Loot: A satyr is likely to carry one or two cyphers.

GM intrusion: A mental effect makes the character view the satyr as a
good friend for up to one minute unless they succeed at an Intellect
defense task.

SHADOW 1 (3)

Shadows are semi-intelligent patches of darkness roughly in the shape of
a humanoid creature’s silhouette. They creep along walls, floors, and
ceilings, blending in with actual shadows, peeling themselves free only
when they’re ready to clutch at a victim with their cold claws. 

Motive: Hunger for life energy 

Environment: Anywhere that shadows can occur 

Health: 3 

Damage Inflicted: 2 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Stealth as level 3 

Combat: Shadows attack with their claws, which feel like a cold breeze
and drain 2 points of Might from their target with each hit. They can
barely interact with physical objects, and even something as simple as
moving a pebble an immediate distance or knocking over a candle takes
intense concentration. 

A group of five shadows can act as a swarm, focusing on one target to
make one attack as a single level 3 creature, inflicting 4 points of
damage. In an area of complete darkness with no illumination at all,
shadows are effectively powerless—they cannot attack and all their
actions are hindered. If suddenly deprived of light, they slink about
menacingly for a few minutes but lose interest if it seems like their
prey won’t be bringing back the light. 

Shadows are flat rather than insubstantial, but attacks that harm
phased, ghostly, or similar creatures are fully effective against them.
They can easily pass through narrow spaces such as the gap under a door
or between the bars of a cell, but cannot move through solid objects. 

Interaction: Shadows never speak, but they can make rustling noises like
a gently moving curtain. If controlled or prevented from attacking, they
can communicate with simple pantomimes and seem to understand some
pieces of language. 

Use: The flickering shadows from a campfire bend strangely and begin to
creep toward a nearby character. A person appears to have two shadows
just before they feel icy coldness slide along their flesh.

GM intrusion: The shadow attaches itself to a character and begins to
take over as their shadow, automatically inflicting damage every round
until the character uses an action to tear it off of them.

SHADOW ELF 4 (12)

Elves who faded from the surface to escape the justice of their fey
cousins for crimes uncounted are sometimes called shadow elves, dark
elves, or simply trow. It’s widely assumed that shadow elves fled to new
realms deep below the ground, and indeed, the routes that lead to their
true abodes are mostly subterranean and include many grand underground
keeps. However, the heart of the shadow elf kingdom lies in the
colorless dimension of Shadow itself, where all things exist as a dim
reflection of the real world.

Sometimes shadow elves appear on the surface, spilling from dark tunnels
or, in some cases, from the shadows themselves. They raid for plunder,
fresh slaves, and sacrifices. The sacrifices are made to their godqueen,
a monstrously sized black widow spider that schemes in darkness.

When a shadow elf returns to the world of light, it can choose to appear
as a silhouette only: a slender humanoid outline lurking as if at the
nadir of a well.

Motive: Tortures for pleasure, serve the shadow elf godqueen

Environment: Almost anywhere dimly lit, singly or in groups of up to
four

Health: 15

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short

Modifications: Stealth and perception as level 6; Speed defense as level
6 due to shadowy nature

Combat: Shadow elves attack with short blades, knives, and crossbow
quarrels of steel-hard shadow. They can see in dim light and absolute
darkness as if it were daylight.

Some shadow elves can cast spells, including the following. Each spell
requires an action to cast.

If subject to full daylight, a shadow elf loses its modifications to
stealth, perception, and Speed defense, and is likely to retreat.

Interaction: Shadow elves may negotiate and even ally with other
creatures for a time. But they do so only until the best opportunity for
a betrayal presents itself.

Use: Shadow elves have overrun an outlying keep, and even in broad
daylight, the castle is shrouded in darkness and webs of shadow. The
treasures said to lie in the keep’s coffers may already be in the hands
of the dark fey.

Loot: A shadow elf carries currency equivalent to an expensive item, in
addition to weapons, light armor, and a cypher or two. Shadow elf
leaders may carry an artifact.

GM intrusion: The shadow elf casts a spell that charms a character on a
failed Intellect defense roll. The character fights on the side of the
shadow elf for up to one minute, though they can make another Intellect
defense roll each round to try to break the influence.

SKELETON 2 (6)

Skeletons are animated bones without much sense of self-preservation.
They enjoy a crucial advantage over living creatures in one important
and often exploited area: skeletons are dead shots with ranged weapons.
They have no breath, no heartbeat, and no shaking hands to contend with
as they release a shot, which means that skeletons armed with ranged
weapons are something to be feared.

Motive: Defense or offense

Environment: Nearly anywhere, in formations of four to ten

Health: 6

Damage Inflicted: 3 points (claw) or 5 points (ranged weapon)

Armor: 1

Movement: Short

Modifications: Ranged attacks as level 5; Speed defense against most
ranged attacks as level 5; resist trickery as level 1

Combat: Skeletons can attack with a bony claw if they have no other
weapon, but most attack with a long-range weapon. If a skeleton can see
any portion of its target, the target loses any benefits of cover it
might have otherwise enjoyed.

When in formation, a group of four or more skeletons with ranged weapons
can focus their attacks on one target and make one attack roll as a
single level 7 creature, dealing 7 points of damage.

Skeletons can see in the dark.

*Reanimators:* Some skeletons were created by a curse, and simply
battering them into a pile of bones isn’t enough to end their existence.
Two rounds after reanimator skeletons are “killed,” they regain full
health in a flash of magical illumination. This regeneration can be
prevented if the linchpin of the animating curse is separated from the
skeleton after it falls. Such an item is usually obvious and might take
the form of a lead spike through the skull, an ebony amulet, a dull
sword through the ribs, a crown, and so on.

Interaction: A skeleton usually interacts only by attacking. Unless
animated by a sapient spirit able to communicate via magic, skeletons
lack the mechanisms for speech. However, they can hear and see the world
around them just fine.

Use: Skeletons make ideal units in armies, especially when archery or
artillery is required. A formation of four or more skeletons with ranged
weapons atop a tower provides a surprisingly robust defense.

Loot: Sometimes the linchpin item required to create a reanimator
skeleton is valuable.

GM intrusion: A skeleton destroyed by a melee attack explodes like a
grenade. The bone shrapnel inflicts 5 points of damage to every creature
in immediate range.

SOUL EATER 5 (15)

A soul eater is the animate head of a powerful wizard who shuffled off
this mortal coil to become an undead creature without ethics, feelings,
or a sense of morality. Also called dread skulls, these creatures
maintain their existence by occasionally absorbing the spirit or mind of
living victims. An absorbed “soul” is burned away, which is why dread
skulls are wreathed in flame; it’s the by-product of the creature’s
previous meal. 

Motive: Hungers for souls 

Environment: Usually at the center of tombs 

Health: 15 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Long when flying 

Modifications: Resists mental attacks and deception as level 7; Speed
defense as level 7 due to size and quickness; knowledge of arcane
methodologies and rituals as level 8 

Combat: A soul eater has a library of magic abilities it can draw upon,
including long-range attacks of fire or cold against all targets within
immediate range of each other, the ability to read the mind of a victim
within short range on a failed Intellect defense roll, and the ability
to cloak itself in the illusion of a normal human for up to an hour at a
time. 

In addition, a dread skull can draw out a victim’s consciousness and
absorb it in a blaze of supernatural fire. To do so, the creature must
bite a target, which inflicts 5 points of damage; the target must then
succeed on an Intellect defense roll or take an additional 5 points of
Intellect damage (ignores Armor). 

If a dread skull drains a character’s Intellect Pool to 0 through
repeated bites, the character’s soul is sucked into the skull, and the
body falls limp. Once absorbed into the skull, a victim’s essence is
trapped and slowly consumed over the next twenty-four hours. During this
period, the skull regenerates 1 point of health per round. 

If a dread skull isn’t destroyed within twenty-four hours of eating a
soul, the victim’s essence is fully consumed. If the soul eater is
defeated and its skull is shattered before then, all unconsumed souls
are returned to their bodies. 

Interaction: Dread skulls are slightly insane but hellishly smart, which
means that sometimes they will negotiate to get what they want. 

Use: Soul eaters remember a little bit of the knowledge of every
creature’s essence they consume. The PCs need to learn the command word
of an artifact they’ve found, but the only one who knew it was consumed
by a dread skull. 

Loot: Sometimes dread skulls keep treasures as trophies of past
victories, consisting of 1d6 cyphers and maybe an artifact.

GM intrusion: The character who uses a cypher against the dread skull
must make an Intellect defense roll. On a failed roll, the cypher begins
to burn with flame, dealing the character 5 points of damage and
destroying the cypher in the process.

SPHINX 7 (21)

A sphinx is a magical creature with a large lionlike body, feathered
wings, and a head that is like that of a human or some kind of animal
(typically a hawk or ram). Wise and fierce, sphinxes have a connection
to the divine and are often found guarding temples or persons of great
interest to the gods (although whether they serve good or evil depends
on the individual sphinx). No matter what their head looks like, a
sphinx can devour creatures as easily and quickly as a lion. 

Motive: Defense, riddles 

Environment: Deserts, plains, and mountains 

Health: 25 

Damage Inflicted: 7 points 

Armor: 2 

Movement: Short; long when flying 

Modifications: Intellect defense and magical lore as level 8 

Combat: A sphinx attacks with its lion claws, making two swipes as its
action. A sphinx also has the following magical abilities: 

• Curse: Curse a creature within long range, hindering all their
physical actions by two steps until some other magic lifts the curse. 

• Heal: Restore 10 health to an NPC, or allow a PC to use their next
action to make a recovery roll that does not count toward their normal
allotment. Can be used three times per day. 

• Riddle: A creature within long range must make an Intellect defense
roll to answer a difficult riddle; failure means the creature stands
confused for one minute even if they are attacked. 

• Spellbreaker: End an ongoing magical effect within short range, such
as a curse or protective spell. If there are multiple effects, the
sphinx chooses which one to end. It can target an immediate area instead
of a specific effect (such as an area where it suspects an invisible
enemy is hiding). 

• Teleport: Instantaneously move a very long distance. Can be used once
per day. 

Interaction: Sphinxes are very intelligent and speak several languages
(including at least one ancient or obscure language). If their demands
are met (such as by answering a riddle or performing a service), they
can be quite talkative, if arrogant. 

Use: A sphinx guards the main road into the city, killing anyone who
fails to answer its riddle. A sphinx approaches, offering secret lore if
the characters can direct it to a suitable mate or an abandoned temple
it can restore and guard. 

Loot: A sphinx usually has one or two cyphers and perhaps a small
artifact it can wear and use.

GM intrusion: The sphinx leaps onto its opponent, attacking with all
four claws as its action.

STATUE, ANIMATE 7 (21)

Towering statues carved from stone or cast in metal are sometimes more
than humans rendered in moments of triumph, celebration, or suffering.
Sometimes a statue moves, usually in service to some ancient geas or
command that animated it in the first place.

Most animate statues are vessels imprisoning the mind of a sentient
creature. Such entrapment usually tumbles the spirits into the abyss of
insanity, though most rest in a dormant state, their minds lost in
whatever memories they retain. Disturbing animate statues can cause them
to awaken, usually with disastrous results.

Motive: Release from imprisonment; guard an area

Environment: In out-of-the-way places, especially ancient ruins

Health: 33

Damage Inflicted: 9 points

Armor: 4

Movement: Short

Modifications: All tasks involving balance as level 2; Might defense as
level 8; Speed defense as level 5 due to size

Combat: An animate statue towers over most foes, and it can smash or
stomp a target within short range as a melee attack. The statue’s
massive size and the material of its body means it can walk through
nearly any obstacle, smashing through walls of solid rock, buildings,
and trees. When walking, it pays no attention to what it steps on.
Anything in its path is likely flattened. A character who is stepped on
must make a Speed defense roll to dodge or be knocked down and take 9
points of damage.

Animate statues are strong and hard to hurt, but they are often
top-heavy. If one falls or is knocked over, it takes a few rounds to
rise and resume whatever it was doing.

Interaction: Statues spend years immobilized and insensate, their minds
lost in half-remembered experiences and hallucinations. Rousing a statue
has unpredictable results. Some might rampage. Others laugh, cry, or
scream streams of nonsense. Regardless, if one has been commanded to
guard an area or entrance, it also likely lashes out.

Use: An animate statue holds a treasure trove of knowledge. If the
characters can keep it focused or knocked down long enough, they might
coax from it the information they seek.

GM intrusion: The animate statue strikes a character so hard that the
victim flies a long distance and lands in a heap, possibly dropping gear
and weapons along the way.

TROLL 6 (18)

A troll is a hideous humanoid standing at least 10 feet (3 m) tall that
hunts more by smell than by sight. They are dangerous but not
particularly intelligent. Always ravenous, trolls eat anything, and
rarely take the time to cook a meal. Usually, they distend their mouths
and throats and swallow subdued prey whole. 

Motive: Hungers for flesh 

Environment: Nearly anywhere, hunting alone or in pairs 

Health: 30 

Damage Inflicted: 7 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Long 

Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to size; Might defense as
level 7; sees through deception as level 4 

Combat: The troll attacks with its claws. If it hits, it grabs a foe
tightly, then squeezes and bites until the victim is dead or it releases
that victim to attack another creature. Each round that a held creature
does not escape, they take 10 points of damage. 

Trolls regain 3 points of health per round. If a troll suffers a
particularly egregious wound (10 or more points of damage in one round),
rather than regain health in that round (and instead of taking any other
action), the troll divides into two level 4 trolls that are 3 feet (1 m)
tall. Spawned trolls that survive the battle and have access to food
grow into full-power trolls within a few weeks. 

Interaction: Trolls speak their own simple language, but a few know a
little bit of a local human language. Most prefer to attack and eat
other creatures, but might be bargained with after a successful show of
force. 

Spawned troll: level 4, Might defense as level 5; health 15; Armor 1;
claws inflict 5 points of damage; grabbed victim suffers 5 points of
damage each round held by troll

Use: Trolls may be chance encounters in the wilderness for unlucky
travelers. Sometimes captured trolls are used by slavers, armies, and
powerful wizards as guards and warriors.

GM intrusion: The struck troll divides into two separate trolls that
immediately attack the character in the same action.

TYRANNOSAURUS REX 7 (21)

The short arms of a tyrannosaurus have been much parodied in Earth
social media circles, but the arms aren’t really important when a
hunting tyrannosaurus is after you. It’s more the soul-shivering roar,
designed to freeze prey in place, and a skull and mouth so enormous that
the entire creature is cantilevered by a massive tail that itself can be
used as a powerful weapon.

As vicious as tyrannosauruses likely were 66 million years ago, the
versions still hunting today could be even more dangerous. That’s
because the ones with a taste for humans have learned to adapt to human
defenses and to use their roar to terrorize prey as they hunt.

Motive: Hungers for flesh

Environment: Tyrannosauruses hunt solo or in pairs; they’re drawn to
loud, unfamiliar noises (like motor engines).

Health: 50

Damage Inflicted: 10 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Perception as level 5; Speed defense as level 5 due to
size

Combat: A tyrannosaurus attacks with its massive bite. Not only does it
deal damage, but the target must also make a Might defense roll to pull
free or be shaken like a rat in the mouth of a pit bull for 3 additional
points of Speed damage (ignores Armor). The shaking recurs each
subsequent round in which the target fails a Might-based task to pull
free.

A tyrannosaurus can also make a trampling attack if it can charge from
just outside of short range. When it does, it moves 50 feet (15 m) in a
round, and anything that comes within immediate range is attacked. Even
those who make a successful Speed defense roll take 2 points of damage.

Finally, a tyrannosaurus can roar. The first time creatures within short
range hear the roar on any given day, they must succeed on a difficulty
2 Intellect defense roll or stand frozen in fear for a round. Attacks
against them are eased by two steps in the attacker’s favor and deal 2
additional points of damage.

For all their power, tyrannosauruses are not above self-preservation.
They never fight to the death if they are outclassed, and they usually
break off if they take more than 30 points of damage in a conflict.

Interaction: Tyrannosauruses are animals, but they’re clever hunters,
too. When they hunt in pairs, they work to keep prey penned between
them.

Use: Something is killing big game in a forest preserve. Poachers are
suspected at first, but when they are also found dead, it’s clear that
something else is to blame.

GM intrusion: The tyrannosaurus’s tail swings around and knocks the
character tumbling out of short range and possibly into dangerous
terrain.

VAMPIRE 6 (18)

Vampires are undead creatures, risen from the grave to drink blood.
Their very nature and essence are evil and anti-life, even as they revel
in their own endless existence. Most vampires are vain, arrogant,
sadistic, lustful, and domineering. Their powers allow them to
manipulate others, and they frequently toy with their prey before
feeding. Vampires come out only at night, as the sun’s rays will destroy
them.

The bite of a vampire over three nights (in which it exchanges a bit of
its own blood) ensures that the victim will rise as a vampire under the
thrall of the one that killed it. While vampires are careful not to
create too many of their kind (which amount to competition), each thrall
conveys a bit more supernatural power to a vampire.

Motive: Thirsts for blood

Environment: Usually solitary, on the edges of civilization

Health: 24

Damage Inflicted: 7 points

Movement: Long

Modifications: Climb, stealth, and perception as level 8; Speed defense
as level 7 due to fast movement

Combat: Vampires are strong and fast. They have impressive fangs, but
these are usually used in feeding, not in battle. They typically fight
with their fists or hands (which basically become claws) but sometimes
use weapons.

A vampire can change into a bat or a wolf. This transformation does not
change its stats or abilities except that, as a bat, it can fly.
Vampires can also transform into shadow or mist, and in these forms they
can’t be harmed by anything (but also can’t affect the physical world).

Vampires possess an unholy charisma and can mesmerize victims within
immediate distance so that they stand motionless for one round. In
subsequent rounds, the victim will not forcibly resist the vampire, and
the vampire can suggest actions to the victim (even actions that will
cause the victim to harm themselves or others they care about). Each
round, the victim can attempt a new Intellect defense roll to break
free.

Vampires are notoriously difficult to hurt. Unless a weapon is very
special (blessed by a saint, has specific magical enchantments against
vampires, or the like), no physical attack harms a vampire. They simply
don’t take the damage. Exceptions include the following:

*Fire:* Vampires burn, though the damage doesn’t kill them. It only
causes pain, and a vampire regains all health lost to fire damage within
a day.

*Running water:* Complete immersion inflicts 10 points of damage per
round. If not destroyed, the vampire can use a single action to regain
all health lost in this way.

*Holy water:* This inflicts 4 points of damage and affects a vampire
exactly like fire.

*Sunlight:* Exposure to sunlight inflicts 10 points of damage per round.
If not destroyed, the vampire regains all health lost to exposure within
a day.

*Wooden stake:* This weapon inflicts 25 points of damage, effectively
destroying the vampire in one blow. However, if the vampire is aware and
able to move, this attack is hindered as the vampire does everything it
can to evade.

Further, vampires have the following special weaknesses:

*Garlic:* Significant amounts of garlic within immediate distance hinder
a vampire’s tasks.

*Cross, holy symbol, or mirror:* Presenting any of these objects
forcefully stuns a vampire, causing it to lose its next action. While
the object is brandished and the vampire is within immediate range, its
tasks are hindered by two steps.

Eventually, a vampire with a multitude under its command becomes the new
vampire lord. The vampire lord is the most powerful vampire in the world
and is often (but not always) the most ancient of its kind. It has many
vampires under its control, and even those that it did not create pay it
respect and homage.

Interaction: Most vampires look upon humans as cattle upon which to
feed. They rarely have respect for anything but other vampires, and they
often hate other supernatural creatures that they cannot enslave.

Use: Strange stories of shadows in the night, people disappearing from
their beds, and graves missing their former occupants could portend the
arrival of a vampire in the region.

GM intrusion: The character struck by the vampire is caught fast in its
powerful grip. If the character doesn’t escape immediately, the vampire
bites them automatically.

VAMPIRE, TRANSITIONAL 3 (9)

When humans are “visited upon” (bitten) by a vampire, they might be
killed, or they might be left alive to begin a slow transformation into
a creature of the night. If victims are bitten three times, they become
a vampire forever under the control of the one that bit them. From the
time of the first bite until their complete transformation after the
third bite, they are transitional vampires. Ways to return transitional
vampires to normal include using special ancient rituals or destroying
the vampire that bit them in the first place.

Transitional vampires usually serve as guardians, consorts, or spies for
their masters.

Motive: Thirsts for blood

Environment: Anywhere, usually solitary but sometimes in groups of two
or three

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Climb and stealth as level 4

Combat: Transitional vampires can maintain a human existence during the
day without any of a vampire’s powers or weaknesses. However, they have
a disdain for garlic and the sun. At night they take on all the
characteristics of a vampire, and if confronted by any of the
traditional vampiric weaknesses (a wooden stake, a cross, and so on),
they flee unless their master is present.

Interaction: Transitional vampires are utterly devoted to their master.

Use: Transitional vampires lie in the intersection of foe and victim. A
loved one or trusted companion who has been turned into a transitional
vampire will try to betray, defeat, and kill the PCs, but the characters
are motivated to save them rather than destroy them.

VAT REJECT 3 (9)

Vat rejects come into being when clone vats meant to produce clone
soldiers or similar  
mass-produced entities are corrupted. How the carefully controlled
process becomes compromised varies, but possibilities include yeast
contamination, sunspot activity, nanovirus evolution, or purposeful
meddling with control parameters. Unskilled operators experimenting with
derelict cloning equipment can also produce a vat of rejects.

Vat rejects fear nothing and welcome death, except that their
existential rage requires an outlet other than immediate suicide. Their
warped forms mean that most are in constant pain, and they somehow
understand that this was artificially stamped into them by their
creators. Revenge is their only possible redemption.

Motive: Self-destruction through endless aggression

Environment: Anywhere in lost and lonely places

Health: 9

Damage Inflicted: 3 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Speed defense as level 4 due to frenzied alacrity

Combat: Vat rejects charge into battle with berserk speed, hindering
defenses against their initial attack. All vat rejects are able to
inflict damage directly by cutting, bashing, or biting a victim,
depending on their particular morphology. Some also have additional
abilities; roll on the table below for each reject.

inflicting 6 points of damage in a<br />
radioactive explosion (and 1 point even<br />
on a successful Speed defense roll)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Interaction: Vat rejects are usually always enraged, making interaction
nearly impossible. However, some may negotiate if offered a reasonable
hope of salvation through extreme surgery or other transformation.

Use: A long-missing derelict ship, famous for carrying a load of
planet-buster superweapons, is found. However, salvagers discover it to
be overrun by vat rejects. No one knows if the rejects plan to use the
superweapons, if they have been released by someone else as a
distraction, or if they are part of a mutated ship defense system.

GM intrusion: The vat reject also has a radioactive sting. On a failed
Might defense roll, the character struck by the reject descends one step
on the damage track.

WARDROID 6 (18)

When star troopers need heavy support, they sometimes bring in
wardroids. These fearsome robots, standing about 8 feet (2 m) tall, are
ruthless even by trooper standards and are known to kill innocent
bystanders as often as they kill foes. It is said that when wardroids
are unleashed, wise troopers fall back and take cover.

Motive: Maintain control, crush, kill, destroy

Environment: Anywhere

Health: 30

Damage Inflicted: 8 points

Armor: 3

Movement: Short; some models can fly a short distance each round

Modifications: Attacks as level 7

Combat: A wardroid’s main weapon is a bank of laser blasters that it can
use to attack up to three foes standing next to each other as one
action. When damaged, a wardroid regains 1 point of health each round.
Furthermore, each wardroid has one additional capability:

</tbody>
</table>

Interaction: Interaction is difficult for those not authorized to
communicate with a wardroid.

Use: Wardroids are often deployed in groups of two or three to guard a
vault or the entrance to a spacecraft, or to track down intruders aboard
a space station.

Loot: The remains of a wardroid can yield one or two cyphers to someone
adept at salvage.

GM intrusion: When defeated, the wardroid detonates, inflicting 8 points
of damage on all creatures within immediate range.

WEREWOLF 4 (12)

The curse of lycanthropy begins as nightmares about being chased or,
somehow more terrifying, chasing someone else. As the dreams grow more
fierce and each night’s sleep provides less rest, victims begin to
wonder about the bloodstains on their clothing, the strange claw marks
in their homes, and eventually, the mutilated bodies they find buried in
their backyards.

When not transformed, many who suffer the curse seem like completely
normal people, if emotionally traumatized by the fact that most of their
friends and family have been brutally slaughtered over the preceding
months. Some few, however, realize the truth of their condition, and
depending on their natures, they either kill themselves before their
next transformation or learn to revel in the butchery.

Motive: Slaughter when transformed; searching for answers when human

Environment: Anywhere dark, usually alone but sometimes as part of a
small pack of two to five

Health: 24

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Movement: Short; long when in wolf form

Modifications: Attacks as level 6 when half lupine; Speed defense as
level 6 when full lupine; perception as level 7 when half or full lupine

Combat: In normal human form, a werewolf has no natural attacks, though
it may use a weapon. It also lacks the abilities described below; its
only power is to transform into a half-lupine form or full-lupine form,
which takes 1d6 agonizing rounds. A handful of werewolves can control
their transformation, but most change at night in response to
moon-related cues.

*Half Lupine:* A half-lupine werewolf is part humanoid and part wolf,
but completely terrifying. It attacks with its claws.

*Full Lupine:* A full-lupine werewolf is a particularly large and
vicious-looking wolf. It normally bites foes and deals 2 additional
points of damage (7 points total) but can also use its claws.

*Half and Full Lupine:* Half-lupine and full-lupine werewolves both
enjoy enhanced senses and regain 2 points of health per round. However,
a werewolf that takes damage from a silver weapon or bullet stops
regenerating for several minutes.

Interaction: In human form, werewolves have the goals and aspirations of
normal people, and they often don’t recall what they did while
transformed or even realize that they suffer the curse of lycanthropy.
In half- or full-lupine form, there’s no negotiating with one.

Use: When the moon is full, werewolves hunt

GM intrusion: A PC who moves down one step on the damage track due to
damage inflicted by a werewolf must succeed on a Might defense roll or
be afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy.

WITCH 5 (15)

They studied the old ways at the dark of the moon. They heard the
shuffle of unnamed things through the darkling forest, watched the
convection of the bubbles rise in the cauldron, and attended to the
mumbled instructions of withered crones and crumbling messages traced on
dead leaves. Then one midnight, everything came together. Another witch
was born.

When witches lose sight of their humanity and use their powers for
personal gain without regard for others, they are warped by the power
they channel, both mentally and physically. However, they can hide such
transformations beneath layers of illusion.

Motive: Domination of others, knowledge

Environment: Almost anywhere, usually alone, but sometimes as part of a
coven of three to seven witches

Health: 21

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Movement: Short; long when flying (on a broomstick)

Modifications: Deception and disguise as level 7; Speed defense as level
6 due to familiar; knowledge of forests and dark secrets as level 6

Combat: When attacked, a witch relies on the aid of their familiar to
improve their Speed defense. The familiar could be a large black cat, an
owl, a big snake, or some other creature. Killing a witch’s familiar is
so shocking to a witch that their attacks and Speed defense are hindered
for a few days. It’s also a way to ensure that the witch never forgives
their foe or grants mercy.

(Familiar: level 3; health 9; Armor 1)

A witch can use their ritual blade to attack a creature in immediate
range, but would much rather use curses, including the ones described
below. A witch can’t use the same curse more than once every other
round.

*Charm:* Victims within short range who fail an Intellect defense roll
are enslaved. Victims turn on their allies or take some other action
described by their new master. The curse lasts for one minute, or until
the victims succeed on an Intellect defense roll; each time they fail a
roll, the next roll is hindered by one additional step.

*Hexbolt:* A victim within long range is attacked with fire, cold, or
psychic  
bolts, as the witch chooses. Psychic bolts deal 3 points of Intellect
damage (ignores Armor).

*Shrivel:* A victim within long range and up to two creatures next to
the victim must succeed on a Might defense roll or take 3 points of
Speed damage (ignores Armor). In each subsequent round, a victim who
failed the previous roll must make another Might defense roll with the
same outcome on failure.

*Vitality:* The witch regains 11 points of health and gains +3 to Armor
for one minute. Multiple uses don’t further improve Armor.

Interaction: Most witches are deceptive and conniving,  
though a few work against the stereotype. All witches are willing to
negotiate, though the devious ones usually do  
so in bad faith.

Use: The PCs need an old book to continue their investigation. Word is
that the old woman who lives on the edge of the woods has the only copy.

Loot: A witch usually has an artifact or two on their person, possibly
including a flying broom (which has a depletion roll of 1 in 1d10).

GM intrusion: After a character succeeds on a defense roll against one
of the witch’s ongoing curse effects, the witch immediately tosses a
hexbolt at them. If the character is hit, the ongoing curse effect also
continues.

WORM THAT WALKS 7 (21)

This sodden, leather-wrapped humanoid smells of the sea. It moves
effortlessly through the air, levitating above the ground while its damp
wrappings writhe and squirm as if infested with thousands of
worms—because they are. Each worm that walks is a mass of psionic grubs
squirming through a slush of salty ooze. Individually the grubs are
harmless vermin, but together they’re a sentient entity, a single
psionic mind formed of thousands of tiny, maggot-like pupae. The tightly
wound leather straps covering a worm that walks are just as important
for hiding its true nature as for adhesion. Despite being fully encased,
the worm that walks senses its environment with a hard-to-fool sixth
sense. 

Motive: Domination of other creatures, hunger 

Environment: Almost anywhere 

Health: 30 

Damage Inflicted: 7 points

Armor: 1 

Movement: Immediate; short when flying 

Modifications: Perception as level 8; Speed defense as level 5 due to
slow nature 

Combat: A worm that walks can strike a single target in immediate range
with a leather-wrapped “fist” as its action. When it hits and deals
damage, several grubs spill out and attach to the victim (getting under
most armor unless it’s hermetically sealed or behind a force field), who
must make a Might defense roll to shake them loose. On a failure, the
grubs begin to feed, and the target takes 5 points of damage (ignores
Armor).

If a victim is killed while in immediate range of a worm that walks, the
worms automatically engulf the body through a wide opening in their
wrappings. The grubs go into a feeding frenzy, reducing the remains to
nothing within minutes. During the frenzy, the worm that walks
regenerates 2 points of health per round. A victim’s equipment is
retained for later study. 

A worm that walks can also emit a psychic burst that can target up to
three creatures in short range as its action. On a failed Intellect
defense roll, a victim suffers 4 points of Intellect damage (ignores
Armor) and is unable to take actions on their subsequent turn. If the
victim is attacked while so stunned, their defenses are hindered by two
steps. 

Interaction: A worm that walks can communicate telepathically with
characters within short range. It negotiates only with those strong
enough to harm it; otherwise, it tries to eat whoever it runs across.
Even if the worm that walks makes a deal, it eventually reneges if it
senses any advantage for doing so. 

Use: A worm that walks has been active in a small rural community for
weeks, apparently in preparation for something it calls “the Great
Hatching.” If that refers to the hatching of more psychic grubs, it
could spell trouble for a much larger region. 

Loot: A worm that walks might have one or two cyphers, though during
combat it will use any devices that could help it in the fight.

GM intrusion: A character struck by the worm that walks notices that
they weren’t able to shake off all the grubs that spilled out. If they
fail a Speed defense roll, a grub dives into their flesh and travels
through their body, its route visible beneath their skin. The character
is distracted (all tasks hindered) until the grub dies one minute later
or is otherwise extracted

WRAITH 2 (6)

When a spirit of a dead creature fails to find its way to the
afterworld, escapes the same, or is summoned forth by a necromancer, it
may become a wraith: a bodiless spirit of rage and loss. A wraith
appears as a shadowy or misty figure that can resemble the humanoid
figure it once was, though wraiths tend to swarm together, making it
difficult to distinguish them from each other. Wraiths are often
mindless, consumed by their condition. But on occasion, a wraith not too
far gone still remembers its life and may respond to questions or seek
to locate its loved ones or enemies. A wraith may even attempt to finish
a task it started in life. But in time, even the strongest-willed
spirit’s mind erodes without physical substance to renew it, and it
becomes an almost mindless monster of destruction. 

Motive: Destruction 

Environment: Almost anywhere, singly or in groups of six to ten 

Health: 6 

Damage Inflicted: 3 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short while flying 

Modifications: Stealth as level 5 

Combat: A wraith attacks with its touch, which rots flesh and drains
life. 

A wraith can become fully insubstantial. After it does so, the creature
can’t change state again until its next turn. While insubstantial, it
can’t affect or be affected by anything (except for weapons and attacks
that specifically affect undead or phased creatures), and it can pass
through solid matter without hindrance, but even simple magical wards
can keep it at bay. While partly insubstantial (its normal state), a
wraith can affect and be affected by others normally. 

A group of five wraiths can act as a swarm, focusing on one target to
make one attack roll as a single level 4 creature dealing 5 points of
damage. 

Interaction: Most wraiths moan and scream in rage. The rare few that
retain reason can speak in a sepulchral voice, and they may even
negotiate. Any alliance with a wraith is usually short-lived, since the
creature eventually forgets itself and descends fully into rage and the
desire to spread destruction. 

Use: The PCs are attacked while attending a burial, or they happen to
pass close to or camp near a graveyard. Another swarm of wraiths appears
in a location where an earlier group was destroyed (indicating a
necromancer is summoning them).

GM intrusion: The wraith screams out, summoning 1d6 more wraiths from
the afterworld.

WYVERN 6 (18)

Wyverns are aggressive lesser cousins of dragons. Their bodies are about
the size of a heavy horse but their wingspan makes them seem much
larger. Lacking a dragon’s fiery breath or other magical abilities,
wyverns rely on their strong flight and deadly stinger to catch and kill
their prey, typically humanoids or large animals. Wyverns have four
limbs— two legs used for clumsy walking and two arm-wings used for
flight and balance. 

Motive: Hungers for flesh 

Environment: Mountains, hills, and plains where large prey is plentiful 

Health: 35 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short; long when flying 

Modifications: Perception as level 7; Speed defense as level 5 due to
size 

Combat: Wyverns prefer to attack from the air, moving up to a short
distance and making three attacks (bite, venomous stinger, claws) as
their action. If a wyvern has to fight on the ground, it can attack only
with its bite and stinger on its turn. 

The stinger injects poison, dealing an additional 5 points of Speed
damage (ignores Armor) if the opponent fails a Might defense roll.
Because the wyvern hunts primarily out of hunger, it usually focuses its
attacks on one creature, weakening the prey so the wyvern can carry it
away and eat in peace. 

Interaction: Wyverns lack the intelligence of true dragons. They are
relatively smart animals (on par with large reptiles such as crocodiles)
but can be distracted by easy prey. Allowing one to catch a pig, pony,
or riding horse can give characters enough time to get safely away. 

Use: Hungry wyverns are known to swoop in and carry off livestock and
travelers near a particular road or field. A gang of crafty bandits has
managed to train a couple of wyverns as mounts and use them as flying
cavalry for their troops on the ground.

 Loot: Wyverns do not collect treasure, but their nest might have a few
cyphers from previous victims. If carefully extracted, an intact venom
gland from a dead wyvern can be used to poison one weapon (if sold, it
is the equivalent of an expensive item).

GM intrusions: As part of its attack, the wyvern grabs hold of the
character and flies a short distance away. The character can escape with
a Might or Speed defense roll (which probably means they fall to the
ground and land prone). The wyvern uses a wing or its tail to slam a
character so they are thrown a short distance away and land prone.

XENOPARASITE 6 (18)

This alien creature exists only to eat and reproduce. In doing so, it
also destroys every form of life it encounters. Xenoparasites are not
technological but were likely engineered by a species with advanced
biological super-science. Xenoparasites don’t travel between star
systems on their own; they were presumably spread across an area of
space by their creators to serve as a broad-spectrum bioweapon. What has
become of the original maker species is unknown, but given the fecundity
and ferocity of the xenoparasite, it’s likely they were consumed by
their own creation.

Xenoparasites use ovipositors to lay thousands of microscopic eggs in
victims. The implanted eggs, like tiny biological labs, detect the
particular biology of the new host, adapt accordingly, and use it to
fertilize themselves. Within a day or two, victims who haven’t already
been consumed by adult xenoparasites (which are human sized) give
explosive birth to multiple vicious juveniles (which are the size of
cats). These juvenile xenoparasites have an edge in dealing with the
particular species of creature they hatched from.

Motive: Eat and reproduce

Environment: Hunts alone or in small groups

Health: 28

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Armor: 2

Movement: Short; long when flying

Modifications: All stealth actions as level 8

Combat: A xenoparasite bites with its mandibles and stings one victim
with its ovipositor as a single action. The bite inflicts 6 points of
damage, and the ovipositor inflicts 3 points of damage and injects
thousands of microscopic eggs if the victim fails a Might defense roll.

Once every other round, an adult can fly at least a short distance to
build terrifying velocity and then make a flying attack with its
mandibles, dealing 12 points of damage. Defenses against this attack are
hindered.

An egg host requires the attention of someone skilled in medicine (and a
successful difficulty 7  
Intellect-based roll) to sterilize all the eggs in the victim’s blood
before they hatch twenty or more hours after being deposited, which
kills the host and releases 1d6 juvenile xenoparasites. Juveniles are
level 2 creatures, but they attack the species of the host they were
hatched from as if level 4. After just a few days of feeding, they grow
to full adult size.

Xenoparasites can survive at crushing ocean and gas giant pressures, as
well as in the vacuum of space. They can encrust abandoned spacecraft
and desolate moons for millennia in extended hibernation, only to become
active again when vibrations alert them to potential new food sources.

Interaction: These creatures are built to consume,  
not negotiate.

Use: Xenoparasites are tough aliens. A colony of them would be a
challenge even for PCs normally accustomed to stiff opposition. A single
xenoparasite introduced into an inhabited area could turn the entire
place into an infested hive within a week.

GM (group) intrusion: An NPC shrieks, bursts, and births 1d6 juvenile
xenoparasites.

ZOMBIE 3 (9)

Humans transformed into aggressive, hard-to-kill serial killers with no
memory of their former existence are called zombies. Depending on a
zombie’s origin, the reason for its transformation varies. A zombie
might arise from an undead curse, a psychic possession, an AI meatware
overwrite, a viral infection, a drug overdose, or something else.
Regardless of how the transformation happened, the result is much the
same: a creature whose humanity has been burned out and replaced with
unquenchable hunger.

Zombies aren’t intelligent, but enough of them together sometimes
exhibit emergent behavior, just as ants can coordinate activities across
a colony. Thus, zombies alone or in small groups aren’t an overwhelming
threat for someone who has a baseball bat or can get away. But it’s
never wise to laugh off a zombie horde.

Motive: Hunger (for flesh, cerebrospinal fluid, certain human hormones,
and so on)

Environment: Almost anywhere, in groups of five to seven, or in hordes
of tens to hundreds

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 3 points

Movement: Immediate

Modifications: Speed defense as level 2

Combat: Zombies never turn away from a conflict.  
They fight on, no matter the odds, usually attacking by biting, but
sometimes by tearing with hands made into claws by the erosion of skin
over their finger bones.

When zombies attack in groups of five to seven individuals, they can
make a single attack roll against one target as one level 5 creature,
inflicting 5 points of damage.

Zombies are hard to finish off. If an attack would reduce a zombie’s
health to 0, it does so only if the number rolled in the attack was an
even number; otherwise, the zombie is reduced to 1 point of health
instead. This might result in a dismembered, gruesomely damaged zombie  
that is still moving. Zombies can see in the dark  
at short range.

“Fresh” zombies are vulnerable to electricity. The first time a zombie
takes 5 or more points of damage from an electrical attack, it falls
limp and unmoving. Assuming nothing interferes with the process, the
zombie arises minutes or hours later without the vulnerability.

Some zombies are infectious. Their bites spread a  
level 8 disease that moves a victim down one step on the damage track
each day a Might defense roll is failed. Victims killed by the disease
later animate as zombies.

Interaction: Zombies groan when they see something that looks tasty.
They do not reason, cannot speak, and never stop pursuing something
they’ve identified as a potential meal, unless something else edible
comes closer.

Use: The characters are asked to clear out a space that once served as
an old military depot. The appearance of zombies sealed in the area
comes as an unpleasant surprise.

GM intrusion: When the character fails to kill a zombie by rolling an
odd number on an attack that otherwise would have been successful, in
addition to the normal effect, the zombie’s arm comes free and animates
as a separate level 2 zombie.

SUPERVILLIANS

People with amazing abilities who use them for evil earn the label of
supervillain. This section presents five sample supervillains. These
supervillains use the same format as the Creatures chapter.

ANATHEMA 7 (21)

The supervillain called Anathema is big, bright red, and stronger than
anyone on this planet or any other (or so he claims). Superheroes who go
head to head with him learn that he can withstand almost any hit and
always gives back twice as hard as he receives. He can bring down
buildings with a punch and throw semi trucks across state lines.

Before he was Anathema, he was Sameer Stokes, a bitter and spiteful
coder working for a large software company. Having failed in
relationships, promotions, and retaining friends, Sameer retreated
online and learned that he had power when he bullied people. He
delighted in causing emotional distress in others in forums and social
media. In effect, he was a troll. When the metamorphosis happened, he
was turned into a troll for real. (Sameer doesn’t recall the
metamorphosis or the days before and immediately after his change,
despite using therapy and drugs in an attempt to recover those
memories.)

(Assume that Anathema has three power shifts in strength and two in
resilience. These shifts are already figured into his modifications and
other stats.)

Motive: Accumulate wealth, live on the edge

Environment: Anywhere vast wealth can be stolen

Health: 70

Damage Inflicted: 12 points

Movement: Short; a few miles (5 km) per leap

Modifications: Strength tasks as level 10; Might defense as level 9;
Speed defense as level 5 due to size

Combat: Anathema hits foes with bone-shocking force. He can throw cars
and large objects at targets within long range, dealing damage to all
creatures within immediate range of his target.

Anathema has a healing factor that makes it hard to hurt him in any
meaningful sense. He regains 10 points of health per round. In any round
in which he regains health, his attacks deal 3 additional points of
damage (15 total), and he seems to visibly swell with muscle.

Interaction: When Anathema is riled up during a fight, it’s difficult to
reason with him. However, he is willing to negotiate if someone offers
him wealth or convinces him they have valuable secrets for breaking
mental blocks. Anathema doesn’t know how he became the way he is, and he
wants to recover his missing memories.

Use: The rolling earthquake afflicting the city is actually Anathema
fighting a group of newbie superheroes who haven’t figured out that
engaging the red mountain will likely cause more deaths than leaving him
alone. (The first rule of fighting Anathema is to lead or move him
somewhere with a low population density.)

Loot: Anathema doesn’t normally carry wealth or other valuables. In his
lair, Anathema typically has three to five expensive items, 1d6 cyphers,
and possibly an artifact.

GM intrusion: Anathema’s attack sends the character flying a long
distance and potentially into dangerous terrain.

DOCTOR DREAD 7 (21)

Doctor Dread is larger than life thanks to her brilliant mind, her media
savvy, and the robotic armor she uses to enhance her otherwise normal
abilities. Indeed, Doctor Dread has become the most feared terrorist on
the planet. She uses her abilities to extort money, influence, and
technology from the rich and powerful, whether her victims are
individuals, governments, corporations, or superheroes.

Alicia Coleridge is Doctor Dread’s secret identity. Born into relative
obscurity, she received a full scholarship to the Russell Institute of
Technology, where she studied the effects of radioactive substances on
living tissue. In a freak lab accident, Alicia’s
fianc<span dir="rtl">é</span> was slain, and Alicia was disfigured and
driven slightly insane, so much so that she built the Doctor Dread
armor. She plows the vast wealth she accumulates through terrorism into
research into the rejuvenation of dead flesh. She hopes to one day bring
back her dead love, whose body she keeps in suspended animation.

(Doctor Dread is usually accompanied by a handful of robot minions.)

(Dread’s robot minion: level 3; Armor 1; long-range laser attack
inflicts 4 points of damage)

(Assume that Doctor Dread has three power shifts in intelligence and two
in resilience. These shifts are already figured into her modifications
and other stats.)

Motive: Accumulate wealth; reanimate dead flesh

Environment: Wherever money can be extorted

Health: 40

Damage Inflicted: 7 points

Armor: 4

Movement: Short; long when flying

Modifications: Resists mental attacks and deception as level 8;
understands, repairs, and crafts advanced technology as level 10

Combat: Doctor Dread’s armor allows her to exist without outside air (or
air pressure), food, or water for up to ten days at a time. She can call
on her robotic armor to accomplish a variety of tasks, including the
following:

*Barricade:* Establish an immobile, two-dimensional field  
of transparent force 10 feet by 10 feet (3 m by 3 m) for ten minutes

*Energy Cloak:* Create an energy field that gives her +5 to Armor
against heat, cold, or magnetism (one at a time, chosen when she uses
the power) for ten minutes

*Fade:* Become invisible for one minute, or until she makes an attack

*Plasma Blast:* Long-range heat and electricity blast that inflicts 7
points of damage

Interaction: Doctor Dread is slightly mad, but that’s normally disguised
by her amazing brilliance. She is an egomaniac but will negotiate in
return for a promise of wealth or biomedical lore she doesn’t already
know.

Use: The PCs are called to handle a hostage situation at a party in
which many of the city’s wealthy elite are being held captive by Doctor
Dread. She promises to let them go once sufficient wealth is paid into
her offshore accounts.

Loot: Most of Doctor Dread’s considerable wealth is tied up in online
accounts, two or three secret fortresses, and cutting-edge biological
research equipment.

GM intrusion: Doctor Dread uses a function built into her robotic armor
that is the perfect solution for her current predicament: healing
herself, teleporting away, disintegrating a barrier, or whatever is
needed.

MAGNETAR 8 (24)

Not much is known about Magnetar other than its powerful ability to
generate and control magnetic fields. Various research groups theorize
that Magnetar is an alien, a sentient and self-improving robot, or even
some kind of manifestation of a fundamental force. Given Magnetar’s
vaguely humanoid shape, a few people even suggest that the villain is
actually a man with a mutant ability so powerful that it burned out all
memories of his former self.

In truth, Magnetar is the animate, sentient, and self-regulating nucleus
of a neutron star that is able to rein in its immense electromagnetic
signature. One of two such beings an advanced alien species created from
a single magnetar (a type of neutron star with an extremely powerful
magnetic field), Magnetar was sent on a mission of exploration. After
millennia, it crashed on Earth and was damaged. Having lost most of its
memory data, Magnetar knows that something was taken from it (its twin),
but it can’t remember what. It has decided to blame the humans.

(Assume that Magnetar has three power shifts in its magnetic power and
two in resilience. These shifts are already figured into its
modifications and other stats.)

Motive: Revenge; regain memory

Environment: Almost anywhere, searching for what it has lost

Health: 50

Damage Inflicted: 12 points

Armor: 8

Movement: Short; long when magnetically levitating

Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to mass; tasks related to
controlling and shaping metal through electromagnetic manipulation as
level 11

Combat: Magnetar’s fist packs a wallop, since it can selectively add
mass to the punch. However, its most potent ability is its level 11
control over all metal within very long range, which it uses to create
anything it can imagine, including walls, attacks, pincers, and more.
Magnetar can lift bridges, vehicles, and structures infused with rebar
that it can see within its area of influence. When it throws such a
large object as part of an attack, the target and everything within
short range of the target takes 10 points of damage.

Magnetar’s only weakness is psychic attacks, which is fortunate since
reducing it to 0 health through an  
old-fashioned beating could release an uncontrolled neutron star chunk
on the Earth’s surface.

Interaction: Morose and gruff, Magnetar would rather be alone, but every
so often, it goes on a rampage, hoping that a display will draw out
whoever or whatever made it the way it is. Magnetar constantly feels the
drag of emotional loss, but it doesn’t know why (it doesn’t realize that
the feeling comes from the loss of its twin).

Use: Doctor Dread has put a bounty on Magnetar’s head because she wants
to study the advanced technology woven through its body. The bounty
amount is outrageous, but then again, so is Magnetar.

GM intrusion: On a failed Might defense roll, all of the character’s
loose metallic items (including weapons) are stripped from them and
become stuck to a nearby metallic buttress.

MISTER GENOCIDE 5 (15)

Real name Alfred Webster, Mister Genocide has the unfortunate ability to
synthesize deadly poison from his skin. His touch can kill, but if he
wishes it, so can his spittle or even his breath.

Anyone who spends too much time in Mister Genocide’s presence becomes
ill, even if the villain isn’t actively using his power. Thus, his
cronies usually wear gas masks and protective clothing. Mister Genocide
has promoted himself to the head of the mob in the city where he resides
and is always looking to expand his operations, sometimes at the expense
of other criminals.

When victims are killed by Mister Genocide’s poison, their skin and the
whites of their eyes take on a bright green hue, which increases the
terror that normal people feel regarding him. Even superheroes have been
brought down by his toxins.

Mister Genocide sometimes teams up with Anathema, because the red
mountain is the only villain who can withstand the poison that Genocide
constantly emits.

(Assume that Mister Genocide has two power shifts in his poison power,
one in intelligence, and two in resilience. These shifts are already
figured into his modifications and other stats.)

Motive: Accumulate power

Environment: Anywhere crime lords congregate

Health: 15

Damage Inflicted: 5 points; see Combat

Armor: 1

Movement: Short

Modifications: Poison breath attack and Might defense as level 7;
Intellect defense and evil genius as level 6

Combat: Targets touched by Mister Genocide must make a difficulty 7
Might defense roll or take 5 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) from
the poison transmitted. Worse, the poison continues to inflict 2 points
of Speed damage each round until the victim succeeds at a Might defense
roll.

Every other round, Mister Genocide can make a level 7 poison attack that
can affect up to ten victims within short range as a single action.
Those who fail a Might defense roll take 7 points of Speed damage
(ignores Armor) and spend a round helpless as they cough and gag. The
inhalant poison does not continue to inflict damage  
each round.

Mister Genocide is immune to most venoms, toxins, and poisons.

Interaction: Certifiably insane, Mister Genocide likes to kill people.
He may negotiate for a while, but if there is not enough gain to be had,
he might kill everyone with a breath just for the fun of watching them
suffocate and turn green.

Use: Gang warfare between two criminal organizations is shooting up
downtown, and many innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire end up
bullet-ridden or poisoned (with green skin). Someone needs to put a stop
to Mister Genocide.

Loot: The supervillain carries currency equivalent to 1d6 expensive
items, a cypher or two, and a variety of poisoned knives, needles, and
vials.

GM intrusion: A character affected by the poison must make a second
Might defense roll or fall unconscious from shock. Unconsciousness lasts
for up to a minute, or until the victim is jostled awake.

WRATH 6 (18)

The head of an elite group of assassins, Wrath wants to save the world
by killing everyone who impedes her vision of perfection—which turns out
to be the better part of humanity. In addition to being one of the most
accomplished martial artists to walk the earth (thanks to her connection
with a mystical entity called the Demon), Wrath is also a criminal
mastermind whose assassins are just one layer of the organization she
controls.

Born more than two hundred and fifty years ago in China to a name lost
to history, Wrath was taken in by a monastery and trained in the ways of
fist and sword. Everything changed when raiders attacked and killed
everyone in her monastery, leaving her the sole survivor. Vowing revenge
against the raiders and the world that allowed animals like them to
exist, she acquired a magical amulet that contains the Demon. The Demon
in turn bequeathed her extraordinary speed, strength, and longevity.

Wrath is content to let her assassins (and mobsters, lawyers, and
politicians) accomplish many of her goals, though she relishes being
present when particularly important adversaries are brought down.

(Assassin of Wrath: level 4, stealth as level 7)

(Assume that Wrath has two power shifts in dexterity, two in accuracy,
and one in resilience. These shifts are already figured into her
modifications and other stats.)

Motive: Save the world

Environment: Anywhere wrongs (to Wrath’s way of thinking) must be
righted

Health: 36

Damage Inflicted: 8 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short

Modifications: Stealth, attacks, and Speed defense as level 8

Combat: Wrath prefers a sword, though she is equally adept with a
crossbow or, in rare cases, modern weapons. In melee she can attack two
foes as a single action every round.

Thanks to the influence of the Demon, Wrath regains 3 points of health
each round, even if reduced to 0 health. The only way to permanently
kill her is to reduce her to 0 health and keep her that way long enough
to burn away the tattoo of the Demon that is engraved across her back.

Interaction: Wrath is arrogant and confident, though not so much that
she is easily fooled by flattery. She is usually amenable to
negotiating, because she can anticipate the agenda of others and usually
gain far more for herself in the end. However, she is not one to betray
her word.

Use: Wrath is making a bid to form a group of supervillains—all of whom
will answer to her, of course—and it seems that initial talks are going
well. The only holdout is Mister Genocide, who feels threatened by
Wrath’s larger organization, and this tension has led to ongoing warfare
in the streets as assassins battle mobsters.

Loot: In addition to weapons and armor, Wrath likely possesses the
equivalent of five exorbitant items, 1d6 cyphers, and possibly one or
two artifacts.

GM intrusion: Just as things seem bleakest for her, Wrath summons a
group of assassins waiting in the wings to surround the PCs and demand
their surrender.

NPCs

The NPCs in this chapter are generic examples of nonplayer characters
that can be used in many genres.

Reskinning NPCs: GMs will find that with a few tweaks, a guard can be a
modern-day cop, a fantasy caravan guard, or a science fiction drone
soldier. This is known as reskinning—making slight changes to existing
stats to customize the NPC for your own game.

Health, Not Pools: Remember that NPCs don’t have stat Pools. Instead,
they have a characteristic called health. When an NPC takes damage of
any kind, the amount is subtracted from its health. Unless described
otherwise, an NPC’s health is always equal to its target number. Some
NPCs might have special reactions to or defenses against attacks that
would normally deal Speed damage or Intellect damage, but unless the
NPC’s description specifically explains this, assume that all damage is
subtracted from the NPC’s health.

Appropriate Weapons: NPCs use weapons appropriate to their situation,
which might be swords and crossbows, knives and shotguns, malefic
psychic weapons, blasters and grenades, and so on.

OTHER NPCs

Many NPCs are simple and understandable enough to be encapsulated just
by their level and a few other other relevant stats.

Cannibal: level 3, deception and other interaction tasks as level 6;
health 12

Hacker: level 2; programming, digital infiltration, and repairing
computers as level 7

Mad scientist: level 4, most actions as level 6 due to gadgets, serums,
artifacts, etc.

Marauder: level 4, initiative and intimidation as level 7; health 28;
Armor 1

Master detective: level 5; perception, intuition, initiative, and
detecting falsehood as level 9

Politician: level 2, all interaction tasks as level 6

Priest: level 2, religious lore and all interaction tasks as level 6

Professor: level 2, knowledge of science and all interaction tasks as
level 6

Soldier: level 3, perception as level 4; health 12; Armor 1; attacks
inflict 5 points of damage

ASSASSIN 6 (18)

An assassin kills with poison, with high-velocity bullets from a
distance, or by arranging for an unfortunate accident. Assassins accept
contracts from governments, corporations, crime bosses, and aggrieved
former partners, though some assassins pay themselves by tracking
criminals anywhere to collect on “dead or alive” bounties.

Motive: Murder (usually for hire)

Health: 18

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short

Modifications: Stealth and deception tasks as level 8; when attacking
from hiding, melee and ranged attacks as level 7

Combat: An assortment of small weapons are hidden about an assassin’s
body. They can also coat their weapons or ammo with a level 6 poison
that moves victims who fail a Might defense roll one step down the
damage track.

Interaction: Some assassins have a sort of integrity about their work
and can’t be dissuaded from completing their contracts with bribes.

Use: An assassin is greatly feared by anyone with powerful, wealthy
enemies.

Loot: Aside from their weapons and poisons, most assassins have currency
equivalent to a very expensive item and maybe one or two cyphers.

GM intrusion: The character loses their next turn, stunned, after
recognizing the assassin to be the same murderer who killed someone
important to them in the past.

BARD 3 (9)

A bard uses the power of words and music to create magic that inspires
and influences others. A typical bard plays a musical instrument and
weaves song-spells that rival the magic of wizards and priests, but some
use their voices, creating fascinating tales and dramatic speeches. 

Motive: Entertainment, interaction, and novel experiences 

Health: 10 

Damage Inflicted: 3 points 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Music, oration, persuasion, stealth, and Speed defense as
level 4 

Combat: Bards prefer weapons that rely on speed and agility, like
daggers, rapiers, and small bows. Every other round, a bard can create a
blast of pure sound that inflicts 3 points of damage (ignores Armor) to
one target within short range. 

A bard knows several spells, such as adding +1 to recovery rolls of
nearby creatures, making an indifferent creature friendly (or a hostile
one indifferent) for a few minutes, deafening one opponent for hours,
easing a physical task by two steps, turning invisible for a minute, or
negating sound for a minute. 

Interaction: Bards are personable and easy to talk to, but they have a
sharp wit and a sharper tongue when it comes to critics and tyrants. A
bard would rather escape from a dangerous situation than fight to the
death. 

Use: A bard ally often has useful information about the current
situation, drawn from songs and folk tales. In a pinch, they can make do
as a scout or spy, especially in an urban setting. An unfriendly bard
mocks the characters and turns the will of a crowd against them. 

Loot: In addition to a musical instrument and a nice outfit for
performing, bards usually have currency equivalent to a moderately
priced item and one or two cyphers.

BERSERKER 3 (9)

A berserker is a fierce warrior who can fly into a rage, greatly
increasing their strength and hardiness. Many of them choose an animal
such as a bear, wolf, or boar as their spiritual kin, wearing the skin
of that animal and fighting like wild beasts. 

Motive: Glory in battle 

Health: 12 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Armor: 1 (or 3 when berserk) 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Climbing, jumping, running, and Speed defense as level 4 

Combat: Berserkers prefer large, heavy weapons such as axes, hammers,
and greatswords, but they may use bows if they can’t easily get close to
their foes. 

A berserker can enter a state of rage as part of their action. When
raging, they gain +1 to Armor (including against fire), their melee
attacks inflict an additional 2 points of damage, and their attacks,
Might defense, and actions relying on strength (such as climbing and
jumping) are eased by two steps. However, their Speed defense is
hindered. A raging berserker fights only with melee weapons and won’t
retreat from battle.

 Interaction: Berserkers are the elites of some warrior cultures and
enjoy physical competitions such as wrestling, throwing heavy items, and
feasting. They dislike weak and cowardly folk, and do not tolerate
insults to their strength or honor. 

Use: A group of warriors is led by a mighty berserker looking for a
challenging fight. A group of berserkers enters town and picks fights
with the local toughs. 

Loot: In addition to their weapons and light armor, a berserker has one
or two moderately priced items. The leader of a group might have a
cypher that enhances strength or toughness.

CRIME BOSS 3 (9)

A crime boss usually isn’t physically powerful but wields power through
lies, bribery, and control. Rarely encountered alone, they rely on
guards, thugs, and other measures to provide physical security. A crime
boss could be a petty noble, a mafia king, or the captain of a pirate
ship that sails the seas or glides the space lanes.

Motive: Money and power

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short

Modifications: Deception, persuasion, intimidation, and tasks related to
friendly interaction as level 7

Combat: Guards, thugs, and other followers deal 1 additional point of
damage when the crime boss can see them and issue commands. If possible,
crime bosses fight while mounted or in a vehicle, directing their
followers from the rear of any conflict, concentrating first on issuing
orders.

Interaction: Crime bosses are committed to their plans, whatever those
might be. Most bosses rely on a lieutenant or trusted thug to interact
with people in their place.

Use: A crime boss and their followers execute a heist on a secure
location and take hostages when things go south. Someone must go in and
talk to the crime boss to defuse the situation.

Loot: A crime boss has currency equivalent to a very expensive item in
addition to weapons, medium armor, and miscellaneous gear.

GM intrusion: The crime boss uses a clever trick or cypher to block all
incoming attacks in a given round of combat.

DETECTIVE 3 (9)

Detectives are usually veterans of their organization (such as the
police, city watch, marshals, space command, and so on) with extensive
experience. Some detectives are freelance sleuths whose uncanny ability
to see the truth comes from personal training combined with an
underlying talent for noticing clues that others miss.

Motive: Solve the crime

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Tasks relating to perception, intuition, initiative, and
detecting falsehoods as level 6

Combat: Detectives prefer to outwit their foes rather than engage in a
straight-up fight. Even then, most conflicts occur in a place and time
of the detective’s choosing, preferably in the presence of their allies.
A detective can deduce weaknesses of their enemies (if any) and exploit
them in combat.

Interaction: Some detectives are insufferable  
know-it-alls. Others have learned that humility is also a useful tool
for getting answers from people.

Use: To the PCs, detectives can be obstacles (a detective is on their
trail), allies (a detective helps them assemble clues), or both, but the
sleuths are rarely a way for the characters to hand off responsibility
for accomplishing a hard task.

Loot: Aside from their weapons, most detectives have currency equivalent
to a very expensive item and a cypher.

GM intrusion: The detective intuits the character’s next attack and
moves perfectly so that an ally of the character takes the attack
instead.

DRUID 4 (12)

A druid is a servant of a nature deity or the entirety of nature itself.
Some have specific interests such as animals, plants, or storms, with
greater powers relating to that devotion. Druids are leaders and
advisors in some cultures, society-hating hermits in others. 

Motive: Protecting nature 

Health: 12 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Nature lore, perception, and stealth as level 5 

Combat: Druids use simple weapons crafted out of natural materials, such
as spears, slings, and bows, as well as ritual tools such as daggers and
sickles. 

A druid knows several spells, such as a short-range attack that uses
electricity or fire, healing a touched creature for 4 health, calming
and befriending animals, traveling quickly, controlling the weather
within long range, transforming into an animal or plant, and
manipulating the natural elements. A druid often has a loyal animal
companion, such as a black bear, hawk, viper, or wolf. 

Interaction: Druids are cautious when dealing with city folk, and they
act quickly to stop the reckless use of fire or exploitation of the
wilds. They are generally on good terms with local animals and magical
creatures of nature (faeries, sapient trees, satyrs, and so on). 

Use: A hermit druid comes to the aid of injured or lost characters in
the wildlands. A druid has been attacking loggers and hunters who stray
too far from civilization. 

Loot: In addition to weapons, light armor, and some moderately priced
ritual items, a druid might have a couple of cyphers or perhaps an
artifact.

DWARF 4(12)

A typical dwarf found outside of their homeland is an explorer, warrior,
and tradesperson of some skill. Dwarves travel to find work as
mercenaries, sell the goods they create, or find unusual materials to
use in their crafting. 

Motive: Defense, loyalty, honor 

Health: 15 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Armor: 2 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Crafting (metal or stone), Intellect defense, and Might
defense as level 5 

Combat: Dwarves traditionally use weapons like axes, hammers, and
crossbows. They’re used to working together to defend their halls; three
or more dwarves attacking the same target act as a level 6 creature that
inflicts 8 points of damage. 

Dwarf leaders are usually officers or priests.

Dwarf officer: level 5; health 16; damage inflicted 7 points Dwarf
priest: level 5; health 16; can heal one creature for 10 points or all
within immediate range for 5 points

 Interaction: Dwarves are proud and hardworking, but they tend to be
stubborn, gruff, and unforgiving of offenses to them or their clan. It
takes time to gain their trust, but they respect a fair deal, a hard
bargain, a sharp axe, and a sturdy hammer. 

Use: A stoic old dwarf is looking to go on one more quest before
retiring. A clan of dwarves seeks a trade agreement with a human city
leader—or redress for an old insult.

Loot: In addition to their weapons and light or medium armor, a dwarf
probably has several moderately priced items (such as tools or
exploration gear) and perhaps a cypher or two.

ELF 4 (12)

An elf has a very long lifespan and tends to learn and abandon many
skills and interests, including combat and magic. Elves are likely to
wander in pursuit of something new and interesting, such as finding the
tallest tree in the forest, the most beautiful sunset, or the perfect
love song. 

Motive: Curiosity 

Health: 12 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Perception, Speed defense, and any two noncombat skills
as level 5 

Combat: Elves usually fight with short or medium blades and delicate but
deadly bows. Because of their subtle skill and fast reactions, their
first attack in any combat inflicts an additional 2 points of damage. 

A typical elf might know a few minor spells, such as heating or chilling
food, creating a bit of moonlight, and cleaning or repairing clothing.

Interaction: Elves appreciate beauty, grace, and skill, and they don’t
respond well to crudeness or bluster, especially from people decades or
centuries younger than themselves. They are subtle in their insults but
do have a sense of humor. 

Use: A group of young elves arrives in a city, wanting to see firsthand
how the short-lived humans do things. An elf is said to have lived in
the forest for a thousand years, listening to the secrets whispered by
the trees.

Loot: In addition to their weapons and light armor, an elf carries a few
moderately priced (but extremely well-made) curios and mementos, and
usually a cypher.

GUARD 2 (6)

Guards keep the peace but don’t usually show much initiative.
Ultimately, they do as they’re ordered by their superiors, regardless of
legality. A guard might be a star trooper dressed in intimidating armor,
a mall security guard, a beat police officer, or a mafia goon.

(When attacked, guards always call for the help of other guards, if
possible.)

Motive: Keep the peace; follow orders

Health: 8

Damage Inflicted: 3 points

Armor: 1 or 2

Movement: Short

Modifications: Perception as level 3

Combat: Guards are not often wily, but they understand strength in
numbers. If two or more guards attack the same target with at least one
melee attack in the same round, the target’s Speed defense roll against
those attacks is hindered.

Interaction: Interacting with a guard typically involves one issue: does
the PC want to do something that the guard has been told to prevent? If
so, the PC could have a difficult time.

Use: To the PCs, guards can be allies, obstacles, or both. Guards who
serve the public good have their own duties and aren’t interested in
doing the characters’ work for them.

Loot: A guard has currency equivalent to an inexpensive item in addition
to weapons, armor, and basic gear.

GM intrusion: 1d6 local citizens intervene on the guard’s behalf,
calling for more guards or even fighting the guard’s foes.

HALFLING 3 (9)

A halfling is fond of the comforts of home, but adventures and
exploration are the fodder of great stories told over tea or dinner, or
in a fireside chat. Quick, resourceful, and easy to get along with,
halflings fit right in with brave big folk as scouts, burglars, and
loyal companions. 

Motive: Defense, comfort 

Health: 9 

Damage Inflicted: 3 points 

Armor: 0 or 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Intellect defense, pleasant social interactions, and
stealth as level 4 

Combat: Halflings are remarkably skilled with knives, clubs, slings, and
small bows. They prefer not to fight larger creatures head on; instead
they stay at range, plan ambushes to quickly overwhelm opponents, or
team up with a larger ally so they can attack a foe’s back and legs.

Interaction: Halflings enjoy the company of larger folks as long as they
aren’t mocked for their size. They’re brave and determined when they
need to be, though some might complain about wanting to go home. 

Use: A young halfling wants to have some adventures before settling
down. The local thieves’ guild is said to employ halflings as lookouts
and cutpurses, sometimes disguised as human children. 

Loot: In addition to their weapons (and perhaps some light armor) and
food, a halfling might have an interesting cypher or two. Most carry
several useful moderately priced items, or an expensive item such as an
heirloom snuff box or a nice bag of tools.

OCCULTIST 5 (15)

Paranormal researchers, cultists, secret practitioners of white magic,
and coven members might be occultists. Thanks to their study of the
metaphysical, occultists learn several magical tricks, including the
ability to summon or banish the dead.

Health: 15

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Knowledge of occult topics and rituals as level 8;
ability to detect lies and tricks as level 2

Combat: An occultist has a charm or device for summoning a level 5
spirit or demon that will do their bidding for ten minutes. Some also
have (or instead have) a spell, item, or device that inflicts 5 points
of damage on normal creatures within long range, and 10 points of damage
on a demon or spirit (or, instead of dealing extra damage, the effect
confines the demon or spirit in some way).

Interaction: Occultists are deeply concerned with spiritual or demonic
matters and see those influences in all things, whether those influences
exist or not. That makes them amenable to persuasion and deception, if
couched in the language of spiritual influence.

Use: To find a needed answer, the spirit of a dead person must be
questioned. Alternatively, a haunting presence must be banished. Either
way, the task requires an occultist.

Loot: In addition to their clothing and mundane weapons, occultists have
currency equivalent to an inexpensive item, a cypher, and possibly an
artifact related to their power over spirits or demons.

GM intrusion: A bony hand erupts from the ground at the character’s
feet. On a failed Speed defense roll, they are held in place until they
succeed on a Might-based task to escape. Each round the character fails
to escape, the hand squeezes for 3 points of damage.

PALADIN 4 (12)

Paladins are heroes who swear a holy oath to vanquish evil. Their power
and righteousness are a gift and a heavy burden, and most of them expect
to die in battle against an evil foe. 

Motive: Protecting the innocent, destroying evil 

Health: 15 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Armor: 2 or 3 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Attacks and Might defense as level 5 

Combat: Paladins like flashy weapons and shiny armor, which help them
show their devotion to the ideals of goodness and draw the attention of
evil foes. Many choose a two-handed weapon, but some prefer using a
shield in their off hand (defense-oriented paladins like these inflict
only 4 points of damage with their attacks but gain an asset on Speed
defense). 

Blessed by the powers of good, paladins can draw on innate holy magic
for several purposes, such as detecting the presence of supernatural
evil (demons, evil dragons, undead, and so on), restoring 4 health to
themselves or a touched creature, smiting an evil foe to inflict an
additional 4 points of damage, or breaking free of mind control. 

Interaction: Paladins have big personalities and strongly believe in
their purpose and goals. They have no tolerance for evil acts and are
unwilling to look the other way when their allies want to bend the rules
or take advantage of a “grey area.” However, they are not fools and
won’t throw away their lives for nothing. 

Use: A paladin lays claim to a foe the characters are seeking or have
captured. An old paladin is looking for one last villain to smite. 

Loot: In addition to their weapons and armor, paladins might have one or
two cyphers. More experienced ones might be lucky enough to have an
artifact (usually a weapon or armor).

SECRET AGENT 5 (15)

Secret agents are trained professionals who put their mission before
their own well-being, regardless of which government agency,
corporation, guild, or kingdom employs them. An agent operates under a
fake cover, perhaps as an envoy, inspector, technician, actor, tourist,
or bumbling fool.

Motive: Accomplish the goals of the employer while maintaining cover

Health: 15

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Tasks related to disguise and deceiving as level 6

Combat: A secret agent always has a covert, unexpected backup weapon
that they can use to make a surprise attack, such as a ring or glove
with a hidden poisoned needle (dealing 5 points of Speed damage that
ignore Armor), a fake tooth filled with poison gas to blow in a victim’s
face (inducing sleep for ten minutes), or a ring with a miniature gun.

Interaction: Secret agents are confident, masterful, and always give the
impression of being one step ahead of the game, even when caught off
guard.

Use: As an ally, a secret agent can guide the PCs to their next mission,
fill in gaps in their knowledge, and warn them of dangers. If the
characters encounter an unfriendly agent, the NPC likely pretends to be
a friend.

Loot: Agents typically have currency equivalent to an expensive item, a
couple of cyphers, tools for spying and maintaining their cover, and
possibly an artifact.

GM intrusion: The secret agent produces a cypher that, for the rest of
the day, eases all tasks by two steps.

THIEF 4 (12)

A thief takes things that don’t belong to them—preferably with their
victim remaining unaware of the crime until the thief is safely away.
Burglars and pickpockets are the most common sort, but ambitious thieves
are known to plan elaborate heists to steal priceless items from
prominent targets. 

Motive: Greed, curiosity, risk 

Health: 12 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Balancing, climbing, perception, pickpocketing, and
stealth as level 5 

Combat: Thieves prefer small concealable weapons—knives, batons, and so
on—so they can quickly make themselves look like an innocent bystander.
Their goal is to escape, not kill, so they often rely on tricks like
caltrops, spilled oil, and smoke pellets to distract or delay foes and
give themselves an opportunity to get away. They aren’t above using
poison, typically a sleep poison that knocks out a foe for ten minutes
on a failed Might defense task.

 Interaction: Thieves run a broad range of personalities—nervous,
arrogant, quietly confident, sarcastic, and more. They like to know the
risks and rewards of what they’ll be doing, and they don’t like
surprises. 

Use: A cocky thief steals an item from a character and returns it to
prove their skills are up to the task. A gang of pickpockets targets a
character’s jewelry or cyphers. 

Loot: Thieves usually carry light tools, a few small weapons,
miscellaneous equipment for creating a distraction, and a cypher they
plan to use or sell.

THUG 3 (9)

Thugs are usually rough, crude, and harsh individuals who prey on those
who follow the rules. A thug might be a streetwise drug dealer, a bandit
who hunts lone travelers in the wilds, a savage warrior adroit with
ranged weapons, or a cyberbully among pacifists. Most thugs work for
themselves, but they may employ gangs of guards to help them conduct
their business.

Motive: Take what they want

Health: 9

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short

Combat: Thugs prefer ambushes, making ranged attacks from hiding if
possible. Sometimes they spoil the ambush to issue an ultimatum before
attacking: give us your valuables or you’ll be sorry.

Interaction: Thugs are interested in money and power, which means they
almost always accept bribes. If faced with a real threat, thugs usually
retreat.

Use: Thugs are everywhere, sometimes accompanied by guards who are
equally malicious but not quite as powerful.

Loot: A thug has currency equivalent to an inexpensive item in addition
to weapons, shields, and light armor. One thug in a group might have a
cypher.

GM intrusion: Another thug, hidden until just the right moment, appears
and takes a shot with a ranged weapon before joining the fray.

WIZARD, MIGHTY 8 (24)

Some wizards learn so many spells and accumulate so much lore that they
become incredibly powerful. Some work for a higher purpose, whereas
others are concerned only with themselves.

Motive: Seek powerful sources of magic (to collect or to keep safe)

Health: 40

Damage Inflicted: 8 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: All tasks related to knowledge of arcane lore as level 9

Combat: When a wizard makes a long-range attack with their staff or
strikes someone with it, arcane energy damages the target and, if
desired, all creatures the wizard selects within short range of the
target. Targets that are within immediate range of the wizard when they
take damage are thrown out of immediate range.

A mighty wizard knows many spells, including spells that grant +5 to
Armor for an hour, spells of teleportation, spells of finding, and so
on. A wizard also likely carries several cyphers useful in combat.

Interaction: Care should be taken when negotiating with wizards because
they are subtle and quick to anger. Even when negotiations succeed, a
wizard’s suggestions are usually cryptic and open to interpretation. A
mighty wizard might be convinced to teach a character how to cast a
spell.

Use: A wizard is putting together a team to challenge a great foe, and
the PCs fit the bill.

Loot: A mighty wizard has 1d6 cyphers.

GM intrusion: The wizard casts two spells as a single action instead of
just one.

Cyphers

Cyphers are one-use abilities that characters gain over the course of
play. They have cool powers that can heal, make attacks, ease or hinder
task rolls, or (in a more supernatural and extreme example) produce
effects such as nullifying gravity or turning something invisible.

Most cyphers aren’t physical objects—just something useful that happens
right when you need it. They might be a burst of insight that allows a
character to make a perfectly executed attack, a lucky guess when using
a computer terminal, a coincidental distraction that gives you an
advantage against an NPC, or a supernatural entity that makes things
work out in your favor. In some games, cyphers come in the form of
items, like magic potions or bits of alien technology.

Cyphers that don’t have a physical form are called subtle cyphers.

Cyphers that have a physical form are called manifest cyphers.

Regardless of their form, cyphers are single-use effects and are always
consumed when used. Unless a cypher’s description says otherwise, it
works only for the character who activates it. For example, a PC can’t
use an enduring shield cypher on a friend.

Cyphers are a game mechanic designed for frequent discovery and use. PCs
can have only a small number of cyphers at any given time, and since
they’re always finding more, they’re encouraged to use them at a steady
pace.

In theory, the cyphers gained by the PCs are determined randomly.
However, the GM can allow PCs to acquire or find them intentionally as
well. Cyphers are gained with such regularity that the PCs should feel
that they can use them freely. There will always be more, and they’ll
have different benefits. This means that in gameplay, cyphers are less
like gear or treasure and more like character abilities that the players
don’t choose. This leads to fun game moments where a player can say
“Well, I’ve got an X that might help in this situation,” and X is always
different. X might be an intuitive understanding of the local computer
network, a favor from the Faerie Court, an explosive device, a
short-range teleporter, or a force field. It might be a powerful magnet
or a prayer that will cure disease. It could be anything. Cyphers keep
the game fresh and interesting. Over time, characters can learn how to
safely carry more and more cyphers at the same time, so cyphers really
do seem more like abilities and less like gear.

(“Carry” in this sense refers to both subtle cyphers and manifest
cyphers, though a PC may not actually carry anything that physically
represents the cypher. A character thrown into prison without their
equipment might still have subtle cyphers.)

Cyphers don’t have to be used to make room for new ones. For subtle
cyphers, a character can just use an action to “lose” the cypher,
freeing up space to “find” one later (once a subtle cypher is discarded
this way, it is gone and can’t be recovered). For manifest cyphers, it’s
perfectly acceptable for the PCs to stash one elsewhere for later use;
of course, that doesn’t mean it will still be there when they return.

WHY CYPHERS?

Cyphers are (not surprisingly, based on the name) the heart of the
Cypher System. This is because characters in this game have some
abilities that rarely or never change and can always be counted
on—pretty much like in all games—and they have some abilities that are
ever-changing and inject a great deal of variability in play. They are
the major reason why no Cypher System game session should ever be dull
or feel just like the last session. This week your character can solve
the problem by walking through walls, but last time it was because you
could create an explosion that could level a city block.

The Cypher System, then, is one where PC abilities are fluid, with the
GM and the players both having a role in their choice, their assignment,
and their use. Although many things separate the game system from
others, this aspect makes it unique, because cyphers recognize the
importance and value of two things:

1\. “Treasure,” because character abilities make the game fun and
exciting. In fact, in the early days of roleplaying, treasure (usually
in the form of magic items found in dungeons) was really the only
customization of characters that existed. One of the drives to go out
and have adventures is so you can discover cool new things that help you
when you go on even more adventures. This is true in many RPGs, but in
the Cypher System, it’s built right into the game’s core.

2\. Letting the GM have a hand in determining PC abilities makes the
game move more smoothly. Some GMs prefer  
to roll cyphers randomly, but some do not. For example, giving the PCs a
cypher that will allow them to teleport far away might be a secret
adventure seed placed by a  
forward-thinking GM. Because the GM has an idea of where the story is
going, they can use cyphers to help guide the path. Alternatively, if
the GM is open to it, they can give out cyphers that enable the
characters to take a more proactive role (such as teleporting anywhere
they want). Perhaps most important, they can do these things without
worrying about the long-term ramifications of the ability. A device that
lets you teleport multiple times might really mess up the game over the
long term. But once? That’s just fun.

CYPHER LIMITS

All characters have a maximum number of cyphers they can have at any one
time, determined by their type. If a character ever attempts to carry
more, random cyphers instantly disappear until the PC has a number of
cyphers equal to their maximum (depending on the genre of the campaign,
subtle cyphers may be more or less likely to vanish this way). These
vanished cyphers are not recoverable.

SUBTLE CYPHERS

Subtle (nonphysical) cyphers are a way to introduce cyphers into a game
without overt “powered stuff”—no potions, alien crystals, or anything of
that nature. They’re most useful, perhaps, in a modern or horror setting
without obvious fantasy elements. Subtle cyphers are more like the
inherent abilities PCs have, adding boosts to Edge, recovering points
from Pools, coming up with ideas, and so on. In general, these are
commonplace, non-supernatural effects—a subtle cypher wouldn’t create a
laser beam or allow a character to walk through a wall. They don’t break
the fragile bubble of believability in genres where flashy powers and
abilities don’t make a lot of sense.

Subtle cyphers are particularly nice in a genre where the PCs are
supposed to be normal people. The cyphers can simply be an expression of
innate capabilities in characters that aren’t always dependable. And in
many ways, that’s probably more realistic than an ability you can count
on with certainty, because in real life, some days you can jump over a
fence, and some days you just can’t.

Concepts for subtle cyphers include the following:

Good fortune: Once in a while, things just go your way. You’re in the
right place at the right time.

Inspirations: Sometimes you get inspired to do something you’ve never
done before and might not be able to do again. Call it adrenaline mixed
with the right motivation, or just doing the right thing at the right
place at the right time. Who can really define it? Life’s funny that
way.

Alien concepts: Complex and utterly inhuman memes enter our world and
worm their way into and out of human consciousness. When this happens,
it can cause mental distress and disorientation. It can also grant
impossible abilities and advantages.

Blessings: In a fantasy world, there are nine gods. Each morning, all
intelligent residents of the world pray to one of the gods, and some of
the faithful gain a divine blessing. Some people believe that praying to
different gods gives you different blessings.

Earworms: You know how some songs pop into your head and just won’t
leave? There’s a power to those songs, and the right people know how to
harness it. Make the songs disturbing or reminiscent of evil chants, and
you’ve got a perfect cypher concept for a horror campaign.

Mysterious transmissions: What’s that buzzing? That mechanical
chittering? Those numbers repeating over and over? And why can only some
people hear it? A few who are aware of the sounds have learned how to
make use of them.

Supernatural powers: Mental or mystical energies constantly shift and
change, ebb and flow. But you’ve figured out how to attune your mind to
them. There are no physical actions or paraphernalia required—just an
inner conduit to the numinous.

DISCOVERING SUBTLE CYPHERS

Since subtle cyphers aren’t physical objects, GMs will need to figure
out when to give PCs new ones to replace the ones they have used. The
cyphers probably shouldn’t be tied to actions entirely under the
characters’ control—in other words, they shouldn’t come as a result of
meditation or anything of that nature. Instead, the GM should choose
significant points in the story when new cyphers might simply come
unbidden to the PCs. In the broader view, this is no different than
manifest cyphers placed as treasure in a creature’s lair, a secret
cache, or somewhere else for the characters to find. Either way, the GM
is picking good spots to “refill” potentially used cypher-based
abilities.

Subtle cyphers are often found in groups of one to six (the GM can roll
1d6 to determine the number). The GM might randomly assign the cyphers
to each PC who has space for more, or present a selection of cyphers to
the group and allow the players to choose which ones they want for their
characters. Characters should immediately know what their subtle cyphers
do. If a PC activates a healing subtle cypher when they think it’s
something to help pick a lock, that’s a waste of a useful character
ability.

PCs might be able to obtain subtle cyphers from NPCs or in unusual
circumstances as gifts, boons, or blessings, even asking for a
particular kind of subtle cypher, such as healing, protection, or skill.
For example, PCs who make a donation at a temple of a healing goddess
could ask to receive a blessing (subtle cypher) that allows them to
speak a healing prayer that restores points to one of their Pools. An
NPC wizard who owes the PCs a favor might cast a spell on them that
deflects one weapon if they say a magic word. An alien pylon might grant
knowledge of a strange mental code that lets a person see in the dark
for a few hours.

A PC can also acquire a new subtle cypher by spending 1 XP on one of the
following player intrusions:

General cypher: You ask the GM for a general subtle cypher, such as
“healing,” “movement,” “defense,” or perhaps something as specific as
“flight.” The GM gives you a cypher that meets that description and
randomly determines its level. If you don’t have space for this cypher,
you immediately lose one of your current cyphers (your choice) and the
new cypher takes its place.

Specific cypher: You ask the GM for a specific subtle cypher (such as a
curative or stim) of a specific level. Make an Intellect roll with a
difficulty equal to the cypher’s level plus 1. If you have had this
cypher before, the task is eased. If you fail the roll, you do not gain
a cypher. If you succeed, the GM gives you that subtle cypher at that
level. If you don’t have space for this new cypher, you immediately lose
one of your current cyphers (your choice) and the new cypher takes its
place. Whether or not you succeed at the roll, the 1 XP is spent.

FANTASy CYPHERS

Magic items are a staple of fantasy stories and games. In the Cypher
System, these magic items are, of course, cyphers. The Cypher System
assumes that subtle cyphers are the default, but in a fantasy game the
assumption is usually the opposite—cyphers are physical objects
(manifest cyphers) with magical powers, which the heroes find as
treasure, gifts, or rewards for their adventures and exploits. 

MIXING SUBTLE AND MANIFEST CYPHERS  
There’s no reason why a fantasy campaign can’t use manifest cyphers and
subtle cyphers. In this setup, manifest cyphers are the tangible objects
found in treasure hoards, and subtle cyphers represent good fortune, the
blessings of the gods, and other coincidences that benefit the
characters. 

CYPHER FORMS

What form a manifest cypher takes— such as a potion or scroll—doesn’t
affect its abilities at all. A potion that eases the user’s next task by
three steps is functionally identical to a magical scroll that does the
same thing.

To randomly determine a manifest cypher’s form, roll on the following
table.

ACID RESISTANCE

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Effect: The user gains Armor against acid damage equal to the cypher’s
level for one hour. 

ANIMAL CONTROL 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Effect: To activate the cypher, the user must succeed on an Intellect
attack against a beast whose level does not exceed the cypher’s level.
If successful, the beast immediately becomes calm. The beast awaits the
user’s commands and carries out all orders to the best of its ability.
The target remains so enslaved for a number of hours equal to the
cypher’s level minus the target’s level. (If the result is 0, the target
is enslaved for only one minute.) The beast could attack or defend, a
dog could follow a scent or retrieve an object, a badger could dig a
hole, and so on. 

The cypher doesn’t give the user any special ability to understand the
target or perceive through its senses. For example, the user can command
an eagle to fly above a group of enemies, but the eagle can’t describe
what it sees and the user can’t look through its eyes. 

“Beast” in this sense refers to creatures of animal-level intelligence
and may include unintelligent magical creatures like basilisks, pegasi,
and so on.

BEAST SHAPE 

Level: 1d6 

Effect: The user transforms into a specific kind of animal, such as a
bear, hawk, horse, or wolf (the kind of animal is determined by the
cypher’s creator). The user gains the animal’s type of movement
(swimming for a fish, flying for a bird, and so on) and two assets on
tasks to pretend to be that animal. The user also gains an asset on one
skill appropriate to their animal form (or two skills for cypher level 5
and higher). See the Animal Form Minor Abilities table. 

The magic shrinks or enlarges the user to a size more suitable for their
animal form, but generally can’t make them more than about 50 percent
smaller or larger, so the user might become an unusually large bird or a
small bear. This doesn’t affect the animal’s abilities. The user can
still use all of their abilities that don’t rely specifically on their
normal form. For example, an Adept in wolf form can’t wield a dagger
because wolves don’t have hands, but could still use a healing power or
mind blast ability. 

After about an hour, the user returns to their normal form.

Depending on the cypher, the user might still be able to speak in a
humanoid language, talk in a “language” of animal noises that other
transformed people can understand perfectly, speak with animals of the
same kind, or none of the above.

COLD RESISTANCE 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Effect: The user gains Armor against cold damage equal to the cypher’s
level for one hour. 

DEMON WARD 

Level: 1d6 

Effect: For one hour, the user gains Armor equal to the cypher’s level
against damage from demons, devils, and similar malevolent creatures.

DRAGON WARD 

Level: 1d6 

Effect: For one hour, the user gains Armor equal to the cypher’s level
against damage from dragons, wyverns, and similar magical reptilian
creatures.

In a typical fantasy campaign, a demon is a supernatural being from
another dimension or plane of existence.

ELECTRICITY RESISTANCE 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Effect: The user gains Armor against electricity damage equal to the
cypher’s level for one hour. 

ELEMENTAL CONJURATION 

Level: 1d6 

Effect: Summons an elemental creature (air, earth, fire, or water) that
can understand the verbal commands of the user. Once the elemental is
summoned, commanding it is not an action. It can make attacks or perform
actions as ordered to the best of its abilities, but it cannot speak.
The elemental never goes farther than long range away from the user. 

The elemental is not particularly intelligent or capable of initiating
action. It responds if attacked, but otherwise does only as commanded. 

The elemental remains for one hour per cypher level or until its
physical form is destroyed, after which it vanishes back to its native
realm. 

FIRE RESISTANCE 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Effect: The user gains Armor against fire damage equal to the cypher’s
level for one hour.

GIANT SIZE 

Level: 1d6 

Effect: The user grows to about one and a half times their normal size.
While at this larger size, they add 4 points to their Might Pool and +2
to their Might Edge, but their Speed defense rolls are hindered. 

They return to their normal size after a minute. When the effect ends,
their Might Edge returns to normal, they lose the penalty to Speed
defense, and they subtract 4 points from their Might Pool (if this
brings the Pool to 0, they subtract the overflow first from their Speed
Pool and then, if necessary, from their Intellect Pool). 

If the user is an NPC, the cypher increases their health by 4, eases
their Might-based tasks, and hinders their Speed defense. When the
effect ends, they lose 4 health and all of the other advantages and
penalties from the cypher. 

INSTANT BOAT 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Effect: Creates or transforms into a small sailboat that can carry up to
eight people. The user or other characters must row, steer, and sail the
boat as normal. At cypher level 5 and higher, the boat grants an asset
on all tasks relating to its movement, and at cypher level 7 and higher,
the boat can move a short distance each round under its own power. The
boat lasts for a day, after which it vanishes.

INSTANT TOWER 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Effect: Creates a simple, squat stone tower with a door, three arrow
slits, and a ceiling hatch leading to the roof. The tower is 10 feet (3
m) square and 12 feet (4 m) tall. If the cypher level is 7 or higher,
the tower also has a second story (with four arrow slits), increasing
its total height to 20 feet (6 m). If there isn’t sufficient room for
the tower to reach its full size, it fills the available space, but its
appearance and growth does not apply any force or pressure against the
confining surfaces. 

The tower is permanent and immobile once created. 

LYCANTHROPE WARD 

Level: 1d6 

Effect: For one hour, the user gains Armor equal to the cypher’s level
against damage from werewolves and other lycanthropes. 

Lycanthrope: Formally, a human who can transform into a wolf.
Informally, a human who can transform into an animal, such as a bear,
rat, tiger, or wolf

PENULTIMATE KEY 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Effect: Locks or unlocks any one door, portal, chest, or other lockable
item of the cypher’s level or lower. The targeted item must have a
keyhole for the cypher to work. 

Legends speak of the Ultimate Key, which can open any lock, even those
sealed by a god.

POISON RESISTANCE

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Effect: The user gains Armor against poison damage equal to the cypher’s
level for one hour.

RESTORATIVE AURA 

Level: 1d6 

Effect: Creates an immediate area filled with aromatic smoke, reassuring
sounds, gentle light, or other pleasing sensations that last for one
hour. Creatures who rest within the area gain +2 on their recovery rolls
(or +4 for cypher level 5 and higher). NPCs instead recover 2 health if
they spend at least ten minutes within the area (or 4 health for cypher
level 5 and higher). For a creature to gain this benefit, its entire
rest must occur while the cypher is active. 

THOUGHT LISTENING 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Effect: The user can read the surface thoughts of a creature within
short range that they can see, even if the target doesn’t want them to.
Once the user has established contact, they can read the target’s
thoughts for up to one minute per cypher level.

TINY SIZE 

Level: 1d6 

Effect: The user shrinks to about one-tenth their normal size. While at
this smaller size, they add 4 points to their Speed Pool and +2 to their
Speed Edge, but all of their Might actions are hindered by two steps.
They return to their normal size after a minute. When the effect ends,
their Speed Edge returns to normal, they lose the penalty to Might
actions, and they subtract 4 points from their Speed Pool (if this
brings the Pool to 0, they subtract the overflow first from their
Intellect Pool and then, if necessary, from their Might Pool). 

If the user is an NPC, the cypher eases their Speed-based tasks and
hinders their Might-based tasks. When the effect ends, they lose all of
the advantages and penalties from the cypher. 

UNDEAD WARD 

Level: 1d6 

Effect: For one hour, the user gains Armor equal to the cypher’s level
against damage from skeletons, zombies, ghosts, vampires, and other
undead creatures. 

WALKING CORPSE 

Level: 1d6 

Effect: Animates a corpse as a level 1 (or level 2 for cypher level 5
and higher) undead skeleton or zombie, depending on the condition of the
body. The corpse can be no larger than a typical human. The animated
corpse has none of the intelligence, memories, or special abilities that
it had in life. The creature follows the user’s verbal commands for one
hour, after which it becomes an inert corpse. Unless the creature is
killed by damage, the user can reanimate it again when its time expires,
but any damage it had when it became inert applies to its newly
reanimated state.

MANIFEST CYPHERS

Because manifest cyphers are physical objects, and people are familiar
with the idea of finding “treasure” as part of playing an RPG, these
kinds of cyphers are easy to get into the hands of the PCs. They are
often found in groups of one to six (the GM can roll 1d6 to determine
the number), usually because the characters are searching for them. They
might be among the possessions of a fallen foe, hidden in a secret room,
or scattered amid the wreckage of a crashed starship. The GM can prepare
a list ahead of time of what successful searchers find. Sometimes this
list is random, and sometimes there is logic behind it. For example, a
warlock’s laboratory might contain four different magic potions that the
PCs can find.

If the characters search for cyphers, the GM sets the difficulty of the
task. It is usually 3 or 4, and scavenging can take fifteen minutes to
an hour.

Scavenging is not the only way to obtain manifest cyphers. They can also
be given as gifts, traded with merchants, or sometimes purchased in a
shop.

Unlike subtle cyphers, characters don’t automatically know what manifest
cyphers do. Once the PCs find a manifest cypher, identifying it is a
separate task, based on Intellect and modified by knowledge of the topic
at hand. In a fantasy setting, that knowledge would probably be magic,
but in a science fiction setting, it might be technology. The GM sets
the difficulty of the task, but it is usually 1 or 2. Thus, even the
smallest amount of knowledge means that cypher identification is
automatic. The process takes one to ten minutes. If the PCs can’t
identify a cypher, they can bring it to an expert for identification and
perhaps trade, if desired.

MANIFEST CYPHERS DUPLICATING SUBLE CYPHERS

Lots of overlap exists between what subtle cyphers and manifest cyphers
can do. Nearly anything that can be explained as a subtle cypher can
just as easily be a magic item, scientific device, or other manifest
object. A bit of luck that helps you sneak (a subtle cypher) and a
potion that helps you sneak (a manifest cypher) do the exact same thing
for a character. One advantage of manifest cyphers is that characters
can easily trade them to each other or sell them to NPCs. On the other
hand, manifest cyphers can be dropped or stolen, and subtle cyphers
can’t.

It’s fine if the GM decides to include both kinds of cyphers in the same
game. A horror game could begin with the PCs as normal people with
subtle cyphers, but as time goes on, they find one-use spells in occult
tomes, weird potions, and bone dust that has strange powers.

USING CYPHERS

The action to use a cypher is Intellect based unless described otherwise
or logic suggests otherwise. For example, throwing an explosive might be
Speed based because the device is physical and not really technical, but
using a ray emitter is Intellect based.

Because cyphers are single-use items, cyphers used to make attacks can
never be used with the Spray or Arc Spray abilities that some characters
might have. They are never treated as rapid-fire weapons.

Identified manifest cyphers can be used automatically. Once a manifest
cypher is activated, if it has an ongoing effect, that effect applies
only to the character who activated the cypher. A PC can’t activate a
cypher and then hand it to another character to reap the benefits.

A character can attempt to use a manifest cypher that has not been
identified; this is usually an Intellect task using the cypher’s level.
Failure might mean that the PC can’t figure out how to use the cypher or
that they use it incorrectly (GM’s discretion). Of course, even if the
PC activates the unidentified cypher, they have no idea what its effect
will be.

(Cyphers are meant to be used regularly and often. If PCs are hoarding
or saving their cyphers, feel free to give them a reason to put the
cyphers into play.)

CYPHER LEVELS AND EFFECTS

All cyphers have a level and an effect. The level sometimes determines
an aspect of the cypher’s power (how much damage it inflicts, for
example) but otherwise it only determines the general efficacy, the way
level works with any object. The Level entry for a cypher is usually a
die roll, sometimes with a modifier, such as 1d6 or 1d6 + 4. The GM can
roll to determine the cypher’s level, or can allow the player to roll
when they receive the cypher.

NORMAL AND FANTASTIC EFFECTS

Cypher effects fall into two categories: normal and fantastic. Normal
effects are things that could reasonably happen or be explained in the
normal physical world we’re familiar with. Fantastic effects are things
that can’t. A normal person could hit a target 240 feet (73 m) away with
a football, quickly get over a cold, run across a tightrope, or multiply
two two-digit numbers in their head. These tasks are difficult, but
possible. A normal person can’t throw an armored car, regrow a severed
arm, create a robot out of thin air, or control gravity with their mind.
These tasks are impossible according to the world as we know it. Cypher
effects are either normal (possible) or fantastic (impossible according
to the world as we know it).

Normal cypher effects should be available to PCs regardless of the genre
of your game. It’s perfectly reasonable for a modern, fantasy, horror,
science fiction, or superhero PC to have a cypher that gives them a
one-use bonus on an attack or skill task, lets them take a quick
breather to recover a few points in a Pool, or helps them focus their
will to avoid distractions or fatigue.

Fantastic cypher effects should be limited to games where magic,
technology, or other factors stretch the definition of “impossible.” A
cypher that turns a corpse into a zombie is out of place in a
non-fantastic modern game, but is perfectly reasonable for a fantasy,
science fiction, or superhero game, or even a horror game where zombies
exist, as long as the GM decides there is an appropriate story
explanation for it. The zombie cypher might be a necromantic spell in a
fantasy or superhero game, a code that activates a swarm of nanobots in
a science fiction game, or a virus in a horror game. The rules
categorize some cypher effects as fantastic to help the GM decide
whether to exclude cyphers that don’t fit the game they’re running. For
example, it is appropriate for a GM running a zombie horror survival
game set in 1990s Georgia to allow the zombie-creating cypher but not a
teleportation cypher, because creating a zombie is a fantastic effect
that fits the setting and teleportation isn’t.

Fantastic cyphers can be subtle or manifest.

OPTIONAL RULE: NORMAL CYPHERS DUPLICATING FANTASTIC EFFECTS

If the GM and players are willing to stretch their imaginations a bit,
it’s possible to include some fantastic cypher effects in a game where
only normal cypher effects should exist, even if the PCs are only using
subtle cyphers. The player using the cypher just needs to come up with a
practical, realistic explanation for how the fantastic result occurred
(perhaps with a much shorter or reduced effect than what’s described in
the cypher text).

For example, a PC with a phase changer who is trapped in a prison cell
could say that instead of physically phasing through the wall, using the
cypher means they find a long-forgotten secret door connected to a
narrow hallway leading to safety. A PC with a fire detonation could say
they notice a can of paint thinner in the room, kick it over, and throw
a table lamp into the spill, creating a spark and a momentary burst of
harmful flames. A PC with a monoblade could say they spot structural
flaws in an opponent’s armor, allowing them to attack for the rest of
that combat in such a way that the foe’s Armor doesn’t count.

These interpretations of fantastic cyphers in a non-fantastic setting
require player ingenuity and GM willingness to embrace creative
solutions (similar to players using player intrusions to make a change
in the game world). The GM always has the right to veto the explanation
for the fantastic effect, allowing the player to choose a different
action instead of using the fantastic cypher.

MANIFEST CYPHER FORMS

None of the manifest cyphers in this chapter have a stated physical
form. The entries don’t tell you if something is a potion, a pill, or a
device you hold in your hands because that sort of detail varies greatly
from genre to genre. Are they magic? Are they tech? Are they symbiotic
creatures with programmed DNA? That’s up to the GM. It’s flavor, not
mechanics. It’s as important or unimportant as the style of an NPC’s
hair or the color of the car the bad guys are driving. In other words,
it’s the kind of thing that is important in a roleplaying game, but at
the same time doesn’t actually change anything (and RPGs have a lot of
things like that, if you think about it).

A manifest cypher’s physical form can be anything at all, but there are
some obvious choices based on genre. The GM can design a setting that
uses just one type—for example, a magical world where all cyphers are
potions made by faeries. Or they can use many types, perhaps mixing them
from different genres. Some suggestions include the following.

A LISTING OF VARIOUS CYPHERS

All cyphers in this section may be manifest cyphers. It is the GM’s
discretion whether a particular cypher can be a subtle cypher, and that
decision usually depends on the setting. (The tables indicating subtle,
manifest, and fantastic cyphers are just suggestions for a typical
campaign setting.)

ADHESION

Level: 1d6

Effect: Allows for automatic climbing of any surface, even horizontal
ones. Lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.

AGE TAKER

Level: 1d6 + 4

Effect: Begins a process of rejuvenation that removes years from the
wearer’s physiological age. Over the course of the next seven days, the
wearer sheds a number of years equal to three times the cypher’s level.
The cypher doesn’t regress physiological age past the age of  
twenty-three.

ANALEPTIC

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Restores a number of points equal to the cypher’s level to the
user’s Speed Pool.

ANTIVENOM

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Renders user immune to poisons of the cypher’s level or lower
for one hour per cypher level (and ends any such ongoing effects, if
any, already in the user’s system).

ARMOR REINFORCER

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: The user’s Armor gains an enhancement for twenty-four hours.
Roll a d6 to determine the result.

|     |                                          |
|-----|------------------------------------------|
| 1   | +1 to Armor                              |
| 2   | +2 to Armor                              |
| 3   | +3 to Armor                              |
| 4   | +2 to Armor, +5 against damage from fire |
| 5   | +2 to Armor, +5 against damage from cold |
| 6   | +2 to Armor, +5 against damage from acid |

ATTRACTOR

Level: 1d6 + 4

Effect: One unanchored item the user’s size or smaller within long range
(very long range if the cypher level is 8 or higher) is drawn
immediately to them. This takes one round. The item has no momentum when
it arrives.

BANISHING

Level: 1d6

Effect: For the next day, each time the user strikes a solid creature or
object, it generates a burst of energy that teleports the creature or
object an immediate distance in a random direction (not up or down). The
teleported creature’s actions (including defense) are hindered on its
next turn (hindered by two steps if the cypher level is 5 or higher).

BEST TOOL

Level: 1d6

Effect: Provides an additional asset for any one task using a tool, even
if that means exceeding the normal limit of two assets.

BLACKOUT

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: An area within immediate range of the user becomes secure
against any effect outside the area that sees, hears, or otherwise
senses what occurs inside. To outside observers, the area is a “blur” to
any sense applied. Taps, scrying sensors, and other direct surveillance
methods are also rendered inoperative within the area for a day.

BLINKING

Level: 1d6

Effect: For the next day, each time the user is struck hard enough to
take damage (but not more than once per round), they teleport an
immediate distance in a random direction (not up or down). Since the
user is prepared for this effect and their foe is not, the user’s
defenses are eased for one round after they teleport.

BURST OF SPEED

Level: 1d6

Effect: For one minute, a user who normally can move a short distance as
an action can move a long distance instead.

CATHOLICON

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Cures any disease of the cypher level or lower.

CHEMICAL FACTORY

Level: 1d6

Effect: After one hour, the sweat of the user produces 1d6 doses of a
valuable liquid (these doses are not considered cyphers). They must be
used within one week. Roll a d100 to determine the effect.

| 76–85 | Increases Speed Edge by 1 for one hour                           |
| 86–95 | Increases Intellect Edge by 1 for one hour                       |
| 96–00 | Restores all Pools to full                                       |

COMPREHENSION

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: Within five minutes, the user can understand the words of a
specific language keyed to the cypher (two languages if the cypher is
level 5 or higher). This is true even of creatures that do not normally
have a language. If the user could already understand the language, the
cypher has no effect. Once the cypher is used, the effect is permanent,
and the cypher no longer counts against the number of cyphers that a PC
can bear.

CONDITION REMOVER

Level: 1d6 + 3

Effect: Cures one occurrence of one specific health condition of the
cypher level or lower. It does not prevent the possibility of future
occurrences of the same condition. Roll a d20 to determine what it
cures.

CONTINGENT ACTIVATOR

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: If the device is activated in conjunction with another cypher,
the user can specify a condition under which the linked cypher will
activate. The linked cypher retains the contingent command until it is
used (either normally or contingently). For example, when this cypher is
linked to a cypher that provides a form of healing or protection, the
user could specify that the linked cypher will activate if they become
damaged to a certain degree or are subject to a particular dangerous
circumstance. Until the linked cypher is used, this cypher continues to
count toward the maximum number of cyphers a PC can carry.

CONTROLLED BLINKING

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: For the next day, each time the user is struck hard enough to
inflict damage (but no more than once per round), they teleport to a
spot they desire within immediate range. Since they are prepared for
this effect and their foe is not, the user’s defenses are eased for one
round after they teleport.

CURATIVE

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Restores a number of points equal to the cypher’s level to the
user’s Might Pool.

CURSE BRINGER

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: The cypher can be activated when given to an individual who
doesn’t realize its significance. The next time the victim attempts an
important task when the cypher is in their possession, the task is
hindered by three steps.

DARKSIGHT

Level: 1d6

Effect: Grants the ability to see in the dark for five hours per cypher
level. (For a more realistic game, this cypher could instead make the
user specialized in low-light spotting.)

DEATH BRINGER

Level: 1d6

Effect: For the next minute, when the user strikes an NPC or creature of
the cypher level or lower, they can choose to make a second attack roll.
If the second attack roll is a success, the target is killed. If the
target is a PC, the character instead moves down one step on the damage
track.

DENSITY

Level: 1d6

Effect: For the next day, each time the user strikes a solid creature or
object with a weapon, the weapon suddenly increases dramatically in
weight, causing the blow to inflict 2 additional points of damage.

DETONATION

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Projects a small physical explosive up to a long distance away
that explodes in an immediate radius, inflicting damage equal to the
cypher’s level. Roll a d100 to determine the type of damage.

(All damaging detonations inflict a minimum of 2 points of damage to
those in the radius, regardless of attack or defense rolls.)

DETONATION (CREATURE)

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: Projects a small physical explosive up to a long distance away
that explodes and creates a momentary teleportation gate. A random
creature whose level is equal to or less than the cypher’s level appears
through the gate and attacks the closest target. After about one minute,
the creature vanishes.

DETONATION (DESICCATING)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Projects a small physical explosive up to a long distance away
that bursts in an immediate radius, draining moisture from everything
within it. Living creatures take damage equal to the cypher’s level.
Water in the area is vaporized.

DETONATION (FLASH)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Projects a small physical explosive up to a long distance away
that bursts in an immediate radius, blinding all within it for one
minute (ten minutes if the cypher is level 4 or higher).

DETONATION (GRAVITY)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Projects a small physical explosive up to a long distance away
that bursts in an immediate radius, inflicting damage equal to the
cypher’s level by increasing gravity tremendously for one second. All
creatures in the area are crushed to the ground for one round and cannot
take physical actions.

DETONATION (GRAVITY INVERSION)

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: Projects a small physical explosive up to a long distance away
that explodes, and for one hour gravity reverses within long range of
the explosion.

DETONATION (MASSIVE)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Projects a small physical explosive up to a long distance away
that explodes in a  
short-range radius, inflicting damage equal to the cypher’s level. Roll
a d100 to determine the type of damage.

DETONATION (MATTER DISRUPTION)

Level: 1d6 + 4

Effect: Projects a small physical explosive up to a long distance away
that explodes in an immediate radius, releasing nanites that rearrange
matter in random ways. Inflicts damage equal to the cypher’s level.

DETONATION (PRESSURE)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Projects a small physical explosive up to a long distance away
that explodes in an immediate radius, inflicting impact damage equal to
the cypher’s level. Also moves unattended objects out of the area if
they weigh less than 20 pounds (9 kg) per cypher level.

DETONATION (SINGULARITY)

Level: 10

Effect: Projects a small physical explosive up to a long distance away
that explodes and creates a momentary singularity that tears at the
fabric of the universe. Inflicts 20 points of damage to all within short
range, drawing them (or their remains) together to immediate range (if
possible). Player characters in the radius who fail a Might defense roll
move down one step on the damage track.

(The singularity detonation is a greatly feared device, sought by those
interested in truly horrific destruction.)

DETONATION (SONIC)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Projects a small physical explosive up to a long distance away
that explodes with terrifying sound, deafening all in an immediate
radius for ten minutes per cypher level.

DETONATION (SPAWN)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Projects a small physical explosive up to a long distance away
that bursts in an immediate radius, blinding all within it for one
minute and inflicting damage equal to the cypher’s level. The burst
spawns 1d6 additional detonations; in the next round, each additional
detonation flies to a random spot within short range and explodes in an
immediate radius. Roll a d100 to determine the type of damage dealt by
all detonations:

|       |                                    |
|-------|------------------------------------|
| 01–10 | Cell-disrupting (harms only flesh) |

| 41–50 | Heat drain (cold)                  |
| 51–75 | Fire                               |
| 76–00 | Shrapnel                           |

DETONATION (WEB)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Projects a small physical explosive up to a long distance away
that explodes in an immediate radius and creates sticky strands of goo.
PCs caught in the area must use a Might-based action to get out, with
the difficulty determined by the cypher level. NPCs break free if their
level is higher than the cypher level.

(Rather than strands of sticky goo, some web detonations fill the area
with a mass of quick-hardening foam that has the same result.)

DISARM

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: One NPC within immediate range whose level is lower than the
cypher level drops whatever they are holding.

DISGUISE MODULE

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: For the next ten minutes per cypher level, the user’s features
become almost identical to those of one designated person they have
previously interacted with, easing by two steps attempts to disguise the
user as that person. Once designated, the user cannot shift the effect
to look like another person, though they can remove the module to look
like themselves again before the end of the duration.

DISRUPTING

Level: 1d6

Effect: For the next day, each time the user strikes a solid creature or
object, the attack generates a burst of nanites that directly attack its
organic cells. The target takes 1 additional point of damage. If the
target’s level is less than the cypher’s level, it loses its next
action; otherwise its next action is hindered.

EAGLESEYE

Level: 1d6

Effect: Grants the ability to see ten times as far as normal for one
hour per cypher level. (For a more realistic game, the eagleseye cypher
could instead give the user two assets on tasks involving seeing to long
distances.)

EFFECT RESISTANCE

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: Provides a chance for additional resistance to directly damaging
effects of all kinds, such as fire, lightning, and the like, for one
day. (It does not provide resistance to blunt force, slashing, or
piercing attacks.) If the level of the effect is of the cypher level or
lower, the user gains an additional defense roll to avoid it. On a
successful defense roll, treat the attack as if the user had succeeded
on their regular defense roll. (If the user is an NPC, a PC attacking
them with this kind of effect must succeed on two attack rolls to harm
them.)

EFFORT ENHANCER (COMBAT)

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: For the next hour, the user can apply one free level of Effort
to any task (including a combat task) without spending points from a
Pool. The free level of Effort provided by this cypher does not count
toward the maximum amount of Effort a character can normally apply to
one task. Once this free level of Effort is used, the effect of the
cypher ends.

EFFORT ENHANCER (NONCOMBAT)

Level: 1d6

Effect: For the next hour, the user can apply one free level of Effort
to a noncombat task without spending points from a Pool. The level of
Effort provided by this cypher does not count toward the maximum amount
of Effort a character can normally apply to one task. Once this free
level of Effort is used, the effect of the cypher ends.

ENDURING SHIELD

Level: 1d6 + 4

Effect: For the next day, the user has an asset to Speed defense rolls.

EQUIPMENT CACHE

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: The user can rummage around and produce from the cypher a
desired piece of equipment (not an artifact) whose level does not exceed
the cypher’s level. The piece of equipment persists for up to one day,
unless its fundamental nature allows only a single use (such as with a
grenade).

FARSIGHT

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: The user can observe a location they have visited previously,
regardless of how far away it is (even across galaxies). This vision
persists for up to ten minutes per cypher level. The character can
switch between viewing this location and viewing their current location
once per round.

FIREPROOFING

Level: 1d6 + 4

Effect: A nonliving object treated by this cypher has Armor against fire
damage equal to the cypher’s level for one day.

FLAME-RETARDANT WALL

Level: 1d6

Effect: Creates an immobile plane of permeable energy up to 20 feet by
20 feet (6 m by 6 m) for one hour per cypher level. The plane conforms
to the space available. Flames passing through the plane are
extinguished.

FORCE CUBE

Level: 1d6 + 3

Effect: Creates an immobile cube composed of six planes of solid force,
each 30 feet (9 m) to a side, for one hour. The planes conform to the
space available. (Although a force cube’s walls are not gaseous
permeable, there is likely enough air within for trapped creatures to
breathe for the hour it lasts.)

FORCE FIELD

Level: 1d6

Effect: For the next day, the user is surrounded  
by a powerful force field, granting them +1  
to Armor (+2 to Armor if the cypher level is  
5 or higher).

(Some force walls, shields, and cubes are transparent. Others are
translucent. A few are opaque.)

FORCE SCREEN PROJECTOR

Level: 1d6 + 3

Effect: Creates an immobile plane of solid force up to 20 feet by 20
feet (6 m by 6 m) for one hour. The plane conforms to the space
available.

FORCE SHIELD PROJECTOR

Level: 1d6 + 3

Effect: Creates a shimmering energy shield around the user for one hour,
during which time they gain +3 to Armor (or +4 to Armor if the cypher is
level 5 or higher).

FRICTION REDUCER

Level: 1d6

Effect: Spread across an area up to 10 feet (3 m) square, this makes
things extremely slippery. For one hour per cypher level, movement tasks
in the area are hindered by three steps.

FRIGID WALL

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Creates a wall of supercooled air up to 30 feet by 30 feet by 1
foot (9 m by 9 m by 30 cm) that inflicts damage equal to the cypher’s
level on anything that passes through it. The wall conforms to the space
available. It lasts for ten minutes.

GAS BOMB

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Thrown a short distance, this bursts in a poisonous cloud within
an immediate area. The cloud lingers for 1d6 rounds unless conditions
dictate otherwise. Roll a d100 to determine the effect.

|       |                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01–10 | Thick smoke: occludes sight while the cloud lasts.                                                                                                                      |
| 11–20 | Choking gas: living creatures that breathe lose their actions to choking and coughing for a number of rounds equal to the cypher’s level.                               |
| 21–50 | Poison gas: living creatures that breathe suffer damage equal to the cypher’s level.                                                                                    |
| 51–60 | Corrosive gas: everything suffers damage equal to the cypher’s level.                                                                                                   |
| 61–65 | Hallucinogenic gas: living creatures that breathe lose their actions to hallucinations and visions for a number of rounds equal to the cypher’s level.                  |
| 66–70 | Nerve gas: living creatures that breathe suffer Speed damage equal to the cypher’s level.                                                                               |
| 71–80 | Mind-numbing gas: living creatures that breathe suffer Intellect damage equal to the cypher’s level.                                                                    |
| 81–83 | Fear gas: living creatures that breathe and think flee in a random direction in fear (or are paralyzed with fear) for a number of rounds equal to the cypher’s level.   |
| 84–86 | Amnesia gas: living creatures that breathe and think permanently lose all memory of the last minute.                                                                    |
| 87–96 | Sleep gas: living creatures that breathe fall asleep for a number of rounds equal to the cypher’s level or until awoken by a violent action or an extremely loud noise. |
| 97–00 | Rage gas: living creatures that breathe and think make a melee attack on the nearest creature and continue to do so for a number of rounds equal to the cypher’s level. |

GRAVITY NULLIFIER

Level: 1d6 + 3

Effect: For one hour, the user can float into the air, moving vertically
up to a short distance per round (but not horizontally without taking
some other action, such as pushing along the ceiling). The user must
weigh less than 50 pounds (23 kg) per level of the cypher.

GRAVITY-NULLIFYING APPLICATION

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: If a nonliving object no larger than a human (two humans if the
cypher level is 6 or higher) is coated by this cypher, it floats 1d20
feet in the air permanently and no longer has weight if carried (though
it needs to be strapped down).

HEAT ATTACK

Level: 1d6

Effect: For the next day, each time the user strikes a solid creature or
object, the attack generates a burst of heat that inflicts 2 additional
points of damage.

HUNTER/SEEKER

Level: 1d6

Effect: With long-range movement, this intelligent missile tracks and
attacks a specified target (target must be within sight when selected).
If it misses, it continues to attack one additional time per cypher
level until it hits. For example, a level 4  
hunter/seeker will attack a maximum of five times. Roll a d100 to
determine the type of attack.

|       |                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01–50 | Inflicts 8 points of damage.                                                                                                                                    |
| 51–80 | Bears a poisoned needle that inflicts 3 points of damage plus poison.                                                                                           |
| 81–90 | Explodes, inflicting 6 points of damage to all within immediate range.                                                                                          |
| 91–95 | Shocks for 4 points of electricity damage, and stuns for one round per cypher level.                                                                            |
| 96–00 | Covers target in sticky goo that immediately hardens, holding them fast until they break free with a Might action (difficulty equal to the cypher’s level + 2). |

IMAGE PROJECTOR

Level: 1d6

Effect: Projects one of the following immobile images in the area
described for one hour. The image appears up to a close distance from
the user (long distance if the cypher level is 4 or higher, very long
distance if the cypher level is 6 or higher). Scenes include movement,
sound, and smell. Roll a d100 to determine the image.

INFERNO WALL

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Creates a wall of extreme heat up to 30 feet by 30 feet by 1
foot (9 m by 9 m by 30 cm) that inflicts damage equal to the cypher’s
level on anything that passes through it. The wall conforms to the space
available. It lasts for ten minutes.

INFILTRATOR

Level: 1d6

Effect: Tiny capsule launches and moves at great speed, mapping and
scanning an unknown area. It moves 500 feet (150 m) per level, scanning
an area up to 50 feet (15 m) per level away from it. It identifies basic
layout, creatures, and major energy sources and either transmits this
information back to the user (perhaps by telepathy or an electronic
signal) or returns to the user to show what it saw. Its movement is
blocked by any physical or energy barrier.

INFORMATION SENSOR

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Over the course of one day, the user can activate the cypher a
total number of times equal to its level. Each time, they can select a
living creature within long range and learn the following about it:
level, origin, species, name, and possibly other facts (such as an
individual’s credit score, home address, phone number, and related
information).

INSTANT SERVANT

Level: 1d6

Effect: Small device expands into a humanoid automaton that is roughly 2
feet (60 cm) tall. Its level is equal to the cypher’s level, and it can
understand the verbal commands of the character who activated it. Once
the servant is activated, commanding it is not an action. It can make
attacks or perform actions as ordered to the best of its abilities, but
it cannot speak.

The automaton has short-range movement but never goes farther than long
range from the character who activated it. At the GM’s discretion, the
servant might have specialized knowledge, such as how to operate a
particular device. Otherwise, it has no special knowledge. In any case,
the servant is not artificially intelligent or capable of initiating
action. It does only as commanded.

The servant operates for one hour per cypher level.

INSTANT SHELTER

Level: 1d6 + 3

Effect: With the addition of water and air, this cypher expands into a
simple one-room structure with a door and a transparent window (two
rooms with an internal door if the cypher level is 7 or higher). The
structure is 10 feet by 10 feet by 20 feet (3 m by 3 m by 6 m). It is
made from a durable, nonflammable material similar to sandstone, and is
permanent and immobile once created.

INTELLECT BOOSTER

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Adds 1 to the user’s Intellect Edge for one hour (or 2 if the
cypher is level 5 or higher).

INTELLIGENCE ENHANCEMENT

Level: 1d6

Effect: All of the user’s tasks involving intelligent deduction—such as
playing chess, inferring a connection between clues, solving a
mathematical problem, finding a bug in computer code, and so on—are
eased by two steps for one hour. In the subsequent hour, the strain
hinders the same tasks by two steps.

KNOWLEDGE ENHANCEMENT

Level: 1d6

Effect: For the next day, the character has training in a predetermined
skill (or two skills if the cypher is level 5 or higher). The skill
could be anything (including something specific to the operation of a
particular device), or roll a d100 to choose a common skill. (It is easy
to get addicted to the quick hit of training that comes from knowledge
enhancement cyphers. Characters who rely on them too often may find
themselves at a disadvantage when they run out, presenting a great
opportunity for GM intrusion.)

LIGHTNING WALL

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Creates a wall of electric bolts up to 30 feet by 30 feet by 1
foot (9 m by 9 m by 30 cm) that inflicts damage equal to the cypher’s
level on anything that passes through it. The wall conforms to the space
available. It lasts for ten minutes.

MACHINE CONTROL

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Splits into two pieces; one is affixed to a device and the other
to a character. The character can then use their mind to control the
device at long range, bidding it to do anything it could do normally.
Thus, a device could be activated or deactivated, and a vehicle could be
piloted. The control lasts for ten minutes per cypher level, and once
the device is chosen, it cannot be changed.

MAGNETIC ATTACK DRILL

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: The user throws this cypher at a target within short range, and
it drills into the target for one round, inflicting damage equal to the
cypher’s level. If the target is made of metal or wearing metal (such as
armor), the attack is eased.

MAGNETIC MASTER

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Establishes a connection with one metal object within short
range that a human could hold in one hand. The user can then move or
manipulate the object anywhere within short range (each movement or
manipulation is an action). For example, they could wield a weapon or
drag a helm affixed to a foe’s head to and fro. The connection lasts for
ten rounds per cypher level.

MAGNETIC SHIELD

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: For ten minutes per cypher level, metal objects cannot come
within immediate range of the user. Metal items already in the area when
the device is activated are slowly pushed out.

MANIPULATION BEAM

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Over the course of one day, the user can activate the cypher a
total number of times equal to its level. Each time, they can affect an
object they can see within long range that is not too heavy for them to
affect physically. The effect must occur over the course of a round and
could include closing or opening a door, keying in a number on a keypad,
transferring an object a short distance, wresting an object from another
creature’s grasp (on a successful Might-based roll), or pushing a
creature an immediate distance. (A manipulation beam could be used to
operate a computer at a distance, which would make some infiltration and
hacking jobs easier.)

MATTER TRANSFERENCE RAY

Level: 1d6 + 3

Effect: The user can target one nonliving object within long range that
is their size or smaller of the cypher level or lower. The object is
transferred directly to a random location at least 100 miles (160 km)
away. If the GM feels it appropriate to the circumstances, only a
portion of an object is transferred (a portion whose volume is no more
than the user’s).

MEDITATION AID

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Restores a number of points equal to the cypher’s level to the
user’s Intellect Pool.

MEMORY SWITCH

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: The user selects a point within long range, and the minds of all
thinking creatures within immediate range of that point are attacked.
Victims are dazed and take no action for a round, and they have no
memory of the preceding hour.

MENTAL SCRAMBLER

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Two rounds after being activated, the device creates an
invisible field that fills an area within short range and lasts for one
minute. The field scrambles the mental processes of all thinking
creatures. The effect lasts as long as they remain in the field and for
1d6 rounds after, although an Intellect defense roll is allowed each
round to act normally (both in the field and after leaving it). Each
mental scrambler is keyed to a specific effect. Roll a d100 to determine
the effect.

|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01–30 | Victims cannot act.                                                                |
| 31–40 | Victims cannot speak.                                                              |
| 41–50 | Victims move slowly (immediate range) and clumsily.                                |
| 51–60 | Victims cannot see or hear.                                                        |
| 61–70 | Victims lose all sense of direction, depth, and proportion.                        |
| 71–80 | Victims do not recognize anyone they know.                                         |
| 81–88 | Victims suffer partial amnesia.                                                    |
| 89–94 | Victims suffer total amnesia.                                                      |
| 95–98 | Victims lose all inhibitions, revealing secrets and performing surprising actions. |
| 99–00 | Victims’ ethics are inverted.                                                      |

METAL DEATH

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Produces a stream of foam that covers an area about 3 feet by 3
feet (1 m by 1 m), transforming any metal that it touches into a
substance as brittle as thin glass. The foam affects metal to a depth of
about 6 inches (15 cm).

MIND MELD

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: Lets the user speak telepathically with creatures they can see
within short range for up to one hour. The user can’t read a target’s
thoughts, except those that are specifically “transmitted.”

(In some games, telepathy transcends normal language barriers (if the
target has a mind that allows for telepathic communication). In others,
it might only pick up emotions or general concepts of thoughts in
another language. It also might vary based on the ability used.)

MIND-RESTRICTING WALL

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Creates an immobile plane of permeable energy up to 20 feet by
20 feet (6 m by 6 m) for one hour. The plane conforms to the space
available. Intelligent creatures passing through the plane fall
unconscious for up to one hour, or until slapped awake or damaged.

MIND STABILIZER

Level: 1d6

Effect: The user gains +5 to Armor against Intellect damage.

MONOBLADE

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Produces a 6-inch (15 cm) blade that’s the same level as the
cypher. The blade cuts through any material of a level lower than its
own. If used as a weapon, it is a light weapon that ignores Armor of a
level lower than its own. The blade lasts for ten minutes.

MONOHORN

Level: 1d6 + 3

Effect: The user gains a horn in the center of their forehead. The horn
is deadly sharp and strong, and it spirals down to a solid base where it
fuses with their flesh and bone. The user is specialized in making melee
attacks with the horn, which is considered a medium weapon. The horn
lasts for a number of hours equal to the cypher’s level.

(Sometimes a monohorn cypher covers the user in a thin sheen of black
hide-like material, which disguises their identity but doesn’t interfere
with their senses.)

MOTION SENSOR

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: For one hour per cypher level, the user knows when any movement
occurs within short range, and when large creatures or objects move
within long range (the cypher distinguishes between the two). It also
indicates the number and size of the creatures or objects in motion.

NULL FIELD

Level: 1d6 + 3

Effect: The user and all creatures within immediate range gain +3 to
Armor (+5 if the cypher is level 8 or higher) against damage of a
specified kind for one hour. Roll a d100 to determine the effect.

|       |                       |
|-------|-----------------------|
| 01–12 | Fire                  |
| 13–27 | Cold                  |
| 28–39 | Acid                  |
| 40–52 | Psychic               |
| 53–65 | Sonic                 |
| 66–72 | Electrical            |
| 73–84 | Poison                |
| 85–95 | Blunt force           |
| 96–00 | Slashing and piercing |

NULLIFICATION RAY

Level: 1d6 + 3

Effect: The user can immediately end one ongoing effect within long
range that is produced by an artifact, cypher, or special ability.

NUTRITION AND HYDRATION

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: The user can go without food and water for a number of days
equal to the cypher’s level without ill effect.

PERFECT MEMORY

Level: 1d6

Effect: Allows the user to mentally record everything they see for
thirty seconds per cypher level and store the recording permanently in
their long-term memory. This cypher is useful for watching someone pick
a specific lock, enter a complex code, or do something else that happens
quickly.

PERFECTION

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: The user treats their next action as if they had rolled a
natural 20.

PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT FIELD

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Creates an aura of temperature and atmosphere that will sustain
a human safely for a day. The aura extends to 1 foot (30 cm) around the
user (double that radius if the cypher is level 7 or higher). It does
not protect against sudden flashes of temperature change (such as from a
heat ray). A small number of these cyphers (1%) accommodate the
preferred environment of a nonhuman, nonterrestrial creature.

PHASE CHANGER

Effect: Puts the user out of phase for one minute (two minutes if the
cypher is level 6 or higher). During this time, they can pass through
solid objects as though they were entirely insubstantial, like a ghost.
They cannot make physical attacks or be physically attacked.

PHASE DISRUPTOR

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Puts a portion of a physical structure (like a wall or floor)
out of phase for one hour. It affects an area equal to one 5-foot (1.5
m) cube per cypher level. While the area is out of phase, creatures and
objects can pass through it as if it were not there, although one cannot
see through it, and it blocks light.

POISON (EMOTION)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: The victim feels a specific emotion for one hour. Roll a d100 to
determine the emotion.

(Most poisons are not considered cyphers, except for a very few that are
unique.)

|       |                                                                                                                                 |

| 41–60 | Lust. Cannot focus on any nonsexual activity.                                                                                   |
| 61–75 | Sadness. All tasks are hindered.                                                                                                |
| 76–85 | Complacency. Has no motivation. All tasks are hindered by two steps.                                                            |
| 86–95 | Joy. Easy to interact with in a pleasant manner; all pleasant interaction tasks are eased.                                      |
| 96–00 | Love. Much easier to interact with; all interaction tasks are eased by two steps, but temporary attachment is likely.           |

POISON (EXPLOSIVE)

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: Once this substance enters the bloodstream, it travels to the
brain and reorganizes into an explosive that detonates when activated,
inflicting 10 points of damage (ignores Armor). Roll a d100 to determine
what activates the poison.

|       |                                                                        |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01–25 | The detonator is activated (must be within long range).                |
| 26–40 | A specified amount of time passes.                                     |
| 41–50 | The victim takes a specific action.                                    |
| 51–55 | A specific note is sung or played on an instrument within short range. |
| 56–60 | The victim smells a specific scent within immediate range.             |
| 61–80 | The victim comes within long range of the detonator.                   |
| 81–00 | The victim is no longer within long range of the detonator.            |

POISON (MIND CONTROLLING)

POISON (MIND DISRUPTING)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: The victim suffers Intellect damage equal to the cypher’s level
and cannot take actions for a number of rounds equal to the cypher’s
level.

PSYCHIC COMMUNIQUE

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Allows the user to project a one-time,  
one-way telepathic message of up to ten words per cypher level, with an
unlimited range, to anyone they know.

RADIATION SPIKE

Level: 1d6 + 4

Effect: Delivers a powerful burst of radiation that disrupts the tissue
of any creature touched, inflicting damage equal to the cypher’s level.

RAY EMITTER

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Allows the user to project a ray of destructive energy up to
very long range that inflicts damage equal to the cypher’s level. Roll a
d100 to determine the type of energy.

(Even weirder ray emitters:

\* Turns target inside out

\* Inflicts damage and turns flesh blue

\* Renders target mute

\* Damages only plants

\* Damages only inorganic matter

\* Turns flesh to dead, stonelike material)

|       |                           |

| 81–87 | Magnetic wave             |
| 88–93 | Molecular bond disruption |
| 94–00 | Concentrated cold         |

RAY EMITTER (COMMAND)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Allows the user to project a ray up to long range (very long
range if the cypher is level 6 or higher) that forces a target to obey
the next verbal command given (if it is understood) for one round per
cypher level.

RAY EMITTER (FEAR)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Allows the user to project a ray up to long range (very long
range if the cypher is level 6 or higher) that causes the target to flee
in terror for one minute.

RAY EMITTER (FRIEND SLAYING)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Allows the user to project a ray up to long range (very long
range if the cypher is level 6 or higher) that causes the target to
attack its nearest ally for one round.

RAY EMITTER (MIND DISRUPTING)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Allows the user to project a ray of destructive energy up to
very long range that inflicts Intellect damage equal to the cypher’s
level. Also, the victim cannot take actions for a number of rounds equal
to the cypher’s level.

RAY EMITTER (NUMBING)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Allows the user to project a ray of energy up to long range
(very long range if the cypher is level 6 or higher) that numbs one limb
of the target, making it useless for one minute. A small number of these
devices (5%) induce numbness that lasts for one hour.

RAY EMITTER (PARALYSIS)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Allows the user to project a ray of energy up to very long range
that paralyzes the target for one minute. A small number of these
devices (5%) induce paralysis that lasts for one hour.

REALITY SPIKE

Level: 1d6 + 4

Effect: Once activated, the cypher does not move—ever—even if activated
in midair. A Might action will dislodge it, but then it is ruined.

REFLEX ENHANCER

Level: 1d6

Effect: All tasks involving manual dexterity—such as pickpocketing,
lockpicking, juggling, operating on a patient, defusing a bomb, and so
on—are eased by two steps for one hour.

REJUVENATOR

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Restores a number of points equal to the cypher’s level to one
random stat Pool.

|       |                |
|-------|----------------|
| 01–50 | Might Pool     |
| 51–75 | Speed Pool     |
| 76–00 | Intellect Pool |

REMEMBERING

Level: 1d6

Effect: Allows the user to recall any one experience they’ve ever had.
The experience can be no longer than one minute per cypher level, but
the recall is perfect, so (for example) if they saw someone dial a
phone, they will remember the number.

REMOTE VIEWER

Level: 1d6

Effect: For one hour per cypher level, the user can see everything going
on in the vicinity of the cypher, regardless of the distance between
them.

REPAIR UNIT

Level: 1d10

Effect: The cypher becomes a multiarmed sphere that floats. It repairs
one designated item (of its own level or lower) that has been damaged
but not destroyed. The repair unit can also create spare parts, unless
the GM rules that the parts are too specialized or rare (in which case,
the unit repairs the device except for the specialized part). Repair
time is 1d100 + 20 minutes.

REPEATER

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: For the next minute, the user’s ranged weapon fires one
additional time with ammo fabricated by the cypher. The weapon wielder
can aim the free shot at the same target, or at a different target next
to the first one.

REPEL

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: One NPC within immediate range who is of a level lower than the
cypher decides to leave, using their next five rounds to move away
quickly.

RETALIATION

Level: 1d6

Effect: For the next day, anyone striking the user receives a small
burst of electricity that inflicts 1 point of damage (2 points if the
cypher is level 4 or higher, 3 points if the cypher is level 6 or
higher). No action or roll is required by the user.

SECRET

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: The user can ask the GM one question and get a general answer.
The GM assigns a level to the question, so the more obscure the answer,
the more difficult the task. Generally, knowledge that a PC could find
by looking somewhere other than their current location is level 1, and
obscure knowledge of the past is level 7. Gaining knowledge of the
future is level 10, and such knowledge is always open to interpretation.
The cypher cannot provide an answer to a question above its level.

SHEEN

Level: 1d6

Effect: For one week, the user’s cells are coated with a protective
veneer that resists damage (+1 to Armor, or +2 to Armor if the cypher is
level 5 or higher) and eases Might defense rolls by two steps. However,
healing is more difficult during this time; all recovery rolls suffer a
–1 penalty.

SHOCK ATTACK

Level: 1d6

Effect: For the next day, each time the user strikes a solid creature or
object, the attack generates a burst of electricity, inflicting 1
additional point of damage (2 points if the cypher is level 4 or higher,
3 points if the cypher is level 6 or higher).

SHOCKER

Level: 1d6 + 4

Effect: Delivers a powerful burst of electricity that shocks any
creature touched, inflicting damage equal to the cypher’s level.

SKILL BOOST

Level: 1d6

Effect: Dramatically but temporarily alters the user’s mind and body so
they can ease one specific kind of physical action by three steps. Once
activated, this boost can be used a number of times equal to the
cypher’s level, but only within a twenty-four-hour period. The boost
takes effect each time the action is performed. For example, a level 3
cypher boosts the first three times that action is attempted. Roll a
d100 to determine the action.

|       |                   |
|-------|-------------------|
| 01–15 | Melee attack      |
| 16–30 | Ranged attack     |

| 99    | Carrying          |
| 00    | Escaping          |

SLAVE MAKER

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: To activate the cypher, the user must succeed on a melee attack
against a creature about the size of the user and whose level does not
exceed the cypher’s level. The cypher bonds to the target, who
immediately becomes calm. The target awaits the user’s commands and
carries out all orders to the best of its ability. The target remains so
enslaved for a number of hours equal to the cypher’s level minus the
target’s level. (If the result is 0, the target is enslaved for only one
minute.)

SLEEP INDUCER

Level: 1d6

Effect: Touch puts the victim to sleep for ten minutes per cypher level
or until awoken by a violent action or an extremely loud noise.

SNIPER MODULE

Level: 1d6

Effect: For the next hour per cypher level, the effective range of the
user’s ranged weapon increases by one category (immediate to short,
short to long, long to very long, very long to 1,000 feet \[300 m\]). A
weapon with a range greater than very long has its range doubled.

SOLVENT

Level: 1d10

Effect: Dissolves 1 cubic foot of material each round. After one round
per cypher level, the cypher becomes inert.

SONIC HOLE

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Draws all sound within long range into the device for one round
per cypher level. Within the affected area, no sound can be heard.

(Sonic holes are much-loved by thieves everywhere but can also be used
for less nefarious purposes, such as hunting prey and sneaking past
enemies.)

SOUND DAMPENER

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Dampens all sound within immediate range for one minute per
cypher level, providing an asset on stealth actions by all creatures in
the area.

SPATIAL WARP

Level: 1d6 + 4

Effect: When affixed to a device that affects a single target at range,
that range is increased to 1 mile (1.5 km) with no penalties. Space is
temporarily warped in terms of seeing and reaching the target. If direct
line of sight is important to the device’s effect, it remains important.
The spatial warp lasts 10 minutes per cypher level.

SPEED BOOST

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Adds 1 to the user’s Speed Edge for one hour (adds 2 if the
cypher is level 5 or higher).

SPY

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Produces a tiny spying object that resists detection as a level
8 creature. The object moves at great speed, mapping and scanning an
unknown area. It moves 500 feet (150 m) per level, scanning an area up
to 50 feet (15 m) away from it. It identifies basic layout, creatures,
and major energy sources. Its movement is blocked by any physical or
energy barrier. At the end of its mapping run, it returns to the user
and reports. If it discovers a predefined target during its run (such as
“a creature of level 5 or higher,” “a locked door,” “a major energy
source,” and so on), it detonates instead, dealing damage equal to the
cypher’s level (half electrical damage, half shrapnel damage) to all
creatures and objects in short range.

STASIS KEEPER

Level: 1d6

Effect: Puts a subject into stasis for a number of days equal to the
cypher’s level, or until it is violently disturbed. An object in stasis
does not age and comes out of the stasis alive and in the same condition
as it went in, with no memory of the period of inactivity.

STIM

Level: 1d6

Effect: Eases the user’s next action taken by three steps.

STRENGTH BOOST

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Adds 1 to Might Edge for one hour (or 2 if the cypher is level 5
or higher).

STRENGTH ENHANCER

Level: 1d6

Effect: All noncombat tasks involving raw strength—such as breaking down
a door, lifting a heavy boulder, forcing open elevator doors, competing
in a weightlifting competition, and so on—are eased by two steps for one
hour.

SUBDUAL FIELD

Level: 1d6 + 3

Effect: Two rounds after being activated, the device creates an
invisible field that fills a specified area (such as a cube a short
distance across) within long range. The field lasts for one minute. It
affects the minds of thinking beings within the field, preventing them
from taking hostile actions. The effect lasts as long as they remain in
the field and for 1d6 rounds after, although an Intellect defense roll
is allowed each round to act normally (both in the field and after
leaving it).

TELEPATHY

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: For one hour, the device enables  
long-range mental communication with anyone the user can see.

TELEPORTER (BOUNDER)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: User teleports up to 100 <span dir="rtl">×</span> the cypher
level in feet to a location they can see. They arrive safely with their
possessions but cannot take anything else with them.

TELEPORTER (INTERSTELLAR)

Level: 1d6 + 4

Effect: User teleports anywhere in the galaxy to a location they have
previously visited or seen. They arrive safely with their possessions
but cannot take anything else with them.

TELEPORTER (PLANETARY)

Level: 1d6 + 4

Effect: User teleports anywhere on the planet to a location they have
previously visited or seen. They arrive safely with their possessions
but cannot take anything else with them.

TELEPORTER (TRAVELER)

Level: 1d6 + 4

Effect: User teleports up to 100 <span dir="rtl">×</span> the cypher
level in miles to a location they have previously visited or seen. They
arrive safely with their possessions but cannot take anything else with
them.

TEMPORAL VIEWER

Level: 1d6 + 4

Effect: Displays moving images and sound, up to ten minutes per cypher
level in length, depicting events that occurred at the current location
up to one year prior. The user specifies the time period shown by the
viewer.

TIME DILATION (DEFENSIVE)

Level: 1d6

Effect: For the next twenty-four hours, when the user is attacked, they
move in rapid, seemingly random jumps, a few inches to one side or the
other. This is an asset that modifies the user’s defense rolls by two
steps (three steps if the cypher is level 6 or higher).

TIME DILATION (OFFENSIVE)

Level: 1d6

Effect: For the next twenty-four hours, when the user makes a melee
attack, they move at almost instantaneous speed, easing their attacks by
two steps (three steps if the cypher is level 6 or higher).

TISSUE REGENERATION

Level: 1d6 + 4

Effect: For the next hour, the user regains 1 point lost to damage per
round, up to a total number of points equal to twice the cypher’s level.
As each point is regained, they choose which Pool to add it to. If all
their Pools are at maximum, the regeneration pauses until they take more
damage, at which point it begins again (if any time remains in the hour)
until the duration expires.

(A tissue regeneration cypher can be used to regenerate a lost appendage
(an arm, a foot, a leg, and so on) or to repair scar tissue from burns
and other tissue-related disfigurements. If the cypher is used in this
fashion, it restores only 1d6 points over the hour duration.)

TRACER

Level: 1d6

Effect: Fires a microscopic tracer that clings to any surface within
short range. For the next twenty-four hours, the launcher shows the
distance and direction to the tracer, as long as it is within 1 mile
(100 miles if the cypher is level 3 or higher, in the same dimension if
the cypher is level 6 or higher).

TRICK EMBEDDER

Level: 1d6

Effect: A nonintelligent animal immediately and perfectly learns one
trick (two tricks if the cypher is level 4 or higher) it is capable of
physically performing (roll over, heel, spin, shake, go to an indicated
place within long range, and so on). The trick must be designated when
the cypher is activated.

UNINTERRUPTIBLE POWER SOURCE

Level: 1d6 + 4

Effect: Provides power to another device for  
up to a day. The device to be powered  
can be as simple as a light source or as  
complex as a small starcraft, assuming the  
cypher’s level is equal to the item’s power  
requirements. A desk lamp is a level 1  
power requirement, a car engine is a level  
5 power requirement, and a starship is a level 10 power requirement.

VANISHER

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: The user becomes invisible for five minutes per cypher level,
during which time they are specialized in stealth and Speed defense
tasks. This effect ends if they do something to reveal their presence or
position—attacking, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on.
If this occurs, they can regain the remaining invisibility effect by
taking an action to focus on hiding their position.

VISAGE CHANGER

Level: 1d6

Effect: Changes the appearance of one  
human-sized creature, providing an asset to disguise tasks (easing them
by two steps if the cypher is level 5 or higher). The change takes ten
minutes to apply and lasts for twenty-four hours.

VISUAL DISPLACEMENT DEVICE

Level: 1d6

Effect: Projects holographic images of the user to confuse attackers.
The images appear around the user, giving them an asset to Speed defense
actions for ten minutes per cypher level.

VOCAL TRANSLATOR

Level: 1d6

Effect: For twenty-four hours per cypher level, translates everything
said by the user into a language that anyone can understand.

WARMTH

Level: 1d6

Effect: Keeps the user warm and comfortable, even in the harshest cold
temperatures, for twenty-four hours. During this time, the user has
Armor equal to the cypher’s level that protects against cold damage.

WATER ADAPTER

Level: 1d6

Effect: The user can breathe underwater and operate at any depth
(without facing the debilitating consequences of changing pressure) for
four hours per cypher level. This cypher can also be used in the regular
atmosphere, allowing the user to ignore ill effects from very low or
very high atmospheric pressure. The cypher does not protect against
vacuum.

WEAPON ENHANCEMENT

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Modifies a weapon’s attack in a particular fashion for ten
minutes per cypher level. Roll a d100 for the modification.

WINGS

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: User can fly at their normal running speed for ten minutes per
cypher level.

X-RAY VIEWER

Level: 1d6 + 4

Effect: Allows the user to see through up to 2 feet (60 cm) of material
of a level lower than the cypher. The effect lasts for one minute per
cypher level.

ZERO POINT FIELD

Level: 1d6 + 3

Effect: Renders an inanimate object outside the effects of most energy
for one minute. This means the object cannot be harmed, moved, or
manipulated in any way. It remains in place (even in midair).

POWER BOOST CYPHERS

These cyphers increase, modify, or improve a character’s existing
powers. A burst boost cypher, for example, allows someone with the Bears
a Halo of Fire focus to create a blast of fire in all directions, one
time. Imagine this as being a fire-using superhero’s ability to “go
nova.”

Power boost cyphers affect one use of a character’s abilities but do not
require an action. Their use is part of the action that they affect.

Power boost cyphers are a special type of cypher. In some Cypher System
games, they may be inappropriate, and in others, they may be the main
(or only) type of cypher available, as determined by the GM. They can be
either subtle or manifest.

AREA BOOST

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: This cypher boosts an ability that affects a single target. The
ability expands the effect so it includes the immediate area around that
target. If the ability normally affects an immediate area, the area
becomes short. Short areas are increased to long. Long areas are
increased to very long. Abilities with very long areas become 1,000-foot
(300 m) areas. All other areas double in radius.

BURST BOOST

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: This cypher boosts an ability that affects a single target at
short range or farther. The range decreases to immediate, but the
ability affects all targets within immediate range.

DAMAGE BOOST

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: This cypher boosts an ability that inflicts points of damage.
The ability inflicts additional damage equal to this cypher’s level.

EFFICACY BOOST (MAJOR)

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: This cypher boosts an ability that requires a skill roll. The
use of the ability is eased by two steps. This kind of cypher might be
appropriate only in superhero campaigns, at least with any regularity.)

EFFICACY BOOST (MINOR)

Level: 1d6

Effect: This cypher boosts an ability that requires a skill roll. The
use of the ability is eased.

ENERGY BOOST

Level: 1d6

Effect: This cypher boosts an ability that has a stat Pool cost. The
cost is reduced to 0.

RANGE BOOST

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: This cypher boosts the range of an ability. Something that
affects only you can now affect someone you touch. Any other ability
increases its range by one category (touch to immediate, immediate to
short, short to long, long to very long, very long to 1,000 feet \[300
m\], or double for any range longer than very long).

TARGET BOOST

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: This cypher boosts an ability that affects a target at a range
greater than touch. It can affect a second target within range (if the
ability is an attack, make a separate attack roll for the second
creature).

Running the Cypher System

Setting Difficulty Ratings

The GM’s most important overall tasks are setting the stage and guiding
the story created by the group (not the one created by the GM ahead of
time). But setting difficulty is the most important mechanical task the
GM has in the game. Although there are suggestions throughout this
chapter for various difficulty ratings for certain actions, there is no
master list of the difficulty for every action a PC can take. Instead,
the Cypher System is designed with the “teach a person to fish” style of
good game mastering in mind. (If you don’t know what that means, it
comes from the old adage “Give a person a fish and they’ll eat for a
day. Teach a person to fish and they’ll eat for a lifetime.” The idea is
not to give GMs a ton of rules to memorize or reference, but to teach
them how to make their own logical judgment calls.) Of course, most of
the time, it’s not a matter of exact precision. If you say the
difficulty is 3 and it “should” have been 4, the world’s not over.

For the most part, it really is as simple as rating something on a scale
of 1 to 10, 1 being incredibly easy and 10 being basically impossible.
The guidelines in the Task Difficulty table should help put you in the
right frame of mind for assigning difficulty to a task.

For example, we make the distinction between something that most people
can do and something that trained people can do. In this case, “normal”
means someone with absolutely no training, talent, or experience—imagine
your ne’er-do-well, slightly overweight uncle trying a task he’s never
tried before. “Trained” means the person has some level of instruction
or experience but is not necessarily a professional.

With that in mind, think about the act of balance. With enough focus,
most people can walk across a narrow bridge (like a fallen tree trunk).
That suggests it is difficulty 2. However, walking across a narrow plank
that’s only 3 inches (8 cm) wide? That’s probably more like difficulty
3. Now consider walking across a tightrope. That’s probably difficulty
5—a normal person can manage that only with a great deal of luck.
Someone with some training can give it a go, but it’s still hard. Of
course, a professional acrobat can do it easily. Consider, however, that
the professional acrobat is specialized in the task, making it
difficulty 3 for them. They probably are using Effort as well during
their performance.

Let’s try another task. This time, consider how hard it might be to
remember the name of the previous leader of the village where the
character lives. The difficulty might be 0 or 1, depending on how long
ago they were the leader and how well known they were. Let’s say it was
thirty years ago and they were only mildly memorable, so it’s
difficulty 1. Most people remember them, and with a little bit of
effort, anyone can come up with their name. Now let’s consider the name
of the leader’s daughter. That’s much harder. Assuming the daughter
wasn’t famous in her own right, it’s probably difficulty 4. Even people
who know a little about local history (that is to say, people who are
trained in the subject) might not be able to remember it. But what about
the name of the pet dog owned by the daughter’s spouse? That’s probably
impossible. Who’s going to remember the name of an obscure person’s pet
from thirty years ago? Basically no one. However, it’s not forbidden
knowledge or a well-guarded secret, so it sounds like difficulty 7.
Difficulty 7 is the rating that means “No one can do this, yet some
people still do.” It’s not the stuff of legend, but it’s something you
would assume people can’t do. When you think there’s no way you can get
tickets for a sold-out concert, but somehow your friend manages to score
a couple anyway, that’s difficulty 7. (See the next section for more on
difficulties 7, 8, 9, and 10.)

If you’re talking about a task, ideally the difficulty shouldn’t be
based on the character performing the task. Things don’t get inherently
easier or harder depending on who is doing them. However, the truth is,
the character does play into it as a judgment call. If the task is
breaking down a wooden door, an 8-foot-tall (2 m) automaton made of
metal with nuclear-driven motors should be better at breaking it down
than an average human would be, but the task rating should be the same
for both. Let’s say that the automaton’s nature effectively gives it two
levels of training in such tasks. Thus, if the door has a difficulty
rating of 4, but the automaton is specialized and reduces the difficulty
to 2, it has a target number of 6. The human has no such specialization,
so the difficulty remains 4, and the person has a target number of 12.
However, when you set the difficulty of breaking down the door, don’t
try to take all those differences into account. The GM should consider
only the human because the Task Difficulty table is based on the ideal
of a “normal” person, a “trained” person, and so on. It’s humanocentric.

Most characters probably are willing to use one or two levels of Effort
on a task, and they might have an appropriate skill or asset to decrease
the difficulty by a step. That means that a difficulty 4 task will often
be treated as difficulty 2 or even 1, and those are easy rolls to make.
Don’t hesitate, then, to pull out higher-level difficulties. The PCs can
rise to the challenge, especially if they are experienced.

The Impossible Difficulties

Difficulties 7, 8, 9, and 10 are all technically impossible. Their
target numbers are 21, 24, 27, and 30, and you can’t roll those numbers
on a d20 no matter how many times you try. Consider, however, all the
ways that a character can reduce difficulty. If someone spends a little
Effort or has some skill or help, it brings difficulty 7 (target number
21) into the range of possibility—difficulty 6 (target number 18). Now
consider that they have specialization, use a lot of Effort, and have
help. That might bring the difficulty down to 1 or even 0 (reducing it
by two steps from training and specialization, three or four steps from
Effort, and one step from the asset of assistance). That practically
impossible task just became routine. A fourth-tier character can and
will do this—not every time, due to the cost, but perhaps once per game
session. You have to be ready for that. A well-prepared, motivated  
sixth-tier character can do that even with a difficulty 10 task. Again,
they won’t do it often (they’d have to apply six levels of Effort, and
even with an Edge of 6 that would cost 7 points from their Pool, and
that’s assuming they’re specialized and have two levels of assets), but
it can happen if they’re really prepared for the task (being specialized
and maxed out in asset opportunities reduces the difficulty by four more
steps). That’s why sixth-tier characters are at the top of their field,
so to speak.

False Precision

One way to look at difficulty is that each step of difficulty is worth 3
on the die. That is to say, hinder the task by one step, and the target
number rises by 3. Ease the task by one step, and the target number is
lowered by 3. Those kinds of changes are big, meaty chunks. Difficulty,
as a game mechanic, is not terribly precise. It’s measured in large
portions. You never have a target number of 13 or 14, for example—it’s
always 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and so on. (Technically, this is not true. If a
character adds 1 to a d20 roll for some reason, it changes a target
number of 15 to 14. But this is not worth much discussion.)

Imprecision is good in this case. It would be false precision to say
that one lock has a target number of 14 and another has a target number
of 15. What false precision means in this context is that it would be a
delusion to think we can be that exact. Can you really say that one lock
is 5% easier to pick than another? And more important, even if you
could, is the difference worth noting? It’s better to interact with the
world in larger, more meaningful chunks than to try to parse things so
carefully. If we tried to rate everything on a scale of 1 to 30 (using
target numbers and not difficulty), we’d start to get lost in the
proverbial weeds coming up with a meaningful distinction between
something rated as an 8 and something rated as a 9 on that scale.

Routine Actions

Don’t hesitate to make actions routine. Don’t call for die rolls when
they’re not really needed. Sometimes GMs fall into the trap illustrated
by this dialogue:

**GM:** What do you do?

Player: I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

**GM:** Okay, give me a roll.

That’s not a good instinct—at least, not for the Cypher System. Players
should roll when it’s interesting or exciting. Otherwise, they should
just do what they do. If the PCs tie a rope around something and use it
to climb down into a pit, you could ask for tying rolls, climbing rolls,
and so on, but why? Just to see if they roll terribly? So the rope can
come undone at the wrong time, or a character’s hand can slip? Most of
the time, that makes players feel inadequate and isn’t a lot of fun. A
rope coming undone in the middle of an exciting chase scene or a battle
can be a great complication (and that’s what GM intrusions are for). A
rope coming undone in the middle of a simple “getting from point A to
point B” scene only slows down gameplay. The real fun—the real story—is
down in the pit. So get the PCs down there.

There are a million exceptions to this guideline, of course. If
creatures are throwing poisoned darts at the PCs while they climb, that
might make things more interesting and require a roll. If the pit is
filled with acid and the PCs must climb halfway down, pull a lever, and
come back up, that’s a situation where you should set difficulty and
perhaps have a roll. If a PC is near death, carrying a fragile item of
great importance, or something similar, climbing down the rope is tense,
and a roll might add to the excitement. The important difference is that
these kinds of complications have real consequences.

On the flip side, don’t be afraid to use GM intrusion on routine actions
if it makes things more interesting. Walking up to the king in his
audience chamber in the middle of a ceremony only to trip on a rug? That
could have huge ramifications for the character and the story.

Other Ways to Judge Difficulty

Rating things on a scale of 1 to 10 is something that most people are
very familiar with. You can also look at it as rating an object or
creature on a similar scale, if that’s easier. In other words, if you
don’t know how hard it would be to climb a particular cliff face, think
of it as a creature the PCs have to fight. What level would the creature
be? You could look in the Creatures chapter and say “I think this wall
should be about as difficult to deal with as a demon. A demon is level
5, so the task of climbing the wall will be difficulty 5.” That’s a
weird way to do it, perhaps, but it’s fairly straightforward. And if
you’re the kind of GM who thinks in terms of “How tough will this fight
be?” then maybe rating tasks as creatures or NPCs to fight isn’t so
strange after all. It’s just another way to relate to them. The
important thing is that they’re on the same scale. Similarly, if the PCs
have to tackle a knowledge task—say, trying to determine if they know
where a caravan is headed based on its tracks—you could rate the task in
terms of an object. If you’re used to rating doors or other objects that
the PCs have broken through recently, the knowledge task is just a
different kind of barrier to bust through.

Everything in the Cypher System—characters, creatures, objects, tasks,
and so on—has a level. It might be called a tier or a difficulty instead
of a level, but ultimately it’s a numerical rating system used to
compare things. Although you have to be careful about drawing too many
correlations—a first-tier character isn’t easily compared to a
difficulty 1 wall or a level 1 animal—the principle is the same.
Everything can be rated and roughly compared to everything else in the
world. (It works best to take PCs out of this equation. For example, you
shouldn’t try to compare a PC’s tier to a wall’s level. Character tiers
are mentioned here only for completeness.)

Last, if your mind leans toward statistics, you can look at difficulty
as a percentage chance. Every number on the d20 is a 5% increment. For
example, you have a 5% chance of rolling a 1. You have a 10% chance of
rolling a 1 or a 2. Thus, if you need to roll a 12 or higher, you have a
45% chance of success. (A d20 has nine numbers that are 12 or higher:
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. And 9 <span dir="rtl">×</span> 5
equals 45.)

For some people, it’s easier to think in terms of a percentage chance. A
GM might think “She has about a 30% chance to know that fact about
geography.” Each number on a d20 is a 5% increment, and it takes six
increments to equal 30%, so there are six numbers that mean the PC
succeeds: 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Thus, since the player has to roll
15 or higher, that means the target number is 15. (And that means the
task is level 5, but if you’ve already determined the target number, you
likely don’t care about the level.)

ADVANTAGES TO THIS SYSTEM

1\. The GM makes measured adjustments in large, uniform steps. That
makes things faster than if players had to do arithmetic using a range
of all numbers from 1 to 20.

2\. You calculate a target number only once no matter how many times the
PCs attempt the action. If you establish that the target number is 12,
it’s 12 every time a PC tries that action. (On the other hand, if you
had to add numbers to your die roll, you’d have to do it for every
attempt.) Consider this fact in light of combat. Once a player knows
that they need to roll a 12 or higher to hit a foe, combat moves very
quickly.

3\. If a PC can reduce the difficulty of an action to 0, no roll is
needed. This means that an Olympic gymnast doesn’t roll a die to walk
across a balance beam, but the average person does. The task is
initially rated the same for both, but the difficulty is reduced for the
gymnast. There’s no chance of failure.

4\. This is how everything in the game works, whether it’s climbing a
wall,  
sweet-talking a guard, or fighting a bioengineered horror.

5\. Perhaps most important, the system gives GMs the freedom to focus
entirely on the flow of the game. The GM doesn’t use dice to determine
what happens (unless you want to)—the players do. There aren’t a lot of
different rules for different actions, so there is little to remember
and very little to reference. The difficulty can be used as a narrative
tool, with the challenges always meeting the expected logic of the game.
All the GM’s mental space can be devoted to guiding the story.

GM Intrusion

GM intrusion is the main mechanic that the GM uses to inject drama and
additional excitement into the game. It’s also a handy tool for
resolving issues that affect the PCs but do not involve them. GM
intrusion is a way to facilitate what goes on in the world outside the
characters. Can the minotaur track the PCs’ movements through the maze?
Will the fraying rope hold?

Since the players roll all the dice, GM intrusion is used to determine
if and when something happens. For example, if the PCs are fighting a
noble’s guards, and you (the GM) know that there are more guards nearby,
you don’t need to roll dice to determine if the other guards hear the
scuffle and intervene (unless you want to). You just decide when it
would be best for the story—which is probably when it would be worst for
the characters. In a way, GM intrusion replaces the GM’s die rolling.

The mechanic is also one of the main ways that GMs award experience
points to the PCs. This means that you use experience points as a
narrative tool. Whenever it seems appropriate, you can introduce
complications into the game that affect a specific player, but when you
do so, you give that player 1 XP. The player can refuse the intrusion,
but doing so costs them 1 XP. So by refusing an intrusion, the player
does not get the experience point that the GM is offering, and they lose
one that they already have. (This kind of refusal is likely to happen
very rarely in your game, if ever. And, obviously, a player can’t refuse
an intrusion if they have no XP to spend.)

Here’s how a GM intrusion might work in play. Say the PCs find a hidden
console with some buttons. They learn the right order in which to press
the buttons, and a section of the floor disappears. As the GM, you don’t
ask the players specifically where their characters are standing.
Instead, you give a player 1 XP and say “Unfortunately, you’re standing
directly over this new hole in the floor.” If the player wanted, they
could refuse the XP, spend one of their own, and say “I leap aside to
safety.” Most likely, though, they’ll make the defense roll that you
call for and let it play out.

There are two ways for the GM to handle this kind of intrusion. You
could say “You’re standing in the wrong place, so make a roll.” (It’s a
Speed defense roll, of course.) Alternatively, you could say “You’re
standing in the wrong place. The floor opens under your feet, and you
fall down into the darkness.” In the first example, the PC has a chance
to save themselves. In the second example, they don’t. Both are viable
options. The distinction is based on any number of factors, including
the situation, the characters involved, and the needs of the story. This
might seem arbitrary or even capricious, but you’re the master of what
the intrusion can and can’t do. RPG mechanics need consistency so
players can make intelligent decisions based on how they understand the
world to work. But they’ll never base their decisions on GM intrusions.
They don’t know when intrusions will happen or what form they will take.
GM intrusions are the unpredictable and strange twists of fate that
affect a person’s life every day.

When player modifications (such as skill, Effort, and so on) determine
that success is automatic, the GM can use GM intrusion to negate the
automatic success. The player must roll for the action at its original
difficulty level or target number 20, whichever is lower.

(Remember, any time you give a player 1 XP for a GM intrusion, you’re
actually giving them 2— one to keep and one to give to another player.)

Using GM Intrusion as a Narrative Tool

A GM can use this narrative tool to steer things. That doesn’t mean
railroad the players or direct the action of the game with a heavy hand.
GM intrusion doesn’t enable you to say “You’re all captured, so here’s
your 1 XP.” Instead, the GM can direct things more subtly—gently, almost
imperceptibly influencing events rather than forcing them. GM intrusion
represents things going wrong. The bad guys planning well. Fortune not
favoring the characters.

Consider this scenario: the GM plants an interesting adventure seed in a
small village, but the PCs don’t stay there long enough to find it. So
just outside the village, the PCs run afoul of a vicious viper that
bites one of them. The GM uses intrusion to say that the poison from the
snake will make the character debilitated unless they get a large dose
of a specific antitoxin, which the group doesn’t have. Of course, they
aren’t required to go back to the village where the GM’s interesting
adventure can start, but it’s likely that they will, looking for the
antitoxin.

Some players might find intrusion heavy-handed, but the XP softens the
blow. And remember, they can refuse these narrative nudges. Intrusion is
not meant to be a railroading tool—just a bit of a rudder. Not an
inescapable track, but a nudge here and there.

What’s more, the GM doesn’t need to have a deliberate goal in mind. The
complication you introduce could simply make things more interesting.
You might not know where it will take the story, just that it will make
the story better.

This is wonderfully empowering to the GM—not in a “Ha ha, now I’ll
trounce the PCs” way, but in an “I can control the narrative a little
bit, steering it more toward the story I want to create rather than
relying on the dice” sort of way. Consider that old classic plot
development in which the PCs get captured and must escape from the bad
guys. In heroic fiction, this is such a staple that it would almost seem
strange if it didn’t happen. But in many roleplaying games, it’s a
nearly impossible turn of events—the PCs usually have too many ways to
get out of the bad guy’s clutches before they’re captured. The dice have
to be wildly against them. It virtually never happens. With GM
intrusion, it could happen (again, in the context of the larger
encounter, not as a single intrusion that results in the entire group of
PCs being captured with little explanation or chance to react).

For example, let’s say the PCs are surrounded by orcs. One character is
badly injured—debilitated—and the rest are hurt. Some of the orcs
produce a large weighted net. Rather than asking for a lot of rolls and
figuring the mechanics for escape, you use intrusion and say that the
net goes over the PCs who are still on their feet. The rest of the orcs
point spears menacingly. This is a pretty strong cue to the players that
surrender is a good (and possibly the only) option. Some players won’t
take the hint, however, so another use of intrusion might allow the orcs
to hit one of the trapped PCs on the head and render them unconscious
while their friends struggle in the net. If the players still don’t
surrender, it’s probably best to play out the rest of the encounter
without more GM intrusions—using more would be heavy-handed by anyone’s
measure—although it’s perfectly reasonable to rule that a character
rendered debilitated is knocked unconscious, since the orcs are trying
to take the PCs alive.

(Remember that GM intrusions can occur at any time, not just during
combat. Disrupting or changing a tense interaction with NPCs can have
big repercussions.)

Using GM Intrusion as a Resolution Mechanic

This mechanic offers a way for the GM to determine how things happen in
the game without leaving it all to random chance. Bad guys trying to
smash down the door to the room where the PCs are holed up? You could
roll a bunch of dice, compare the NPCs’ stats to the door’s stats, and
so on, or you could wait until the most interesting time, have the bad
guys break in, and award an experience point to the PC who tried their
best to bar the door. The latter way is the Cypher System way. Intrusion
is a task resolution tool for the GM. In other words, you don’t base
things on stats but on narrative choice. (Frankly, a lot of great GMs
over the years—even in the very early days of the hobby—have run their
games this way. Sometimes they rolled dice or pretended to roll dice,
but they were really manipulating things.) This method frees the GM from
worrying about mechanics and looking up stats and allows them to focus
on the story.

This isn’t cheating—it’s the rules of the game. This rule simply
replaces traditional dice rolling with good game mastering, logic, and
intelligent storytelling. When a PC is climbing a burning rope, and
everyone knows that it will break at some point, the game has a
mechanism to ensure that it breaks at just the right time.

Variant: If you want more randomness in your game, or if you want your
game to seem like more of a simulation, assign a flat percentage chance
for whatever you’re trying to resolve. For example, each round, the star
troopers have a 20% chance to blast through the door—or, if you want the
risk to escalate, a cumulative 20% chance to blast through the door. By
not using GM intrusion, this method robs the PCs of a few XP, but when
they see you rolling dice, it might help with their immersion.
Alternatively, you can pretend to roll dice but really use GM intrusion,
though this method seriously robs the characters of XP.

There’s a better way. Announce your intrusion, but say that there’s only
a chance it will happen (state the percentage chance), and then roll the
dice in plain view of everyone. If the intrusion occurs, award the XP as
normal. This is likely the best of both worlds. However, it takes the
narrative power out of your hands and gives it to the dice. Perhaps this
method is best used only occasionally. If nothing else, it injects some
variety and certainly some drama.

Using (and Not Abusing) GM Intrusion

Too much of a good thing will make the game seem utterly
unpredictable—even capricious. The ideal is to use about four GM
intrusions per game session, depending on the length of the session, or
about one intrusion per hour of game play. This is in addition to any
intrusions that are triggered by players rolling a 1.

Intrusion Through Player Rolls

When a PC rolls a 1, handle the GM intrusion the same way that you’d
handle an intrusion you initiated. The intrusion could mean the PC
fumbles or botches whatever they were trying to do, but it could mean
something else. Consider these alternatives:

\* In combat, the PC’s foe is not as hurt as they thought. Give the foe
5 extra points of health.

\* In combat, the PC drops their guard, and the foe gets a free attack.

\* In combat, reinforcements for the PC’s foes show up.

\* In combat (or any stressful situation), an ally decides to flee.

\* In combat (or any stressful situation), an ally doesn’t like the PCs
as much as they thought. The ally steals from them or betrays them.

\* Out of combat, the PC’s pack falls open, or the sole of their shoe
tears open.

\* Out of combat, it begins to rain heavily.

\* Out of combat, a surprise foe appears, and the scene turns into a
combat.

\* In an interaction, the GM introduces a surprising motive for the NPC.
For example, the PCs are trying to bribe an official for information,
and the official reveals that what they really want isn’t money but for
someone to rescue their kidnapped son.

(This might not be true of your players, but many players rarely, if
ever, spend XP to refuse an intrusion from the GM, though they regularly
use XP to avoid an intrusion that comes from a bad roll. And there’s
nothing wrong with that. Some GMs might want to forbid using an XP to
reroll a 1, but there’s really no point—if you’ve got an idea for a good
intrusion, you don’t need to wait until a player rolls a 1 to use it.)

GM Intrusion That Affects the Group

The core of the idea behind GM intrusion is that the player being
adversely affected gains an experience point. But what if the intrusion
affects the whole group equally? What if the GM uses it to have an
unstable device overload and explode, harming all the characters? In
this case, if no PC is involved more than the others (for example, no
single PC was frantically attempting to repair the device), you should
give 1 XP to each character but not give any of them an extra XP to hand
out to someone else.

However, this kind of group intrusion should be an exception, not the
rule. GM intrusions are much more effective if they are more personal.

Example GM Intrusions

It’s not a good idea to use the same events as GM intrusions over and
over (“Dolmar dropped his sword *again*?”). Below are a number of
different intrusions you can use.

Bad Luck

Through no fault of the characters, something happens that is bad or at
least complicating. For example:

\* The floorboard beneath the PC gives way.

\* The boat lists to starboard at just the wrong moment.

\* A gust of wind blows the papers out of the character’s hand.

\* The buckle of the PC’s pack snaps at an inopportune time.

\* The NPC that the characters need to speak with is home sick today.

\* A device (cypher or artifact) malfunctions or gives the user a jolt.

An Unknown Complication Emerges

The situation was more complex (and therefore more interesting) than the
PCs knew—perhaps even more than the GM knew, at least at the start. For
example:

\* A poisonous snake darts out from the tall grass and attacks.

\* The box that holds the plans is trapped with a poison needle.

\* The NPC that the PCs need to befriend doesn’t speak their language.

\* The NPC that the PCs try to bribe is allergic to the bottle of
alcohol they offer.

\* The PCs find the book they need, but the pages are so brittle that if
they open it, it might crumble.

An Impending Complication Emerges

GMs can use this type of intrusion as a resolution mechanic to determine
NPC success or failure. Rather than rolling dice to see how long it
takes an NPC to rewire a damaged force field generator, it happens at a
time of the GM’s choosing—ideally when it would be most interesting. For
example:

\* The goblin reinforcements finally get through the locked door.

\* The ropes of the old rope bridge finally snap.

\* The city guards show up.

vThe unstable ceiling collapses.

\* The NPC who holds a dagger to a character’s throat and says “Don’t
move” cuts the PC when they do, in fact, move, putting them immediately
at debilitated on the damage track.

Opponent Luck or Skill

The PCs aren’t the only ones with surprising tricks up their sleeves.
For example:

\* The PC’s opponent uses a lightning-fast maneuver to dodge all
attacks.

\* The PC’s opponent sees an opening and makes an additional, immediate
attack.

\* The NPC commander rallies their troops, who all deal 2 additional
points of damage for one round.

\* The PC’s opponent uses a cypher or similar device that produces just
the right effect for the situation.

\* A bit of the wall collapses in the middle of the fight, preventing
the characters from chasing the fleeing NPC.

Fumbles

Although you might not want every player roll of 1 to be a fumble,
sometimes it could be just that. Alternatively, the GM could simply
declare that a fumble has occurred. In either case, consider the
following examples:

\* In combat, the PC drops their weapon.

\* In combat, the PC misses and strikes the wall, breaking or damaging
their weapon.

\* In combat, the NPC hits the PC harder than usual, inflicting 2
additional points of damage.

\* In combat, the PC hits an ally by accident and inflicts regular
damage.

\* Out of combat, the PC drops or mishandles an important object or
piece of equipment.

\* In an interaction, the PC inadvertently or unknowingly says something
offensive.

Partial Success

GM intrusion doesn’t have to mean that a PC has failed. For example:

\* The PC disables the explosive device before it goes off, but if
someone doesn’t remain and hold the detonator, it will still explode.

\* The PC creates the antidote, but it will turn the imbiber’s flesh
blue for the next few weeks.

\* The PC jumps across the pit but accidentally knocks loose some stones
from the edge, making the jump harder for their friend right behind
them.

PLAYER INTRUSIONS

Player intrusions give the players a small bit of narrative control over
the world. However, the world still remains in the GM’s purview. You can
always overrule a player intrusion, or suggest a way to massage it so
that it fits better into the setting. Still, because it is indeed
narrative control, a player intrusion should always involve a small
aspect of the world beyond the character. “I punch my foe really hard”
is an expression of Effort or perhaps character ability. “My foe slips
and falls backward off the ledge” is a player intrusion.

Player intrusions should never be as big as GM intrusions. They should
not end an encounter, only (perhaps) provide the PC with the means to
more easily end an encounter. They should not have a wide-reaching or
even necessarily a long-term effect on the setting. A way to consider
this might be that player intrusions can affect a single object (a
floorboard snaps), feature (there’s a hidden shallow spot in the stream
to ford), or NPC (the vendor is an old friend). But not more than that.
A player intrusion can’t affect a whole village or even a whole tavern
in that village. A rock can come loose, but a player intrusion can’t
create a landslide.

Tying Actions to Stats

Although the decision is open to your discretion, when a PC takes an
action, it should be fairly obvious which stat is tied to that action.
Physical actions that involve brute force or endurance use Might.
Physical actions that involve quickness, coordination, or agility use
Speed. Actions that involve intelligence, education, insight, willpower,
or charm use Intellect.

In rare instances, you could allow a PC to use a different stat for a
task. For example, a character might try to break down a door by
examining it closely for flaws and thus use Intellect rather than Might.
This kind of change is a good thing because it encourages player
creativity. Just don’t let it be abused by an exuberant or too-clever
player. It’s well within your purview to decide that the door has no
flaws, or to rule that the character’s attempt will take half an hour
rather than one round. In other words, using a stat that is not the
obvious choice should be the exception, not the rule.

Cyphers

You should think of cyphers as character abilities, whether they’re
subtle cyphers or manifest cyphers. This means that it is incumbent upon
you to make sure that players always have plenty of cyphers to use. In
the course of their travels, the PCs should find that cyphers are
extremely common. And since the PCs are limited in the number of cyphers
they can carry, they will use them liberally.

Manifest cyphers can be found by scavenging through old ruins. They can
be found in the corpses of magical or technological foes. They can be
found among the possessions of intelligent fallen opponents or the lairs
of unintelligent creatures, either amid the bones of former meals or as
shiny decorations in a nest. They can be found in villages, in the back
of a merchant’s cart that sells junk and scavenged parts. They are
offered as rewards by people who are grateful for the PCs’ help.

Some adventures will offer more cyphers than others. Still, as a rule of
thumb, in any given adventure, a character should use at least as many
cyphers as they can carry. This means they should find that number of
cyphers in that same amount of time (give or take). Thus, you can simply
add up the number of cyphers the PCs can carry, and on average, they
should find at least that many cyphers in a given adventure.

If your players are typical, they will use combat-related cyphers
liberally but hold onto their utility cyphers. A ray emitter or
defensive shield will be used, but a suspensor belt or phasing module
will linger longer on their character sheets.

As with everything else in the game, it’s intentionally very easy for
the GM to create new cyphers. Just think of the effect and how to
express it as a game advantage. Two kinds of cyphers exist when it comes
to effect: those that allow the user to do something better, and those
that allow the user to do something they couldn’t do otherwise.

The first group includes everything that reduces the difficulty of a
task (including defense tasks). The second group includes things that
grant new abilities, such as flight, a new means of attack, the ability
to see into the past, or any number of other powers.

A few more important notes about devising new cyphers:

\* Cyphers should be single-use items. The PCs use them up and find new
ones.

\* Cyphers should be potent. A minor ability isn’t worth the trouble. If
an attack cypher isn’t as good as a regular weapon, why bother with it?

\* Cyphers shouldn’t have drawbacks.

\* Cyphers should be temporary. Typically, a power is used once.
Abilities or advantages that have a duration last from ten minutes to
twenty-four hours (at most).

\* Manifest cyphers can take any form. Just make them appropriate to the
genre.

(Cyphers teach GMs to design different kinds of scenarios—ones in which
the whole adventure isn’t wrecked if a player has something that can
solve a single problem (defeat a foe, read a mind, bypass a barrier, or
whatever). There should always be more to the adventure than one
linchpin encounter, obstacle, foe, or secret.)

(It’s all right if players think of cyphers (especially manifest
cyphers) as equipment or treasure. You should choose points in the
course of the story that are appropriate for awarding subtle cyphers,
especially if the PCs aren’t at their full capacity.)

Artifacts

In terms of the narrative, artifacts are a lot like cyphers, except that
most are not one-use items. Mechanically, they serve a very different
purpose. It’s assumed that characters are exploring with some cyphers at
their disposal. Artifacts, however, are added abilities that make
characters broader, deeper, and often more powerful. They aren’t
assumed—they’re extra.

The powers granted by artifacts are more like the abilities gained from
a character’s type or focus in that they change the way the PC is played
overall. The difference between an artifact and a type or focus ability
is that almost all artifacts are temporary. They last longer than
cyphers do, but because they have a depletion roll, any use could be
their last.

Like cyphers, then, artifacts are a way for the GM to play a role in the
development of the characters. Although armor, weapons, and the like are
fine, special capabilities—such as long-range communication or
travel—can really change the way the PCs interact with the world and how
they deal with challenges. Some of these abilities enable the actions
you want the PCs to take. For example, if you want them to have an
underwater adventure, provide them with artifacts (or cyphers) that
allow them to breathe underwater.

Also like cyphers, artifacts are simple for the GM to create. The only
difference with artifacts is that you give them a depletion roll, using
any numbers on 1d6, 1d10, 1d20, or 1d100. If you want the artifact to be
used only a few times, give it a depletion roll of 1 in 1d6, 1 or 2 in
1d10, or even 1 or 2 in 1d6. If you want the PCs to use it over and
over, a depletion roll of 1 in 1d100 more or less means that they can
use it freely without worrying too much.

For examples of artifacts, see the Genres chapter.

(You may wish to forbid the use of XP to reroll artifact depletion
rolls. That’s pretty reasonable.)

FANTASY ARTIFACTS

If cyphers are the expendable magic that is ever-present in fantasy,
artifacts are the more durable magic items that can be used over and
over again—swords, armor, tomes of weird magic, cloaks of invisibility,
and so on. Unlike cyphers, there is no limit to how many artifacts a
character can bear; an entire campaign might stem from an ongoing quest
to collect all of the legendary items carried by a famous hero.

EXAMPLE FANTASY ARTIFACTS

The rest of this chapter is examples of artifacts suitable for a fantasy
game. The artifacts are divided into two tables—one for minor items
(artifacts that don’t have particularly flashy or world-affecting
abilities) and one for major items (artifacts that do). A GM running a
campaign where magic is subtle, weak, or otherwise limited can use the
minor items table, and a GM of a campaign where some magic can do
powerful or even impossible things can roll on either table.

\* Artifact found in the Fantasy Artifacts section of the Cypher System

ADAMANTINE ROPE

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: A 50-foot (15 m) length of black rope

Effect: This length of rope has the flexibility of ordinary rope but a
hardness greater than steel. It is impervious to damage (including
attempts to cut it) from anything less than the artifact’s level.

Depletion: —

ALCHEMIST BAG

Level: 1d6

Form: Embroidered velvet bag

Effect: This bag can contain up to one cypher per artifact level, as
long as each is no larger than a typical potion bottle or scroll case.
These cyphers do not count against a character’s cypher limit.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each time a cypher is added to the bag)

ARMORED CLOTH

Level: 1d6

Form: Suit of typical clothing (robe, dress, jerkin and breeches, and so
on)

Effect: This clothing is soft and flexible, as expected, except when it
is struck or crushed with force, at which point it hardens, providing +1
to Armor. It then immediately returns to its normal state (which is in
no way encumbering). This clothing cannot be worn with armor of any
kind.

Depletion: —

BELT OF STRENGTH

Level: 1d6

Form: Thick leather belt with a metal buckle and rivets

Effect: The belt enhances the strength and endurance of the wearer. This
increases the wearer’s maximum Might Pool by 5 (or by 7 if the artifact
is level 6 or higher). If the wearer removes the belt, any excess Might
points above their normal maximum Might Pool are lost; if they wear the
belt again, the points do not automatically return (they must be
restored with recovery rolls, healing magic, or similar effects).

Depletion: —

BOOK OF ALL SPELLS 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: Weighty tome filled with pages of spell runes 

Effect: This mysterious spellbook is said to contain knowledge of
hundreds of spells—perhaps even all spells. Each set of facing pages
includes the magical runes for one spell and a description of the spell
and how to use it. 

When a character first opens the book, the GM randomly determines what
type of spell is shown by rolling on the following table, then rolling
on the indicated table in the Cypher System Reference Document: 

| d6  | Cypher Type                        |
|-----|------------------------------------|
| 1–2 | Roll on the Manifest Cypher table  |
| 3-5 | Roll on the Fantastic Cypher table |
| 6   | Roll on the Subtle Cypher table    |

The bearer can cast the spell on the page as if it were a cypher with a
level equal to the book’s level. This doesn’t remove the spell from the
page (it can be cast again and again), but it does require a depletion
roll. 

As part of another action, the bearer can turn the page to find a new
spell, but only forward, never backward. It is said that turning to the
last page makes the book vanish and appear somewhere else in the world. 

The artifact always remembers the last page it was turned to. Opening
the book always presents that page. Attempting to copy, remove, or
destroy a page only makes the book turn to a later page on its own. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d100 (Check each time the book is used or the bearer
turns a page. The chance of depletion increases by 1 each time it is
used \[1 in 1d100, 2 in 1d100, 3 in 1d100, and so on\]. Instead of
depleting, the book might turn to a later page, or disappear and
reappear somewhere else in the world.)

BOUNDING BOOTS 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: Sturdy but flexible boots 

Effect: The boots assist the wearer’s every step to make jumping and
running easier. The boots are an asset for jumping and running (easing
one of these skills by two steps if the artifact is level 6 or higher). 

Depletion: — 

CAT’S EYE SPECTACLES 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Pair of dark crystalline spectacles in a dull wooden frame 

Effect: Outside, the wearer can see at night as if it were daylight.
Inside, the wearer can see in pitch darkness up to short range (or to
long range if the artifact is level 5 or higher). 

Depletion: — 

CLOAK OF BALAKAR 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Blue cloak with elaborate designs suggesting blowing wind 

Effect: The wearer can calm winds of the artifact’s level or lower in a
radius of 1 mile (1.5 km). Up to once a day, the wearer can create a
destructive windstorm up to that size, lasting one minute; this storm’s
level is equal to half the artifact’s level. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (on depletion, cloak disappears and reappears
somewhere else in the world) 

CLOAK OF ELFKIND 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: Thin greyish-green cloak with a cowl and clasp 

Effect: When activated (by drawing the hood over the wearer’s head), the
cloak takes on the colors and textures of everything around the wearer
for ten minutes (or one hour if the artifact is level 8 or higher). This
eases hiding and sneaking tasks by two steps. While the cloak is
activated, the wearer can also see in the dark. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d100

CLOAK OF FINERY 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: Multilayered cloak of glittering material 

Effect: This cloak is woven of beautiful fibers and set with dazzling
gems. It automatically fits itself to its wearer in the most flattering
way. When activated, it enhances the wearer’s appearance, voice, tone,
and even their grammar, granting an asset to all interaction tasks for
the next minute. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 

COIL OF ENDLESS ROPE 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Coil of rope 

Effect: The coil of rope can be let out at a rate of 50 feet (15 m) per
round; however, no end to the rope can be found no matter how long the
user uncoils it. The rope retains its incredible length until recoiled
or until it becomes depleted. If cut, any length beyond the coil’s
initial 50 feet crumbles into powder after a round or two. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each use that extends it beyond 50 feet) 

CROWN OF EYES 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Metallic circlet set with several crystal spheres 

Effect: It takes one round to activate the crown. When activated, the
crystal spheres separate from the crown and fly around the wearer at
immediate range for an hour. The wearer can see anything the crystal
spheres can see. This allows the wearer to peek around corners without
being exposed to danger. This gives the wearer an asset in initiative
and all perception tasks. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d100

CROWN OF THE MIND 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Crown, circlet, headband, diadem, or amulet 

Effect: The crown augments the mind and thoughts of the wearer. This
increases the wearer’s maximum Intellect Pool by 5 (or by 7 if the
artifact is level 6 or higher). If the wearer removes the crown, any
excess Intellect points above their normal maximum Intellect Pool are
lost; if they wear the crown again, the points do not automatically
return (they must be restored with recovery rolls, healing magic, or
similar effects). 

Depletion: — 

CRYSTAL BALL 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Melon-sized crystalline or glass orb, with or without a support
stand 

Effect: This allows the user to scry (view) remote locations and
creatures. The user must make a difficulty 2 Intellect task to activate
the crystal ball, then use an action trying to make it show a person or
location they know. The user must succeed at an Intellect task against
the level of the target; otherwise, the crystal shows only indistinct or
misleading images. The task roll is modified by how familiar the target
is to the user, how available they are to be viewed, and how far away
they are.

| Familiarity                      |          |
|----------------------------------|----------|
| Only have name or description    | Hindered |
| Target has been visited          | Eased    |
| Target is well known to the user | Eased    |
| Availability                     |          |
| Target is willing                | Eased    |
| Target is unwilling              | Hindered |
| Distance                         |          |
| More than 1 mile                 | Hindered |
| More than 10 miles               | Hindered |
| More than 100 miles              | Hindered |

These modifiers are cumulative, so trying to view a level 4 target who
the user knows only by name (+1 step), is unwilling (+1 step), and is 20
miles away (+2 steps) is a difficulty 8 task.

 The crystal shows the creature or area for one minute before the image
becomes muddled and the artifact must be activated again. 

In addition to the normal options for using Effort, the user can choose
to apply a level of Effort to open two-way communication with the viewed
area. All creatures in the area can sense the user’s presence and hear
their voice, and the creatures can speak to and be heard by the user. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

An unwilling creature’s defenses against magic and Intellect attacks
should hinder scrying attempts just as they would against a directly
harmful mental spell.

DEATH’S SCYTHE 

Level: 1d6 + 4 

Form: Double-handed scythe 

Effect: This scythe functions as a heavy weapon. In addition, it
instantly kills level 1 or level 2 creatures it hits. In addition to the
normal options for using Effort, the user can choose to use a level of
Effort to affect a higher-level target; each level of Effort applied
increases the level of creature that can be instantly killed by the
scythe. Thus, to instantly kill a level 5 target (three levels above the
normal limit), the wielder must apply three levels of Effort. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check per killing effect; upon depletion, a
manifestation of Death appears to reclaim its blade)

Death manifestation: level 7

DEMONFLESH 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: Ball of black leather with vein-like red streaks 

Effect: When activated, the ball liquefies and coats the body of the
user for one hour, appearing to be a form-fitting leather suit veined
with pathways of dully glowing blood. As an action, the wearer can
become invisible. While invisible, they are specialized in stealth and
Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if they do something to reveal
their presence or position—attacking, casting a spell, using an ability,
moving a large object, and so on. If this occurs, they can regain the
remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to focus on hiding
their position. The wearer can inflict 3 points of damage with a touch
by releasing a dark crackle of demonic power. This attack ignores most
Armor, but Armor made to ward against evil or demonic attacks should
work against it. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

To randomly determine what kind of dragontongue weapon is found, see
Chapter 4: Medieval Fantasy Equipment, page 34.

DEMONIC RUNE BLADE 

Level: 1d6 + 4 

Form: Sword inscribed with demonic runes 

Effect: This longsword functions as a medium weapon, but it is actually
a powerful demon transformed into the shape of a sword. The demon cannot
speak directly to the wielder, but it can make its desires known by
emitting bass rumbles and dirgelike melodies, and by pulling in the
direction of its desire. The sword eases all attacks made with it by one
step, and it inflicts 4 additional points of damage (for a total of 8
points). 

If the wielder kills a creature with the sword, the sword eats the
creature’s spirit and transfers some of its energy to the wielder,
adding 5 points to their Might Pool and increasing their Might Edge
by 1. This lasts for an hour and allows the wielder to exceed their
normal Might Pool and Might Edge stats.

If the wielder misses with an attack, the blade sometimes hits an ally
of the wielder instead (this always happens on an attack roll of 1). 

Depletion: 1 in 1d10 (check each time a killed creature’s life force is
absorbed; if depleted, the sword’s magical abilities can be recharged if
it kills an “innocent” creature) 

DRAGONTONGUE WEAPON 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: Weapon that roars with red flame when activated, trailing a stream
of black smoke

Effect: This weapon functions as a normal weapon of its type. If the
wielder uses it to attack a foe, upon a successful hit, the wielder
decides whether to activate the flame. Upon activation, the weapon
lashes the target with fire, inflicting additional points of damage
equal to the artifact level. The effect lasts for one minute after each
activation. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d100

DRAGONTOOTH SOLDIERS 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: Burlap bag containing a handful of large reptilian teeth

 Effect: If a tooth is drawn from the bag and cast upon the earth, a
dragontooth warrior appears, ready to fight for the user for up to ten
minutes before going their own way. The user can draw several teeth at
once from the bag, but each tooth drawn requires a separate depletion
roll. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d10 

Dragontooth warrior: level equal to the artifact level, Speed defense as
artifact level + 1 due to shield; Armor 1; spear attack (melee or short
range) inflicts damage and impedes movement of victim to immediate range
for one round

ELFBLADE 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Medium sword

Effect: This sword can be used as a normal medium sword that deals 2
additional points of damage (for a total of 6 points). The short sword
can cut through any material of its level or lower with ease, owing to
its exceptional sharpness. The blade sheds a blue light as bright as a
candle to warn when goblins, orcs, trolls, or similar creatures are
within 300 feet (90 m). Depletion: — 

ENCHANTED ARMOR L

evel: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Full suit of light, medium, or heavy armor 

Effect: This armor is carefully crafted and reinforced with magic to be
stronger and more protective than typical armor. It is armor according
to its type (light, medium, or heavy), but it grants an additional +1
Armor (or +2 if the artifact is level 7 or higher) beyond what it would
normally provide. For example, chainmail is medium armor (2 Armor), so
enchanted chainmail provides a total of 3 Armor (for artifact level 6 or
lower) or 4 Armor (for artifact level 7 or higher). 

The additional Armor provided by the magic also applies to damage that
often isn’t reduced by typical armor, such as heat or cold damage (but
not Intellect damage). 

Depletion: —

EXPLODING ARROW 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Arrow with runes carved on the shaft and head 

Effect: The arrow explodes when it strikes something, inflicting its
level in damage to all within immediate range. Roll d100 to determine
the type of damage.

| 01-20 | Acid                           |
|-------|--------------------------------|
| 21-40 | Electricity                    |
| 41-60 | Cold                           |
| 61-90 | Fire                           |
| 91-00 | Necromantic (harms only flesh) |

Depletion: Automatic 

One advantage of an exploding arrow over a detonation cypher is that the
arrow doesn’t count toward your cypher limit. 

An exploding arrow can instead be a crossbow bolt, sling stone, or other
thrown weapon or projectile.

EXPLORER’S GLOVES 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Thick but flexible-fingered leather gloves 

Effect: The wearer can cling to or climb any surface for up to one hour.
Even level 10 climbing tasks become routine while the gloves are
activated, but taking any other action while climbing requires a new
activation. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

FALCON CLOAK

Level: 1d6 

Form: Cloak made of feathers 

Effect: For ten hours, the wearer becomes a falcon whose level is equal
to the artifact level. The falcon can fly a long distance each round, or
up to 60 miles (97 km) per hour when traveling overland. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d100

Most magic items that turn a character into a different creature make it
difficult to use any of the character’s special abilities (other than
skills) in that form.

FLYING CARPET

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Silken rug with repeating designs bordered with a pattern that
suggests scudding clouds 

Effect: The carpet flies a long distance each round, carrying up to five
passengers. It flies for up to ten hours per activation. When traveling
overland, the artifact can achieve a flying speed of 60 miles (97 km)
per hour. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 

GHOSTLY ARMOR 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Full suit of light, medium, or heavy armor 

Effect: This armor is carefully crafted and reinforced with magic to be
stronger and more protective than typical armor. It is armor according
to its type (light, medium, or heavy), but it grants an additional +1
Armor beyond what it would normally provide. For example, chainmail is
medium armor (2 Armor), so ghostly chainmail provides 3 Armor. 

When activated, the armor randomly makes the wearer ghostly and
immaterial for ten minutes (or for one hour if the artifact is level 9
or higher), which hinders attacks on the wearer by two steps without
hindering any of the character’s abilities. Special multidimensional
weapons or attacks (such as abilities meant to harm ghosts) ignore this
defense. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d10 (for the ghostly defense ability, but after
depletion, the suit still functions as normal armor and provides its
full Armor value)

To randomly determine what kind of ghostly armor is found, see Chapter
4: Medieval Fantasy Equipment, page 34. 

GLOVES OF AGILITY 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Supple leather or cloth gloves 

Effect: The gloves enhance the dexterity and reflexes of the wearer.
This increases the wearer’s maximum Speed Pool by 5 (or by 7 if the
artifact is level 6 or higher). If the wearer removes the gloves, any
excess Speed points above their normal maximum Speed Pool are lost; if
they wear the gloves again, the points do not automatically return (they
must be restored with recovery rolls, healing magic, or similar
effects). 

Depletion: — 

GRUELMAKER 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Clay bowl stamped with symbols of fish and birds 

Effect: The bowl fills itself to the brim with a bland-tasting tan
porridge that provides enough nutrition for one person for one day (or
two people if the artifact is level 5 or higher). 

Depletion: 1 in 1d10 

GUARDIAN IDOL 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Demonic idol on top of a thin metal leg that is 1 foot (30 cm)
tall 

Effect: It takes two rounds to balance this artifact on its metal leg,
and then it requires an action to activate. When activated, the idol
stares at the activating character and nearby creatures for five rounds,
memorizing their faces and shapes. After that, if anything the idol
doesn’t recognize (and is larger than a mouse) comes within long range,
it spits a small ball of fire at the target. The fire inflicts damage
equal to the artifact level. The idol can attack up to ten times per
round, but it never attacks the same target more than once per round. It
remains on watch for twenty-four hours or until it has made one hundred
attacks, whichever comes first.  
Depletion: Automatic

HAND OF GLORY 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Dried humanoid hand with candle-tip fingers 

Effect: A hand of glory has several potential uses, including the
following. In all cases, the candles making up the hand must be lit and
burning to produce an effect. Insensibility: A target within short range
is held motionless and unable to take actions as long as the lit hand
remains within range (or until the target is attacked or otherwise
snapped out of the trance). Invisibility: User is invisible for up to
one minute while holding the hand. While invisible, the user is
specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. Thief ’s Passage: A
locked or barred door or a container whose level is less than or equal
to the hand’s level becomes unlocked when touched by the hand. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 

HELM OF WATER BREATHING 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Green metal helm with a scaly or fishy motif Effect: The wearer’s
head is enveloped in a tight bubble of air that constantly renews
itself, allowing them to breathe underwater indefinitely, speak
normally, and so on. 

Depletion: 1–2 in 1d100 (check each day) 

HORN OF THUNDER 

Level: 1d6 + 4 

Form: Large signal horn banded with metal and carved with runes 

Effect: This massive instrument can barely be held or carried by a
single person. When activated, it emits a 50-foot (15 m) wide cone of
pure sonic force out to long range. Any creature in that area is knocked
prone and stunned for one round, losing its action. Unfixed items the
size of a human or smaller are toppled and/or moved at least 5 feet (1.5
m). Larger objects might also be toppled. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

INSTANT LADDER 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Small lightweight metal rod with gem buttons 

Effect: When activated, the rod extends and produces rungs so that it
can be used as a ladder up to 28 feet (9 m) long. The ladder can be
transformed back into its rod form from either end. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d100 

A creature unfamiliar with the buttons on an instant ladder needs to
spend several rounds figuring out the proper sequence to expand or
collapse it.

LIGHTNING HAMMER 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: Massive silver hammer that crackles with electricity 

Effect: This hammer functions as a normal heavy weapon. However, if the
wielder uses an action to activate it, the weapon radiates electricity
for one round. If used to attack on the next round, the hammer inflicts
an additional 10 points of electricity damage. The user can choose to
strike the ground instead, sending shockwaves of electricity outward
that deal 5 points of damage to everyone within short range. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (still usable as a normal heavy weapon after
depletion)

MASTERCRAFT ARMOR 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Armor of exceptional quality 

Effect: This armor grants its wearer an asset for Speed defense rolls. 

Depletion: — 

MASTERCRAFT WEAPON 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Weapon of exceptional quality 

Effect: This weapon grants its wielder an asset for attack rolls made
with it. 

Depletion: — 

Depending on the game world, mastercraft armor and weapons might be
magical, mundanely crafted with exceptional quality, or both. To
randomly determine what kind of mastercraft armor or weapon is found,
see Chapter 4: Medieval Fantasy Equipment, page 34.

MINDSHIELD HELMET 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: Lightweight cloth, leather, or metal helmet 

Effect: The wearer gains 3 Armor that protects against Intellect damage
only. Further, attempts to affect the wearer’s mind are hindered (or
hindered by two steps if the artifact is level 7 or higher). 

Depletion: — 

NECROMANTIC WAND 

Level: 1d6 + 4 

Form: Bone wand carved with runes 

Effect: This wand emits a faint short-range beam of sickly violet light
that affects only organic creatures and materials. Living targets hit by
the beam move one step down the damage track. Nonliving organic targets
are likely destroyed. 

This device is a rapid-fire weapon and thus can be used with the Spray
or Arc Spray abilities that some characters have, but each “round of
ammo” used or each additional target selected requires an additional
depletion roll. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

PACK OF STORAGE 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: Leather backpack or haversack with multiple pockets

Effect: This pack’s mouth can be loosened to open as wide as 6 feet (2
m) in diameter. It is larger on the inside than on the outside, and can
carry up to 500 pounds (226 kg) or 10 cubic feet (.3 cubic m). The pack
weighs about one-tenth as much as it is holding. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d100 (check each time something is added to the pack;
on depletion, all objects are expelled from the pack) 

POISONER’S TOUCH 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: Very thin transparent glove with faint markings

Effect: When the wearer activates the glove (which might require
speaking a command word or tracing a specific pattern on its surface),
it secretes a small amount of poison. The next creature the wearer
touches with the glove takes Speed damage equal to the artifact level
(ignores Armor) and must make a new Might defense roll each round or
suffer the damage again until either they succeed at the defense roll or
five rounds pass, whichever comes first. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d10 

PROTECTION AMULET 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Stylized amulet worn on a chain 

Effect: The amulet reduces one type of damage by an amount equal to the
artifact level. Roll a d20 to determine the kind of damage the amulet
protects against.

| 1-4   | Acid        |
|-------|-------------|
| 5-8   | Cold        |
| 9-12  | Electricity |
| 13-16 | Fire        |
| 17-20 | Poison      |

Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (check each time the amulet reduces damage)

RING OF FALL FLOURISHING 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Gold band inscribed with feather wreath 

Effect: The wearer of the ring can fall any distance safely, landing
easily and upright. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d100 

RING OF INVISIBILITY 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Gold band inscribed with characters that are revealed only if ring
is heated 

Effect: The wearer of the ring becomes invisible for one minute. While
invisible, the wearer is specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks.
The effect ends if they attack or spend points from a Pool for any
reason. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 

RING OF WISHES 

Level: 1d6 + 4 

Form: Plain gold band 

Effect: The user makes a wish, and it is granted, within limits. The
level of the effect granted is no greater than the level of the
artifact, as determined by the GM, who can modify the effect
accordingly. (The larger the wish, the more likely the GM will limit its
effect.) 

Depletion: 1–3 in 1d6 

SHIELD OF TWO SKIES 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: Small hexagonal amulet 

Effect: Upon activation, the amulet creates a faint glow around the
wearer that provides +2 to Armor against heat and cold (or +3 for
artifact level 6 and higher). The effect lasts for ten minutes. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d100

SKILL RING

Level: 1d6 

Form: Ring carved with sigils appropriate to its granted skill 

Effect: This ring grants its wearer knowledge of a specific skill, such
as climbing, jumping, history, or persuasion. This grants the wearer
training in that skill (or in two skills if the artifact is level 5 or
higher). 

Depletion: — 

SMOOTH-STEPPING BOOTS 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: Pair of boots 

Effect: When the boots are activated, for the next hour the wearer can
move across rough or difficult terrain at normal speed, walk up walls,
and even walk across liquids. In areas of low or no gravity, the wearer
can walk along hard surfaces (even vertically or upside down) as if
under normal gravity. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d100 

SOUL-STEALING KNIFE 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Night-black blade in which distant stars are sometimes visible 

Effect: This knife functions as a normal light weapon. However, if the
wielder wishes, on a successful attack, it inflicts additional damage
(ignores Armor) equal to the artifact’s level. If damage from the dagger
reduces a target to 0 health, the target’s soul is drawn into the blade.
The soul remains trapped there for up to three days, after which time it
is consumed. (Alternatively, the wielder can release the soul to
whatever its fate would otherwise be.) 

As a separate activation, the wielder can ask three questions of a
creature whose soul is trapped in the blade and not yet consumed. After
answering the third question, the soul is consumed. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each activation)

SOVEREIGN KEY 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: Slender golden key 

Effect: When touched to a lock or the surface of a sealed object (such
as a chest, envelope, or urn), the key briefly glows and attempts to
open the target. Sealed objects fall open like peeled fruits if their
level is equal to or less than the artifact level, and locks open easily
if their level is equal to or less than the artifact level. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d10 

SPELLBOOK OF ELEMENTAL SUMMONING 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: Weighty tome filled with pages of spell runes 

Effect: When the user incants from the spellbook and succeeds at a level
3 Intellect task, they can summon an elemental of one specific kind
described in the book (earth, fire, thorn, or some other type). The
elemental appears and does the summoner’s bidding for up to one hour,
unless it somehow breaks the geas created by the book. 

Depletion: 1–3 in 1d20

STAFF OF BLACK IRON 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: Staff of black iron set with an eye-shaped crystal headpiece 

Effect: The wielder can use an action to gain one of the following
effects. 

Influence: The wielder makes a mental attack on a creature within
immediate range by providing a suggestion. An affected target follows
any suggestion during its next turn that doesn’t cause direct harm to
itself or its allies. 

Lightning: The wielder discharges a bolt of lightning that attacks all
targets along a straight line out to long range, inflicting damage equal
to the artifact level. 

Shield: For one hour, the wielder gains the protective effect of using a
normal shield (an asset on their Speed defense rolls). This effect is
invisible and doesn’t require them to hold a shield; merely touching the
staff is sufficient. 

The staff can have more than one effect ongoing at a time (such as using
the shield ability and blasting someone with lightning), but each
requires a separate activation and depletion roll.

Depletion: 1 in 1d100 

STAFF OF HEALING

Level: 1d6 + 4 

Form: Wooden staff capped with a golden icon 

Effect: The staff emits a short-range beam of silvery light that affects
only living creatures. A living creature hit by the beam moves up one
step on the damage track. A target that is not down on the damage track
can immediately make a free recovery roll (or, for NPCs, regain a number
of points of health equal to three times their level). 

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

STAFF OF THE PROPHET 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: Short wooden staff 

Effect: The staff has three abilities, each of which requires an action
to activate. 

Sea Passage. Creates a dry route through a body of water. The route is
approximately 20 feet (6 m) wide, up to 1,000 feet (300 m) deep, and as
long as the body of water is wide. The path remains open for up to four
hours, or the wielder can collapse it as an action. 

Snake Form. Staff transforms into a venomous snake whose level is equal
to the artifact level. The snake has a bite attack that inflicts 6
points of damage, plus 3 additional points of Speed damage (ignores
Armor) for three rounds on a failed Might defense roll. The snake obeys
the wielder’s verbal commands, but it can’t do anything a regular snake
couldn’t do.  
Water From Stone. Produces approximately 10 gallons (38 liters) of pure
water within immediate range, as if from a natural spring in the
ground. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 

STORM SHACK 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Miniature model of a simple wooden shack 

Effect: Activating the artifact transforms it over the next few rounds
into a simple wooden shack that is 10 feet by 10 feet (3 m by 3 m) with
a thin door. Everything inside the area of the full-size shack is
protected from most forms of inclement weather for one hour (or ten
hours for artifact level 6 and higher). Leaving or entering the shack
before the duration is up makes it harmlessly collapse upon itself
unless the character succeeds on a Speed roll against the artifact’s
level. If collapsed early or the duration runs out, the shack collapses
into sticks, dust, and the miniature model, which can be taken and
reused. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d100

TRAP RUNESTONE 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Pouch with chalk, sealing wax, and an engraved runestone 

Effect: A simple cypher (such as a potion or scroll) can be modified
with this set of implements to turn it into a trap. First, the cypher is
attached to a surface with the sealing wax, then the user must make a
difficulty 4 Intellect task to draw the runestone symbols around the
edge of the cypher with the chalk and place the runestone in the correct
position. When the trap is triggered, the cypher is activated, so people
often use straightforward cyphers such as an explosive spell scroll, a
poisonous potion, and so on. 

The trigger can react to a specified movement within 3 feet (1 m)—a door
opening, a creature or object moving past the runestone, and so on. The
higher the level of the artifact, the more sophisticated the trigger.
For example, a level 4 artifact’s trigger might be based on a creature’s
size or weight, a level 5 artifact can trigger based on a specific type
of creature, and a level 6 artifact can trigger based on recognizing an
individual creature. 

Depletion: Automatic 

TUNNELING GAUNTLETS 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: Oversized pair of metallic gauntlets with broad nails 

Effect: When activated, for one hour the gauntlets let the wearer burrow
up to an immediate distance each round. They can burrow through most
soils and even some stone, but only through material whose level is
lower than the artifact level. Burrowing leaves behind a tunnel with a
diameter of 5 feet (1.5 m) that remains stable for several hours. After
that, the tunnel is subject to collapse. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

VORPAL SWORD 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Long sword that sometimes whispers and snickers aloud 

Effect: The vorpal sword cuts through any material of a level lower than
its own. It is a medium weapon that ignores Armor of a level lower than
its own. On a natural attack roll of 19 or 20, the suggested minor or
major effect is decapitation if the artifact is higher level than the
foe (use this only if the foe has a head; otherwise, choose a different
effect). 

Depletion: 1–2 in 1d100 (check each decapitation and specific attempt to
cut through solid material) 

WAND OF SPIDER’S WEBBING 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: White oak wand 

Effect: This wand produces a long-range stream of grey spider’s webbing
that entangles a target and holds it stuck to nearby surfaces. Entangled
victims can’t move or take actions that require movement. Targets whose
level is higher than the wand’s level can usually break free within one
or two rounds. The entangling web is highly flammable, and if ignited it
burns away over the course of one round, but the intense heat inflicts
damage equal to the artifact level on whatever was caught within it. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 

WHISPERER IN THE ETHER 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: Small crystal 

Effect: The bearer of this crystal can telepathically communicate with
an immortal being whose location is unknown (probably another dimension
or a godly or infernal realm). The user can converse with the
intelligence on an ongoing basis, but in general, the whisperer can
share a useful bit of information, insight, or advice about once every
day. Sometimes, this translates into an asset on one of the user’s
actions. For example, the intelligence can suggest the right phrase to
make friends with a shopkeeper to get a good deal, the right tools to
use while trying to break open a door, or the right place to put a
shield to deflect an incoming attack. Sometimes the information is more
broad, such as the right road to take to reach the next town or why a
group of monsters is attacking the caravan the bearer is guarding. 

The whisperer’s willingness and ability to converse varies considerably.
Sometimes it is quite chatty and offers advice. Other times, it must be
convinced, cajoled, or tricked into giving information. And sometimes,
it is entirely absent for reasons it will not explain. The whisperer’s
knowledge base is broad but not omniscient. It cannot see the future,
but it can often predict outcomes based on logic. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each day)

WITCH’S BROOM

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: A 6-foot (2 m) long wooden broom 

Effect: As a vehicle, the broom can be ridden a long distance each
round. On extended trips, it can move up to 100 miles (160 km) per
hour. 

The bearer can call upon the broom to grant them a powerful
hallucinogenic state that lasts for four hours, during which time all
tasks are hindered. After the hallucinations end, the bearer’s Intellect
tasks are eased for the next ten minutes. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Skills and Other Abilities

Sometimes, the rules speak directly to character creativity. For
example, players can make up their own skills. It’s possible to have a
skill called “tightrope walking” that grants a character a better chance
to walk across a tightrope, and another skill called “balance” that
gives a character a better chance to walk across a tightrope and perform
other balance actions as well. This might seem unequal at first, but the
point is to let players create precisely the characters they want.
Should you let a character create a skill called “doing things” that
makes them better at everything? Of course not. The GM is the final
arbiter not only of logic but also of the spirit of the rules, and
having one or two single skills that cover every contingency is clearly
not in the spirit.

It’s important that players play the character they want. This concept
is supported not only with the open-ended skill system but also with the
ability to get an experience point advance to tailor a character
further. Likewise, the GM should be open to allowing a player to make
small modifications to refine their character. In many cases,
particularly ones that don’t involve stat Pools, Armor, damage
inflicted, or the costs of Effort or special abilities, the answer from
the GM should probably be “Sure, why not?” If a PC ends up being really
good at a particular skill—better than they “should” be—what’s the harm?
If Dave can swim incredibly well, how does that hurt the game in terms
of the play experience or the story that develops? It doesn’t. If Helen
can pick practically any mundane lock she finds, why is that a bad
thing? In fact, it’s probably good for the game—there’s likely something
interesting on the other sides of those doors.

In a way, this is no different than adjudicating a
not-so-straightforward solution to a challenge. Sometimes you have to
say “No, that’s not possible.” But sometimes, if it makes sense, open
yourself up to the possibility.

NPCs and Death

As explained in the Rules of the Game chapter, NPCs have a health score
rather than three stat Pools. When an NPC reaches 0 health, they are
down. Whether that means dead, unconscious, or incapacitated depends on
the circumstances as dictated by you and the players. Much of this can
be based on logic. If the NPC is cut in half with a giant axe, they’re
probably dead. If they’re mentally assaulted with a telepathic attack,
they might be insane instead. If they’re hit over the head with a club,
well, that’s your call.

It depends on the intentions of those who are fighting the NPC, too. PCs
who want to knock out a foe rather than kill them can simply state that
as their intention and describe their actions differently—using the flat
of the blade, so to speak.

Creatures

Whenever possible, creatures should be handled like other NPCs. They
don’t follow the same rules as the player characters. If anything, they
should have greater latitude in doing things that don’t fit the normal
mold. A many-armed beast should be able to attack multiple foes. A
charging rhino-like animal ought to be able to move a considerable
distance and attack as part of a single action.

Consider creature size very carefully. For those that are quick and hard
to hit, hinder attacks against them. Large, strong creatures should be
easier to hit, so ease attacks against them. However, you should freely
give the stagger ability to anything twice as large as a human. This
means that if the creature strikes a foe, the target must make an
immediate Might defense roll or lose its next turn.

A creature’s level is a general indicator of its toughness, combining
aspects of power, defense, intelligence, speed, and more into one
rating. In theory, a small creature with amazing powers or extremely
deadly venom could be high level, and a huge beast that isn’t very
bright and isn’t much of a fighter could be low level. But these
examples go against type. Generally, smaller creatures have less health
and are less terrifying in combat than larger ones.

The Cypher System has no system for building creatures. There is no rule
that says a creature with a certain ability should be a given level, and
there is no rule dictating how many abilities a creature of a given
level should have. But keep the spirit of the system in mind.
Lower-level creatures are less dangerous. A level 1 creature could be
poisonous, but its venom should inflict a few points of damage at most.
The venom of a level 6 creature, however, might knock a PC down a step
on the damage track or put them into a coma if they fail a Might defense
roll. A low-level creature might be able to fly, phase through objects,
or teleport because these abilities make it more interesting but not
necessarily more dangerous. The value of such abilities depends on the
creature that uses them. In other words, a phasing rodent is not overly
dangerous, but a phasing battle juggernaut is terrifying. Basic elements
such as health, damage, and offensive or defensive powers (such as
poison, paralysis, disintegration, immunity to attacks, and so on) need
to be tied directly to level—higher-level creatures get better abilities
and more of them.

Balancing Encounters

In the Cypher System, there is no concept of a “balanced encounter.”
There is no system for matching creatures of a particular level or tasks
of a particular difficulty to characters of a particular tier. To some
people, that might seem like a bad thing. But matching character builds
to exacting challenges is not part of this game. It’s about story. So
whatever you want to happen next in the story is a fine encounter as
long as it’s fun. You’re not denying the characters XP if you make
things too easy or too difficult, because that’s not how XP are earned.
If things are too difficult for the PCs, they’ll have to flee, come up
with a new strategy, or try something else entirely. The only thing you
have to do to maintain “balance” is set difficulty within that encounter
accurately and consistently.

In a game like the Cypher System, if everyone’s having fun, the game is
balanced. Two things will unbalance the game in this context.

One or more PCs are far more interesting than the others. Note that it
says “more interesting,” not “more powerful.” If my character can do all
kinds of cool things but can’t destroy robots as efficiently as yours
does, I still might have a whole lot of fun.

The challenges the PCs face are routinely too easy or too difficult.

The first issue should be handled by the character creation rules. If
there’s a problem, it might be that poor choices were made or a player
isn’t taking full advantage of their options. If someone really doesn’t
enjoy playing their character, allow them to alter the PC or—perhaps
better—create a new one.

The second issue is trickier. As previously stated, there is no formula
that states that N number of level X NPCs are a good match for tier Y
characters. However, when the game has four or five beginning
characters, the following guidelines are generally true.

Level 1 opponents will be nothing but a nuisance, even in sizable
numbers (twelve to sixteen).

Level 2 opponents will not be a challenge unless in numbers of twelve or
more.

Level 3 opponents will be an interesting challenge in numbers of four to
eight.

Level 4 opponents will be an interesting challenge in numbers of two or
three.

A single level 5 opponent might be an interesting challenge.

A single level 6 opponent will be a serious challenge.

A single level 7 or 8 opponent will likely win in a fight.

A single level 9 or 10 opponent will win in a fight without breaking a
sweat.

But it depends on the situation at hand. If the PCs are already worn
down from prior encounters, or if they have the right cyphers, any of
the expectations listed above can change. That’s why there is no system
for balancing encounters. Just keep in mind that beginning characters
are pretty hardy and probably have some interesting resources, so you
aren’t likely to wipe out the group by accident. Character death is
unlikely unless the PCs have already been through a number of other
encounters and are worn down.

CYPHER SHORTS

Cypher Shorts are what we call quick and easy adventures for use with
the Cypher System. The idea here is an adventure with very quick
character creation and minimal GM prep, designed for a one-shot game
that can be finished in a single session of three to four hours. If a
typical campaign is an ongoing television series, think of a Cypher
Short as a movie.

Cypher Shorts is a supplement for the Cypher System. You need the Cypher
System Rulebook to play.

There are some key concepts to a Cypher Short that you’ll want to keep
in mind if you’re playing, running, or creating one for yourself. They
include:

Very simple characters that are immediately involved in the situation.
No long expository lead-ins, no “meet in a tavern” scenes.

Characters have clear objectives, and there’s no thought to character
advancement. This is a one-shot game, and we aren’t concerned about what
came before or what comes after.

There is less of a plot than there is a situation. Plot implies a linear
direction: “This happens, then this, then this.” Cypher Shorts are meant
to be framed more like: “You’re involved in this situation, so what do
you do?”

Just as players should use improvisation to react to and deal with
situations they didn’t know were coming, the GM should be ready to do
the same.

CHARACTER CREATION

Cypher Shorts use an abbreviated character creation system, even simpler
than the standard Cypher System. This is to help players move quickly,
without spending a lot of time deciding between this focus and that one.

The following character creation guidelines are very broad, designed to
work with any genre or situation. In a specific Cypher Short, it’s
likely that only the type choices will be detailed, using the
information here as a starting point. Descriptors and foci are general
enough that they’ll work with almost any scenario. Sometimes, though, a
Cypher Short might require adjustments to suit the situation.

Just like in the standard system, characters end up with a sentence to
describe themselves: “I am a \[blank\] \[blank\] who \[blanks\].” All
players start with a score of 9 in their stat Pools, with 6 points to
divide among them as they wish. They have an Edge of 1 in a stat of
their choosing. Recovery rolls are 1d6 + 1, and characters have an
Effort of 1. (Otherwise, don’t worry about tier.)

All characters start with 1 XP.

DESCRIPTORS 

A descriptor quickly and easily distinguishes the character from the
others. Ideally, no two players have the same descriptor.

Tough: Add +3 to Might Pool. You are trained in Might defense rolls.

Quick: Add +3 to Speed Pool. You are trained in Speed defense rolls.

Smart: Add +3 to Intellect Pool. You are trained in Intellect defense
rolls.

Skilled: Add +1 to Intellect Pool and choose three skills in which you
are trained. These skills cannot be related to combat or interaction.

Charming: Add +2 to Intellect Pool. You are trained in persuasion and
deception.

TYPES

This is the role the character will have in the story. Types will likely
change from genre

to genre, particularly the type names. So in this section, we’ll talk
about them in terms of the general role the character will have in the
story, not what players will write on their character sheet (although a
few example suggestions are provided).

Performing Physical Actions

This character might be called a Warrior, a Soldier, a Jock, or a
Construction Worker (just to name a few), depending on the situation.
Choose two of the following abilities:

• Use any weapon without penalty

• Wear armor without penalty

• Stun an enemy as part of your attack, forcing them to lose their next
action (costs 1 Might point)

• Trained in two of the following: climbing, jumping, running, swimming
• Add +2 to recovery rolls

Sneaking

This character might be called a Thief, a Scout, a Street Rat, or a
Slacker (just to name a few), depending on the situation. Choose two of
the following abilities:

• Trained in stealth and disguise

• Trained in perception and deception

• Trained in lockpicking and disabling alarms, traps, and other security
devices

• Add +2 to recovery rolls

Searching And Discovering 

This character might be called an Explorer, a Detective, a Scientist, or
a Middle Manager (just to name a few), depending on the situation.
Choose two of the following abilities:

• Trained in perception and Intellect defense rolls

• Trained in Might and Speed defense rolls 

• Trained in two of the following: climbing, jumping, running, swimming

• Trained in knowledge-based skills (history, biology, geography, and so
on) • Add +2 to recovery rolls

Talking

This character might be called a Diplomat, a Priest, a Con Artist, or a
Salesperson (just to name a few), depending on the situation. Choose two
of the following abilities:

• Trained in perception and deception

• Trained in intimidation and interaction 

• Distract someone, preventing them from acting for as long as you focus
on them (costs 1 Intellect point) 

• Add +2 to recovery rolls

Wielding Supernatural Powers 

This type isn’t suited to all scenarios, obviously—it depends on the
genre. This character might be called a Psychic, a Wizard, a Superhero,
or a Mutant (just to name a few), depending on the situation. The player
and GM will have to briefly work out the specifics together. Choose two
of the following abilities:

• Possess one offensive power (mental attacks, ray blasts, starting
things on fire, and so on) that affects foes up to long range and either
deals up to 4 points of damage or causes them to lose their next action.
Costs 3 stat points (probably Intellect).

• Possess one defensive power (force field, metal skin, super speed, and
so on) that either grants you +3 Armor or eases defensive tasks.

• Possess one miscellaneous power (moving things with your mind, flight,
creating a duplicate of yourself, and so on). Costs 3 stat points
(probably Intellect). You’ll have to come up with some reasonable
parameters. You can choose this option twice.

• Have two power shifts.

• Have another power shift.

FOCUS

A focus determines the actions a character might often take in the
story.

Fights: You’re a fighter. All of your attacks are eased, and you add +1
to your damage.

Plans: You think things through. You are trained in defense rolls, and
you can choose two other noncombat skills in which you are trained.

Helps: You help other characters. You can use an action to ease everyone
else’s action if they’re within short range (costs 2 Intellect points).
This can represent comforting, giving advice, or physically enabling
them, depending on the character and the situation. You’re trained in
first aid.

Provides Information: You’re very knowledgeable. You are trained in
three knowledge-based skills (history, biology, geography, and so on).
You can ask the GM a question that has a pretty simple answer and get
that answer (costs 3 Intellect points).

Provides Comedy Relief: You’re funny. You can use an action to allow
everyone to recover 2 points to their Pools in between each recovery
action you take. You’re also trained in Speed defense and stealth.

Works With Tools (or Machines): You’re trained in the use of two
different skills involving tools and machines. You can modify an
existing machine or device to do something other than its original
function (costs 2 Intellect points).

Uses Powers: This focus won’t fit every genre. You can choose one of the
abilities listed under the Wielding Supernatural Powers type. (Note: if
that is already your type, you can’t select an ability you’ve already
chosen, with the exception of miscellaneous powers.)

THE SCENARIO

When thinking about a Cypher Short scenario, think in terms of what you
would expect to see in a movie. And not just any movie, but one where
the action mostly takes place in one (probably large, hopefully
interesting and dynamic) location

SETUP

This section of a Cypher Short is a brief overview of the setting and
the premise of

the situation. The basic statement of the genre and setting should be
given to the players before they make characters.

POSSIBLE ENCOUNTERS

This section is a list of possible encounters that might happen in the
scenario, depending on what the characters do, where they go, and so on.
Cypher Shorts don’t rely on a keyed map or a detailed outline of a plot.
Think of these as the possible scenes of your movie. More than likely,
the group will have time for only five or six encounters in one session,
so feel free to pick and choose the ones that best fit the way the game
seems to be going.

Each encounter is presented with a trigger, meaning that it is triggered
by some action of the characters.

Each encounter comes with the relevant game stats: the challenges for
common tasks the PCs might attempt, the levels of NPCs involved, and
other information not related to game stats, such as the answers to the
questions the PCs might ask, the personality of any relevant NPC, and so
on.

GM INTRUSIONS

Each Cypher Short comes with a brief list of GM intrusion suggestions
that are specific to that scenario.

Remember that GM intrusions are the only way for players to earn XP in
the scenario, so they’re really important. At the same time, they will
probably spend any XP they get. So there might be more calls for rerolls
using XP in a Cypher Short adventure than you’re used to in a standard
Cypher System game.

THE CONCLUSION

Ideally, as with a movie, the end of a Cypher Short session comes to a
nice story conclusion (though not every ending needs to be a happy one).
Hopefully, the main situation has been resolved one way or another, and
the implications of what probably happens next for the characters and
the setting are self-evident. But with a Cypher Short, we don’t worry
too much about what happens next. It’s a one-shot scenario.

TRAPPED IN FLAMES 

The Premise: The characters work in a tall skyscraper. Suddenly, there’s
an explosion, and the fire alarms start ringing!

CHARACTER CREATION

The characters should be relatively mundane people. No supernatural
powers. Cypher Short character suggestions include:

Office Worker: This is probably someone with the Sneaking type. The
player should figure out the character’s name, a very short personality
brief, what company they work for, and what their job is: data entry,
customer service, accounts manager, and so on.

Middle Manager: This is probably someone with the Searching and
Discovering type. The player should figure out the character’s name, a
very short personality brief, and what company they work for.

Salesperson: The Talking type would work well for this character. The
player should figure out the character’s name, a very short personality
brief, and what company they work for.

Custodial Worker: This could be a Performing Physical Actions character,
or possibly a Searching and Discovering character. The player should
figure out the character’s name and a very short personality brief. They
have keys to most of the doors of the building and know the layout well.
They might also have something like a mop and wheeled bucket, or a cart
with various cleaning supplies, if the player wishes.

Security Guard: This is probably someone with the Performing Physical
Actions type. The player should figure out the character’s name and a
very short personality brief. They have a weapon (a nightstick, a taser,
or perhaps a handgun), and keys to most of the doors in the building.
They know the layout well.

No one has any special equipment other than the typical: a cell phone,
car keys, a half-drunk coffee, and maybe a briefcase with papers and
pens or a tablet computer.

All random people in the building are level 2 or 3 NPCs.

THE SETUP

The characters all work in a tall skyscraper that houses many different
businesses in a large city. They don’t necessarily work together or even
know each other. But they’re all in a large lobby on the twenty-fifth
floor, in front of a bank of four elevators, waiting for one to arrive.
(A custodial worker probably is cleaning nearby rather than waiting for
the elevator.) Suddenly, they hear an explosion, and the floor shudders
and shakes. The fire alarms start ringing, and the power goes out,
followed quickly by emergency lighting switching on, giving the area dim
light.

Obviously, the goal for the characters here is to get to safety. A
safety-conscious person (like a security guard) would know that the
safest thing to do is stay put, at least until the location of

the fire is known (going down into smoke and flames is how many people
die in high-rise fires).

What the PCs don’t know (yet) is that a terrorist has planted a number
of bombs in the building. One of them went off prematurely on the tenth
floor. There are more bombs, designed to bring the entire structure
down. And because the bomb exploded early, the bomber is still in the
building.

Other facts:

• The floor the PCs are on has only a few other people on it currently.

• It will take about ten minutes for first responders to arrive. They
will take positions around the base of the building, and, after
determining that the fire is on floor 10, will evacuate floors below
that and set up on floor 8. This will likely take ten to fifteen
minutes. During this time, authorities will attempt to contact anyone on
floors above 10 and tell them to stay put, so office phones and some
cell phones will start ringing. It’s very likely that more bombs will go
off at this time, with rescue workers recalled for safety.

• Emergency services will be jammed with calls. • The elevator cabs all
descend to the ground floor and no longer function.

• Whenever the fire spreads to a new floor, the sprinklers will go off.
This is enough to keep the fire from spreading too much or too quickly,
but the incendiary bombs make it impossible for the sprinklers alone to
put the fire out.

POSSIBLE ENCOUNTERS

Staying Put: People from higher floors start coming down, alone or in
small groups. Some of them claim to have information. Some of it is true
and some isn’t. Things they might try to say include:

• A gas main broke, and not only is there a fire danger, but the
building is also filling with gas. (This is false.)

• This is a terror attack! We have to get out

of here at any cost! (This is true, although this NPC has no evidence or
details, and the hysterical panic they feel probably doesn’t help.)

• Something crashed into the building! (This is false.)

• Terrorists are in the building, killing and kidnapping people. (This
is false, for the most part. There’s just one bomber, and he’s trying to
sneak out.)

• Rescue teams are on their way up. (This is false.)

• Rescue teams are landing evacuation helicopters on the roof. (This is
false. It might be a tactic they try eventually, but it’s not happening
yet.)

Most of the NPCs coming down from above continue down the stairs to
lower floors, with or without the PCs.

Checking cell phones: PCs can reach their loved ones at first, although
this provides no real information. If they’re able to get through to
emergency services, they are told that emergency responders are on their
way and to stay put. It’s too soon to get much information from the
internet, although a few minutes after it happens, there are reports of
an explosion in the building on either floor 10 or floor 12. Building
Wi-Fi is down. Data and phone usage becomes spotty about five minutes
after the explosion and can’t be relied upon.

Going Up a Stairwell to the Roof: There is a pregnant person on the
stairway who can’t be moved. Helping them deliver the baby safely is a
difficulty 3 Intellect-based task and will take about twenty minutes.

Reaching the Roof: There are a few other people on the roof, but no
rescue workers. Eventually,

a small helicopter flies overhead, and if the bomber is not visibly
present, it will circle but not land. This is the terrorist’s accomplice
in a small two-person helicopter. The pilot is level 3 and has body
armor (+2 Armor), a handgun, and a knife. If the bomber is present, the
helicopter will land very briefly to try to rescue him.

Going Down a Stairwell: The PCs hear cries for help as they pass by a
floor. If they investigate, they find an office close to the stairs
where someone is trapped underneath a very heavy shelving unit. It is a
difficulty 4 task to rescue them. They are level 2 and their leg is
quite injured.

Going Further Down the Stairwell: Three people stand in the stairwell
and tell the PCs to go back up. They say it’s not safe to try to
evacuate, and the PCs should go back up to higher floors. They won’t
take no for an answer. They will argue with the characters, and trying
to win that argument is a difficulty 7 task. They will use force to back
up their point—they won’t try to harm the PCs, but they will try to
physically block the characters. Getting past them is a difficulty 5
task. Individually, they are each level 3.

Going Even Further Down the Stairwell: Smoke! The stairwell is quickly
becoming a chimney, even before the PCs get close to the tenth floor.
Visibility is almost nil (treat as complete darkness) and characters
must succeed at Might defense rolls each round or suffer 2 points of
damage and lose their next action. The difficulty level starts at 2 but
increases by 1 every other round.

Fire! If the PCs descend to the eleventh floor, they find fire rages
there (and it extends down to the ninth). The explosive(s) are
incendiary and designed to start hot fires that can eventually bring the
building down. Characters on thesefloors must make Speed defense rolls
each round or suffer 6 points of damage. Even characters who succeed at
their rolls suffer 3 points of damage from the heat, flames, smoke, and
lack of oxygen.

Firefighters to the Rescue: Eventually, the firefighters make a clear
and relatively safe path out of the building through one of the
stairwells, and they work to get everyone out. This is a great time for
one last GM intrusion, or for the PCs who have seen the bomber to spot
him trying to sneak out posing as a victim—perhaps as they exit the
building.

GM INTRUSIONS

Explosion: First and foremost, the GM’s best tools in this scenario are
the subsequent explosions from more bombs. The bomber has planted many
bombs throughout the building, and they can go off any time, any place.
This isn’t just one GM intrusion, but several, and they come in two
varieties:

Close explosion: One or more PCs are threatened by falling debris
(difficulty 5). Speed defense rolls are required; otherwise, victims
suffer 6 points of damage and are trapped and need to work to get free.

Very close explosion: All PCs must succeed at Speed defense rolls or
suffer damage as mentioned above. Even those who succeed suffer 3 points
of damage. Plus, there are smoke and fire dangers in the immediate area,
as described in the “Going Even Further Down the Stairwell” encounter.
Wherever the PCs are currently, that place is not safe. More debris will
fall, floors will collapse, and fire and smoke will spread. If the PCs
are on the roof, this might mean there’s a risk of being blown off!

The Terrorist: The PCs spot the bomber setting another bomb. He is a
level 5 NPC with body armor (+2 Armor), a handgun, and a knife. He’ll
fight, but mostly he just wants to get away. A GM intrusion allowing him
to get away from aggressive PCs means they can encounter him again
somewhere else. Eventually, he tries to get to the roof and signal his
ally in the helicopter to pick him up. Failing that, he ditches his gear
and tries to get out with the rest of the victims when the firefighters
arrive.

THE CONCLUSION

Ultimately, the PCs very likely just want to get to safety. When they
do, the scenario is pretty much over. They’re wrapped in blankets by
firefighters and loaded into ambulances. If they stopped or apprehended
the bomber, the authorities will want to talk to them, and they will be
hailed as heroes in the press.

It’s not hard to imagine how you could modify this scenario slightly for
the science fiction genre using a space station rather than a
skyscraper. You could also have one of the PCs be an undercover FBI
agent on the lookout for the terrorist, or even an undercover foreign
agent working for the terrorist
