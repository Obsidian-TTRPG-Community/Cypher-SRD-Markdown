# Exiled

You have walked a long and lonely road, leaving your home and your life behind. You might have committed a heinous crime, something so awful that your people forced you out, and if you dare return, you face death. You might have been accused of a crime you didn’t commit and now must pay the price for someone else’s wicked deed. Your exile might be the result of a social gaffe—perhaps you shamed your family or a friend, or you embarrassed yourself in front of your peers, an authority, or someone you respect. Whatever the reason, you have left your old life behind and now strive to make a new one.

**You gain the following characteristics**:

**Self-Reliant**:

+2 to your Might Pool.

**Loner**:

You gain no benefit when you get help with a task from another character who is trained or specialized in that task.

**Skill**:

You’re trained in all tasks involving sneaking.

**Skill**:

You’re trained in all tasks involving foraging, hunting, and finding safe places to rest or hide.

**Inability**:

Living on your own for as long as you have makes you slow to trust others and awkward in social situations. Any task involving social interaction is hindered.

**Additional Equipment**:

You have a memento from your past—an old picture, a locket with a few strands of hair inside, or a lighter given to you by someone important. You keep the object close at hand and pull it out to help you remember better times.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure**:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. The other PCs earned your trust by helping you when you needed it. You accompany them to repay them.
2. While exploring on your own, you discovered something strange. When you traveled to a settlement, the PCs were the only ones who believed you, and they have accompanied you to help you deal with the problem.
3. One of the other PCs reminds you of someone you used to know.
4. You have grown weary of your isolation. Joining the other PCs gives you a chance to belong.
