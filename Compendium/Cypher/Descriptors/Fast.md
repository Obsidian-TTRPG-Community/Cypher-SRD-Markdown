# Fast

You’re [[Compendium/Cypher/Abilities/F/Fleet-of-Foot|fleet of foot]]. Because you’re quick, you can accomplish tasks more rapidly than others can. You’re not just quick on your feet, however—you’re quick with your hands, and you think and react quickly. You even talk quickly.

**You gain the following characteristics**:

**Energetic**:

+2 to your Speed Pool.

**Skill**:

You are trained in running.

**Fast**:

You can move a short distance and still take another action in the same round, or you can move a long distance as your action without needing to make any kind of roll.

**Inability**:

You’re a sprinter, not a long-distance runner. You don’t have a lot of stamina. Might defense rolls are hindered.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure**:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. You jumped in to save one of the other PCs who was in dire need.
2. One of the other PCs recruited you for your unique talents.
3. You’re impulsive, and it seemed like a good idea at the time.
4. This mission ties in with a personal goal of your own.
