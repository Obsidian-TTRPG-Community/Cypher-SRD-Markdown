# Beneficent

Helping others is your calling. It’s why you’re here. Others delight in your outgoing and charitable nature, and you delight in their happiness. You’re at your best when you’re aiding people, either by explaining how they can best overcome a challenge or by demonstrating how to do so yourself.

**You gain the following characteristics**:

**Generous**:

Allies who have spent the last day with you add +1 to their recovery rolls.

**Altruistic**:

If you’re standing next to a creature that takes damage, you can intercede and take 1 point of that damage yourself (reducing the damage inflicted on the creature by 1 point). If you have Armor, it does not provide a benefit when you use this ability.

**Skill**:

You’re trained in all tasks related to pleasant social interaction, putting other people at ease, and gaining trust.

**Helpful**:

Whenever you help another character, that character gains the benefit as if you were trained even if you are not trained or specialized in the attempted task.

**Inability**:

While you are alone, all Intellect and Speed tasks are hindered.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure**:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. Even though you didn’t know most of the other PCs beforehand, you invited yourself along on their quest.
2. You saw the PCs struggling to overcome a problem and selflessly joined them to help.
3. You’re nearly certain the PCs will fail without you.
4. The choice was between your tattered life and helping others. You haven’t looked back since.
