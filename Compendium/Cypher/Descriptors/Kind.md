# Kind

It’s always been easy for you to see things from the point of view of other people. That ability has made you sympathetic to what they really want or need. From your perspective, you’re just applying the old proverb that “it’s easier to catch flies with honey than with vinegar,” but others simply see your behavior as kindness. Of course, being kind takes time, and yours is limited. You’ve learned that a small fraction of people don’t deserve your time or kindness—true sadists, narcissists, and similar folk will only waste your energy. So you deal with them swiftly, saving your kindness for those who deserve it and can benefit from your attention.

**You gain the following characteristics**:

**Emotionally Intuitive**:

+2 to your Intellect Pool.

**Skill**:

You know what it’s like to go a mile in someone else’s shoes. You’re trained in all tasks related to pleasant social interaction and discerning the dispositions of others.

**Karma**:

Sometimes, strangers just help you out. To gain the aid of a stranger, you must use a one action, ten-minute, or one-hour recovery roll (without gaining its healing benefit), and the GM determines the nature of the aid you gain. Usually, the act of kindness isn’t enough to turn a bad situation completely around, but it may moderate a bad situation and lead to new opportunities. For example, if you are captured, a guard loosens your bonds slightly, brings you water, or delivers a message.

**Inability**:

Being kind comes with a few risks. All tasks related to detecting falsehoods are hindered.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure**:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. A PC needed your help, and you agreed to come along as a kindness.
2. You gave the wrong person access to your money, and now you need to make some back.
3. You’re ready to take your benevolence on the road and help more people than you could if you didn’t join the PCs.
4. Your job, which seemed like it would be personally rewarding, is the opposite. You join the PCs to escape the drudgery.
