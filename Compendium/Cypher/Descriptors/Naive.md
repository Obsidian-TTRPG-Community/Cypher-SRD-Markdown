# Naive

You’ve lived a sheltered life. Your childhood was safe and secure, so you didn’t get a chance to learn much about the world—and even less chance to experience it. Whether you were training for something, had your nose in a book, or just were sequestered in a secluded place, you haven’t done much, met many people, or seen many interesting things so far. That’s probably going to change soon, but as you go forward into a larger world, you do so without some of the understanding that others possess about how it all works.

**You gain the following characteristics**:

**Fresh**:

You add +1 to your recovery rolls.

**Incorruptible**:

You are trained in Intellect defense tasks and all tasks that involve resisting temptation.

**Skill**:

You’re wide-eyed. You are trained in perception tasks.

**Inability**:

Any task that involves seeing through deceptions or determining someone’s secret motive is hindered.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure**:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. Someone told you that you should get involved.

4. Sounded like fun.
