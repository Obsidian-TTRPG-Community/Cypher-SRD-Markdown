# Charming

You’re a smooth talker and a charmer. Whether through seemingly supernatural means or just a way with words, you can convince others to do as you wish. Most likely, you’re physically attractive or at least highly charismatic, and others enjoy listening to your voice. You probably pay attention to your appearance, keeping yourself well-groomed. You make friends easily. You play up the personality facet of your Intellect stat; intelligence is not your strong suit. You’re personable, but not necessarily studious or strong-willed.

**You gain the following characteristics**:

**Personable**:

+2 to your Intellect Pool.

**Skill**:

You’re trained in all tasks involving positive or pleasant social interaction.

**Skill**:

You’re trained when using special abilities that influence the minds of others.

**Contact**:

You have an important contact who is in an influential position, such as a minor noble, the captain of the town guard/police, or the head of a large gang of thieves. You and the GM should work out the details together.

**Inability**:

You were never good at studying or retaining facts. Any task involving lore, knowledge, or understanding is hindered.

**Inability**:

Your willpower is not one of your strong points. Defense actions to resist mental attacks are hindered.

**Additional Equipment**:

You’ve managed to talk your way into some decent discounts and bonuses in recent weeks. As a result, you have enough cash jangling in your pocket to purchase a moderately priced item.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure**:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. You convinced one of the other PCs to tell you what they were doing.
2. You instigated the whole thing and convinced the others to join you.
3. One of the other PCs did a favor for you, and now you’re repaying that obligation by helping them with the task at hand.
4. There is a reward involved, and you need the money.
