# Intuitive

You are often tickled by a sense of knowing what someone will say, how they will react, or how events might unfold. Maybe you have a mutant sense, maybe you can see just a few moments ahead through time, or maybe you’re just good at reading people and extrapolating a situation. Whatever the case, many who look into your eyes immediately glance away, as if afraid of what you might see in their expression.

**You gain the following characteristics**:

**Innate**:

+2 to your Intellect Pool.

**Skill**:

You are trained in perception tasks.

**Know What to Do**:

You can act immediately, even if it’s not your turn. Afterward, on your next regular turn, any action you take is hindered. You can do this one time, although the ability is renewed each time you make a recovery roll.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure**:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. You just knew you had to come along.
2. You convinced one of the other PCs that your intuition is invaluable.
3. You felt that something terrible would happen if you didn’t go.
4. You’re confident the reason you arrived at this point will soon become clear.
