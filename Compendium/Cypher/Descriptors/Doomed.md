# Doomed

You are quite certain that your fate is leading you, inextricably, toward a terrible end. This fate might be yours alone, or you might be dragging along the people closest to you.

**You gain the following characteristics**:

**Jumpy**:

+2 to your Speed Pool.

**Skill**:

Always on the lookout for danger, you are trained in perception-related tasks.

**Skill**:

You are defense minded, so you are trained in Speed defense tasks.

**Skill**:

You are cynical and expect the worst. Thus, you are resistant to mental shocks. You are trained in Intellect defense tasks having to do with losing your sanity or equanimity.

**Doom**:

Every other time the GM uses GM intrusion on your character, you cannot refuse it and do not get an XP for it (you still get an XP to award to another player). This is because you are doomed. The universe is a cold, uncaring place, and your efforts are futile at best.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure**:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. You attempted to avoid it, but events seemed to conspire to draw you to where you are.
2. Why not? It doesn’t matter. You’re doomed no matter what you do.
3. One of the other PCs saved your life, and now you’re repaying that obligation by helping them with the task at hand.
4. You suspect that the only hope you have of avoiding your fate might lie on this path.
