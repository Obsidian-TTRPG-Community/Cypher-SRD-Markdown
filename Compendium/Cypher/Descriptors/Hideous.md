# Hideous

You are physically repugnant by almost any human standard. You might have had a serious accident, a harmful mutation, or just poor genetic luck, but you are incontrovertibly ugly.

You’ve more than made up for your appearance in other ways, however. Because you have to hide your appearance, you excel at sneaking about unnoticed or disguising yourself. But perhaps most important, being ostracized while others socialized, you took the time growing up to develop yourself as you saw fit—you grew strong or quick, or you honed your mind.

**You gain the following characteristics**:

**Versatile**:

You get 4 additional points to divide among your stat Pools.

**Skill**:

You are trained in intimidation and any other fear-based interactions, if you show your true face.

**Skill**:

You are trained in disguise and stealth tasks.

All tasks relating to pleasant social interaction are hindered.

3. One of the other PCs invited you, but you wonder if it was out of pity.
4. You bullied your way in with intimidation and bluster.
