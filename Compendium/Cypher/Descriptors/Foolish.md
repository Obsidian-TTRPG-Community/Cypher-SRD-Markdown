# Foolish

Not everyone can be brilliant. Oh, you don’t think of yourself as stupid, and you’re not. It’s just that others might have a bit more . . . wisdom. Insight. You prefer to barrel along headfirst through life and let other people worry about things. Worrying’s never helped you, so why bother? You take things at face value and don’t fret about what tomorrow might bring.

People call you “idiot” or “numbskull,” but it doesn’t faze you much.

(It can be liberating and really fun to play a foolish character. In some ways, the pressure to always do the right, smart thing is off. On the other hand, if you play such a character as a bumbling moron in every situation, that can become annoying to everyone else at the table. As with everything, moderation is the key.)

**You gain the following characteristics**:

**Unwise**:

–4 to your Intellect Pool.

**Carefree**:

You succeed more on luck than anything. Every time you roll for a task, roll twice and take the higher result.

**Intellect Weakness**:

Any time you spend points from your Intellect Pool, it costs you 1 more point than usual.

**Inability**:

Any Intellect defense task is hindered.

**Inability**:

Any task that involves seeing through a deception, an illusion, or a trap is hindered.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure**:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. Who knows? Seemed like a good idea at the time.
2. Someone asked you to join up with the other PCs. They told you not to ask too many questions, and that seemed fine to you.
3. Your parent (or a parental/mentor figure) got you involved to give you something to do and maybe “teach you some sense.”
4. The other PCs needed some muscle who wouldn’t overthink things.
