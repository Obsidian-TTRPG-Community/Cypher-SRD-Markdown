# Clever

You’re quick-witted, thinking well on your feet. You understand people, so you can fool them but are rarely fooled. Because you easily see things for what they are, you get the lay of the land swiftly, size up threats and allies, and assess situations with accuracy. Perhaps you’re physically attractive, or maybe you use your wit to overcome any physical or mental imperfections.

+2 to your Intellect Pool.

**Skill**:

You’re trained in all interactions involving lies or trickery.

**Skill**:

You’re trained in defense rolls to resist mental effects.

**Skill**:

You’re trained in all tasks involving identifying or assessing danger, lies, quality, importance, function, or power.

You see through the schemes of others and occasionally convince them to believe you—even when, perhaps, they should not. Thanks to your clever behavior, you have an additional expensive item.
