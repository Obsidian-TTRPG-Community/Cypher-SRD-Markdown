# Hardy

Your body was built to take abuse. Whether you’re pounding down stiff drinks while holding up a bar in your favorite watering hole or trading blows with a thug in a back alley, you keep going, shrugging off hurts and injuries that might slow or incapacitate a lesser person. Neither hunger nor thirst, cut flesh nor broken bone can stop you. You just press on through the pain and continue.

As fit and healthy as you are, the signs of wear show in the myriad scars crisscrossing your body, your thrice-broken nose, your cauliflower ears, and any number of other disfigurements you wear with pride.

**You gain the following characteristics**:

**Mighty**:

+4 to your Might Pool.

**Fast Healer**:

You halve the time it takes to make a recovery roll (minimum one action).

**Almost Unstoppable**:

While you are impaired on the damage track, you function as if you were hale. While you are debilitated, you function as if you were impaired. In other words, you don’t suffer the effects of being impaired until you become debilitated, and you never suffer the effects of being debilitated. You still die if all your stat Pools are 0.

**Skill**:

You are trained in Might defense actions.

**Inability**:

Your big, strong body is slow to react. Any task involving initiative is hindered.

**Ponderous**:

When you apply Effort when making a Speed roll, you must spend 1 extra point from your Speed Pool.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure**:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. The PCs recruited you after learning about your reputation as a survivor.
2. You joined the PCs because you want or need the money.
3. The PCs offered you a challenge equal to your physical power.
4. You believe the only way the PCs will succeed is if you are along to protect them.
