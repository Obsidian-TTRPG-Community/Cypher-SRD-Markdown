# Resilient

You can take a lot of punishment, both physically and mentally, and still come back for more. It takes a lot to put you down. Neither physical nor mental shocks or damage have a lasting effect. You’re tough to faze. Unflappable. Unstoppable.

**You gain the following characteristics**:

**Resistant**:

+2 to your Might Pool, and +2 to your Intellect Pool.

**Recover**:

You can make an extra recovery roll each day. This roll is just one action. So you can make two recovery rolls that each take one action, one roll that takes ten minutes, a fourth roll that takes one hour, and a fifth roll that requires ten hours of rest.

**Skill**:

You are trained in Might defense tasks.

**Skill**:

You are trained in Intellect defense tasks.

**Inability**:

You’re hardy but not necessarily strong. Any task involving moving, bending, or breaking things is hindered.

**Inability**:

You have a lot of willpower and mental fortitude, but you’re not necessarily smart. Any task involving knowledge or figuring out problems or puzzles is hindered.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure**:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. You saw that the PCs clearly need someone like you to help them out.
2. Someone asked you to watch over one of the PCs in particular, and you agreed.
3. You are bored and desperately in need of a challenge.
4. You lost a bet—unfairly, you think—and had to take someone’s place on this mission.
