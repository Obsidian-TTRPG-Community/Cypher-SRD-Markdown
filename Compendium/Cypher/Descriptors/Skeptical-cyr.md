# Skeptical

You possess a questioning attitude regarding claims that are often taken for granted by others. You’re not necessarily a “doubting Thomas” (a skeptic who refuses to believe anything without direct personal experience), but you’ve often benefited from questioning the statements, opinions, and received knowledge presented to you by others.

**You gain the following characteristics**:

**Insightful**:

+2 to your Intellect Pool.

**Skill**:

You’re trained in identifying.

**Skill**:

You’re trained in all actions that involve seeing through a trick, an illusion, a rhetorical ruse designed to evade the issue, or a lie. For example, you’re better at keeping your eye on the cup containing the hidden ball, sensing an illusion, or realizing if someone is lying to you (but only if you specifically concentrate and use this skill).

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure**:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. You overheard other PCs holding forth on a topic with an opinion you were quite skeptical about, so you decided to approach the group and ask for proof.
2. You were following one of the other PCs because you were suspicious of him, which brought you into the action.
3. Your theory about the nonexistence of the supernatural can be invalidated only by your own senses, so you came along.
4. You need money to fund your research.
