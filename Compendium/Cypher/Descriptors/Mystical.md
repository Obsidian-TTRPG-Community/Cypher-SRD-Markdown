# Mystical

You think of yourself as mystical, attuned with the mysterious and the paranormal. Your true talents lie with the supernatural. You likely have experience with ancient lore, and you can sense and wield the supernatural—though whether that means “magic,” “psychic phenomena,” or something else is up to you (and probably up to those around you as well). Mystical characters often wear jewelry, such as a ring or an amulet, or have tattoos or other marks that show their interests.

**You gain the following characteristics**:

**Smart**:

+2 to your Intellect Pool.

**Skill**:

You’re trained in all actions involving identifying or understanding the supernatural.

You can sense whether the supernatural is active in situations where its presence is not obvious. You must study an object or location closely for a minute to get a feel for whether a mystical touch is at work.

You can perform Hedge Magic as a spell when you have a free hand and can pay the Intellect point cost.

You have a manner or an aura that others find a bit unnerving. Any task involving charm, persuasion, or deception is hindered.
