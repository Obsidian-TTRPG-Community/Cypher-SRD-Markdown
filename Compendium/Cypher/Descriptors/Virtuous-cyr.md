# Virtuous

Doing the right thing is a way of life. You live by a code, and that code is something you attend to every day. Whenever you slip, you reproach yourself for your weakness and then get right back on track. Your code probably includes moderation, respect for others, cleanliness, and other characteristics that most people would agree are virtues, while you eschew their opposites: sloth, greed, gluttony, and so on.

**You gain the following characteristics**:

**Dauntless**:

+2 to your Might Pool.

**Skill**:

You are trained in discerning people’s true motives or seeing through lies.

**Skill**:

Your adherence to a strict moral code has hardened your mind against fear, doubt, and outside influence. You are trained in Intellect defense tasks.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure**:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. The PCs are doing something virtuous, and you’re all about that.
2. The PCs are on the road to perdition, and you see it as your task to set them on the proper moral route.
3. One of the other PCs invited you, hearing of your virtuous ways.
4. You put virtue before sense and defended someone’s honor in the face of an organization or power far greater than you. You joined the PCs because they offered aid and friendship when, out of fear of reprisals, no one else would.
