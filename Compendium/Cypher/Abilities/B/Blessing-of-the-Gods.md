# Blessing of the Gods

**Type**: Enabler

As a servant of the gods, you can call up blessings in their name. This blessing depends on the godâ€™s general demeanor and area of influence. Choose two of the abilities described below.

## Authority/Law/Peace

**Points**: 3 Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

You prevent a foe that can hear and understand you from attacking anyone or anything for one round.

## Benevolence/Righteousness/Spirit

**Points**: 2+ Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

One level 1 demon, spirit, or similar creature within short range is destroyed or banished. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus, to destroy or banish a level 5 target (four levels above the normal limit), you must apply four levels of Effort.

## Death/Darkness

**Points**: 2 Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

A target you choose within short range withers, suffering 3 points of damage.

## Desire/Love/Health

**Points**: 3 Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

With a touch, you restore 1d6 points to one stat Pool of any creature, including yourself. This ability is a difficulty 2 Intellect task. Each time you attempt to heal the same creature, the task is hindered by an additional step. The difficulty returns to 2 after that creature rests for ten hours.

## Earth/Stone

**Type**: Enabler

You are trained in climbing, stonecraft, and spelunking.

## Knowledge/Wisdom

**Points**: 3 Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

Choose up to three creatures (potentially including yourself). For one minute, a particular type of task (but not an attack roll or defense roll) is eased for those creatures, but only while they remain within immediate range of you.

## Nature/Animals/Plants

**Type**: Enabler

You are trained in botany and handling natural animals.

## Protection/Silence

**Points**: 3 Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

You create a quiet bubble of protection around you to an immediate radius for one minute. The bubble moves with you. All defense rolls for you and all creatures you designate within the bubble are eased, and no noise, regardless of its origin, sounds louder than a normal speaking voice.

## Sky/Air

**Points**: 2 Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

A creature you touch is immune to airborne toxins or contaminants for ten minutes.

## Sun/Light/Fire

**Points**: 2 Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

You cause one creature or object within short range to catch fire, inflicting 1 point of ambient damage each round until the fire is extinguished (requiring an action).

## Trickery/Greed/Commerce

**Type**: Enabler

You are trained in detecting the deceptions of other creatures.

## War

**Points**: 1 Intellect Point
**Type**: Action

A target you choose within short range (potentially yourself) deals 2 additional points of damage with its next successful weapon attack.

## Water/Sea

**Points**: 2 Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

A target you touch can breathe water for ten minutes.
