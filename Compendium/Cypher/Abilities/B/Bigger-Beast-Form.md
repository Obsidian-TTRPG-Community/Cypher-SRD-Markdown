# Bigger Beast Form

**Type**: Enabler

When you use Beast Form, your beast form grows bigger than before, during which time you achieve a height of 12 feet (4 m).

Being so large, your beast form gains the following additional bonuses: +1 to Armor, +5 to your Might Pool, and you are trained in using your fists as heavy weapons (if you werenâ€™t already). However, your Speed defense tasks are hindered. While bigger, you also gain an asset to tasks that are easier for a larger creature to perform, like climbing, intimidating, wading rivers, and so on.
