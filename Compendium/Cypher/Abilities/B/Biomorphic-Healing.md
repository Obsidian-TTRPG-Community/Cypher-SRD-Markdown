# Biomorphic Healing

**Points**: 4+ Might points
**Type**: Action

You consciously send out a pulse of your biomorphic field (a strange energy your body generates) and focus it on a living creature within short range. The target gains a free and immediate one-action recovery roll. You canâ€™t use this ability again on that creature until after its next ten-hour rest.
