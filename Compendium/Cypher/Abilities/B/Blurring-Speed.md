# Blurring Speed

**Points**: 7 Speed Points
**Type**: Enabler

You move so quickly that until your next turn, you look like a blur. While you are blurred, if you apply Effort to a melee attack task or Speed defense task, you get a free level of Effort on that task; you can move a short distance as part of another action or a long distance as your entire action.
