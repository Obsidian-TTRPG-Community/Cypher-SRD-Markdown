### Thinking Ahead

(variable Intellect points)

You produce a remedy that removes a negative condition because you’ve previously spent considerable time thinking ahead and preparing for your current situation. For instance, if another character is poisoned, you produce an antidote, or if they’re blinded, you produce a salve that returns sight (assuming they weren’t blinded because their eyes were destroyed). The Intellect cost for using this ability is equal to the level of effect or creature that caused the negative condition. Action.
