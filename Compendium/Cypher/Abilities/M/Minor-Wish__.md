Golden Anger

A golden light touches your eyes. For the next several minutes, if you attack a target, you inflict 2 additional points of damage.

Golden Ward

You gain +1 to Armor for one hour from a translucent sheen of golden light.

Light of Truth

Whenever you attempt to discern falsehood during the next hour, the task is eased by two steps.

Touch of Grace
