### Mastery in Armor

The cost reduction from your Practiced in Armor ability improves. You now reduce [the Speed Effort cost for wearing armor](https://screwtapello.gitlab.io/cypher-system-reference/equipment.html#using-armor) to 0. Enabler.

Note

This implies the [Practiced in Armor](https://screwtapello.gitlab.io/cypher-system-reference/abilities.html#practiced-in-armor) ability is a pre-requisite. Therefore, you must have Practiced in order to take Mastery, and once you’ve taken Mastery you can’t switch out Practiced for a different ability.

Meanwhile, [Experienced in Armor](https://screwtapello.gitlab.io/cypher-system-reference/abilities.html#experienced-in-armor) is _not_ a pre-requisite, so you can take it without Experienced, and switch out Experienced once you have Mastery.
