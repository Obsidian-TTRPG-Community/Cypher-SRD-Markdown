### Mobile Fighter

(3 Speed points)

As part of your attack, you can leap on or over obstacles, swing from ropes, run along narrow surfaces, or otherwise move around the battlefield at your normal speed as if such tasks were routine (difficulty 0). You canâ€™t use this ability if your Speed Effort costs are reduced from wearing armor. Enabler.
