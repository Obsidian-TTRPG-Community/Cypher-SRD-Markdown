# Calm Stranger

**Points**: 2+ Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

You can cause one intelligent creature to remain calm as you speak. The creature doesnâ€™t need to speak your language, but it must be able to see you. It remains calm as long as you focus all your attention on it and it is not attacked or otherwise threatened. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to calm additional creatures allied with your initial target, one additional creature per level of Effort applied.
