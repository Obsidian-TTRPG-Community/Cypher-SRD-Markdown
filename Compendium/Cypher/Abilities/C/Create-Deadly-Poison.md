# Create Deadly Poison

**Points**: 3+ Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

You create one dose of a level 2 poison that either inflicts 5 points of damage or hinders the poisoned creatureâ€™s actions for ten minutes (your choice each time you create the poison). You can apply this poison to a weapon, food, or drink as part of the action of creating it. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the level of the poison; each level of Effort used in this way increases the poison level by 1. If unused, the poison loses its potency after one hour.
