# Conjuration

**Points**: 7 Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

You produce, as if from thin air, a level 5 creature of a kind you have previously encountered. The creature remains for one minute and then returns home. While present, the creature acts as you direct, but this requires no action on your part.
