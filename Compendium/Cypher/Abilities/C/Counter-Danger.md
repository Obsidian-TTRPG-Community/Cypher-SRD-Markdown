# Counter Danger

**Points**: 4 Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

You negate a source of potential danger related to one creature or object within immediate distance for one minute (instead of one round, as with [[Compendium/Cypher/Abilities/F/Foil-Danger|Foil Danger]]). This could be a weapon or device held by someone, a creatureâ€™s natural ability, or a trap triggered by a pressure plate. You can also try to counter an action (like moving or making a conventional mundane attack with a weapon, a claw, etc.).
