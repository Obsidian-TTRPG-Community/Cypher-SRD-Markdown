# Copy Power

**Points**: 2+ Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

You can copy someone else's superpower for an hour, performing it as if it were natural for you. Within the past hour, you must have touched the creature whose power you want to copy (an attack roll) and must have seen that ability used by them. Choose the power you want to copy, and the GM chooses an appropriate low-tier ability that most closely resembles that power. For example, if you're battling a supervillain who can create blasts of force, if you copy that ability, you gain a low-tier ability that creates a blast of force.

In addition to the point cost of Copy Power, you must pay the Might, Speed, or Intellect cost (if any) of the equivalent ability that the GM chose. For example, if you want to copy a supervillain's [[Compendium/Cypher/Abilities/F/Force-Blast|force blast]], the GM will probably decide that's equivalent to Onslaught (167), so you'd pay 2 Intellect points to activate Copy Power and 1 Intellect point to use Onslaught.

You can copy only one power at a time; copying another one ends any other power you're copying with this ability.

Copy Power doesn't copy effects of a power that permanently adds points to your Pools, such as [[Compendium/Cypher/Abilities/E/Enhanced-Body|Enhanced Body]] (134).

In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to copy an ability you saw longer than one hour ago; each level of Effort used in this way extends the time period by one hour.
