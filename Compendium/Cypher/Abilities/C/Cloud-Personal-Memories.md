# Cloud Personal Memories

**Points**: 3 Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

If you interact with or study a target for at least a round, you gain a sense of how its mind works, which you can use against it in the most blunt fashion possible. You can attempt to confuse it and make it forget whatâ€™s just happened. On a success, you erase up to the last five minutes of its memory.
