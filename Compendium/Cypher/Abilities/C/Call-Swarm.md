# Call Swarm

**Points**: 4 Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

If you’re in a location where it’s possible for the creatures from your Influence Swarm ability to come, you call a swarm of them for one hour. During this hour, they do as you telepathically command as long as they are within long range. They can swarm about and hinder any or all opponents’ tasks. While the creatures are in long range, you can speak to them telepathically and perceive through their senses.
