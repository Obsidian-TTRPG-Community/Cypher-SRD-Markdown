# Command Machine

**Points**: 4 Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

If youâ€™ve charmed an unintelligent machine or have spoken telepathically with an intelligent machine, you can attempt to command it to take one action within its capabilities on its next turn. (If you use this ability to command an intelligent machine, it likely becomes hostile to you afterward.)
