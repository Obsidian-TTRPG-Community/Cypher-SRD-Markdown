# Drain Machine

**Points**: 3+ Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

You can drain the power from an artifact or powered device you touch. If the target is a robot, you inflict 3 points of damage and restore 3 points to your Might or Speed Pool. If the target is an object, you restore points to your Might or Speed Pool equal to the level of the target. If the target is a manifest cypher, it is fully drained and useless. Artifacts and similar devices must immediately check for depletion (items with a depletion of “—” are either immune to this ability or have a depletion of 1 in 1d10 when attacked with this ability).
