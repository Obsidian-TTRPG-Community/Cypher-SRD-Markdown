# Dazzling Sunburst

**Points**: 2 Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

You send a barrage of dazzling colors at a creature within short range and, if successful, inflict 2 points of damage on the target. In addition, the creatureâ€™s attacks are hindered on its next turn, unless the target relies primarily on senses other than sight.
