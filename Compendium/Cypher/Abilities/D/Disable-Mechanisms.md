# Disable Mechanisms

**Points**: 3 Speed Points
**Type**: Action

With a keen eye and quick moves, you disrupt some functions of a robot or machine and inflict upon it one of the following maladies:
- All its tasks are hindered for one minute.
- Its speed is halved.
- It can take no action for one round.
- It deals 2 fewer points of damage (minimum 1 point) for one minute.

You must touch the robot or machine to disrupt it (if you are making an attack, it inflicts no damage).
