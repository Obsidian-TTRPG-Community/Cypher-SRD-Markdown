# Defense Master

Every time you succeed at a Speed defense task, you can make an immediate attack against your foe. (If you have [[Compendium/Cypher/Abilities/D/Dodge-and-Respond|Dodge and Respond]], you can exchange that ability for [[Compendium/Cypher/Abilities/D/Dodge-and-Resist|Dodge and Resist]].) Your attack must be the same type (melee weapon, ranged weapon, or unarmed) as the attack you defend against. If you don’t have an appropriate type of weapon ready, you can’t use this ability.
