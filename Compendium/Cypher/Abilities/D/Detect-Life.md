# Detect Life

**Points**: 3+ Might Points
**Type**: Action

You consciously send out a pulse of your life energy. You detect all living creatures within short range, even if they are behind cover, though not if they’re behind a force field. When you detect a creature, you detect its general location (to within an immediate range). If you apply two additional levels of Effort, you can increase the range of detection to long.
