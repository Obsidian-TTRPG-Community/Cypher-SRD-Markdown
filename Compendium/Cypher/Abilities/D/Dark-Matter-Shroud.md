# Dark Matter Shroud

**Points**: 4 Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

Ribbons of dark matter condense and swirl about you for up to one minute. This shroud eases your Speed defense tasks, inflicts 2 points of damage to anyone who tries to touch you or strike you with a melee attack, and gives you +1 Armor.
