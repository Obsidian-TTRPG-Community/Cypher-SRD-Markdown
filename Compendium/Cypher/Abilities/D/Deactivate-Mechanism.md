# Deactivate Mechanisms

**Points**: 5+ Speed Points
**Type**: Action

You make a melee attack that inflicts no damage against a machine. Instead, if the attack hits, make a second Speed-based roll. If successful, a machine of level 3 or lower is deactivated for one minute. For each additional level of Effort applied, you can affect one higher level of machine or you can extend the duration for an additional minute. If you have the Scramble Machine or [[Compendium/Cypher/Abilities/D/Disable-Mechanisms|Disable Mechanisms]] ability (or an ability that works similarly), when you apply a level of Effort to any of them, you gain an additional free level of Effort.
