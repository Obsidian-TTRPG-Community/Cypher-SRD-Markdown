# Double Strike

**Points**: 3 Might Points
**Type**: Action

When you wield two weapons, you can choose to make one attack roll against a foe. If you hit, you inflict damage with both weapons plus 2 additional points of damage, and because you made a single attack, the targetâ€™s Armor is subtracted only once.
