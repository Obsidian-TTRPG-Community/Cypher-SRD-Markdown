# Dream Thief

**Points**: 2 Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

You steal a previous dream from a living creature within short range. The creature loses 2 points of Intellect (ignores Armor), and you learn something the GM chooses to reveal about the creatureâ€”its nature, a portion of its plans, a memory, and so on.
