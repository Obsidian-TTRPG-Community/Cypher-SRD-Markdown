# Distant Interface

**Points**: 2 Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

You can activate, deactivate, or control a machine at long range as if you were next to it, even if normally you would have to touch or manually operate it. If you have never interacted with the particular machine before, the task is hindered by two steps. To use this ability, you must understand the function of the machine, it must be your size or smaller, and it canâ€™t be connected to another intelligence (or be intelligent itself).
