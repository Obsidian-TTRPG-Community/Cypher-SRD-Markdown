# Do You Know Who I Am?

**Points**: 3 Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

Acting only as someone who is famous and used to privilege can, you verbally harangue a living foe who can hear and understand you so forcefully that it is unable to take any action, including making attacks, for one round. Whether you succeed or fail, the next action the target takes after your attempt is hindered.
