# Dark Explorer

**Type**: Enabler

You ignore penalties for any action (including fighting) in extremely dim light or in cramped spaces. If you also have the [[Compendium/Cypher/Abilities/E/Eyes-Adjusted|Eyes Adjusted]] ability, you can act without penalty even in total darkness. You are trained in sneaking tasks while in dim or no light.
