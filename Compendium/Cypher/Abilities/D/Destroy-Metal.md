# Destroy Metal

**Points**: 3 Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

You instantly tear, rip, or burst a metal object that is within sight, within short range, and no bigger than half your size. Attempt an Intellect task to destroy the object; the task is eased by three steps compared to breaking it with brute strength.
