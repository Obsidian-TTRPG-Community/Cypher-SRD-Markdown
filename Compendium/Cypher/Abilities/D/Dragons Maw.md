# Dragon’s Maw

**Points**: 6 Intellect Points
**Type**: Action

You fashion and control a “hovering” phantasmal construct of magic within long range that resembles a dragon’s head. The construct lasts for up to an hour, until it is destroyed, or until you cast another spell. It is a level 4 construct that inflicts 6 points of damage with its bite when directed. While the construct persists, you can use it to manipulate large objects, carry heavy items in its mouth, or attack foes. If you use it to attack foes, you must use your action to directly control the phantom maw for each attack.
