# Advantages of Being Big

**Type**: Enabler

When you use Enlarge, youâ€™re so big that you can move massive objects more easily, climb buildings by using hand- and footholds unavailable to regular-sized people, and jump much farther. While you enjoy the effects of Enlarge, all climbing, lifting, and jumping tasks are eased.
