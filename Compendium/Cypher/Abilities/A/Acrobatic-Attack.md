# Acrobatic Attack

**Points**: 1+ Speed points
**Type**: Enabler

You leap into the attack, twisting or flipping through the air. If you roll a natural 17 or 18, you can choose to have a minor effect rather than deal extra damage. If you apply Effort to the attack, you get a free level of Effort on the task. You canâ€™t use this ability if your Speed Effort costs are reduced from wearing armor.
