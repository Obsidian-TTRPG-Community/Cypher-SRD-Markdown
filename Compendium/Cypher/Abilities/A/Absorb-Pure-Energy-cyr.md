# Absorb Pure Energy

**Type**: Enabler

When you use [[Compendium/Cypher/Abilities/A/Absorb-Kinetic-Energy-cyr|Absorb Kinetic Energy]], you can also absorb and store energy from attacks made with pure energy (focused light, radiation, transdimensional, psychic, etc.) or from conduits that direct energy, if you can make direct contact. This ability does not change how many points of energy you can store.

If you also have Improved Absorb Kinetic Energy, you can absorb 2 points of damage from other energy sources as well.
