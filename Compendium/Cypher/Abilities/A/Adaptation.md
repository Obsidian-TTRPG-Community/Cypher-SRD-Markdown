# Adaptation

**Type**: Enabler

Thanks to a latent mutation, a device implanted in your spine, a ritual performed with dragonâ€™s blood, or some other gift, you now remain at a comfortable temperature; never need to worry about dangerous radiation, diseases, or gases; and can always breathe in any environment (even the vacuum of space).
