# Artifact Scavenger

**Points**: 6 Intellect points + 2 XP
**Type**: Action to initiate, several hours to complete

You’ve developed a sixth sense for searching for the most valuable items in the wasteland. If you spend the time required to succeed on two scavenging tasks, you can exchange all the results you would otherwise obtain for a chance to gain an artifact of the GM’s choosing if you succeed on a difficulty 6 Intellect task. 

You can use this ability at most once per day, and never within the same general area.
