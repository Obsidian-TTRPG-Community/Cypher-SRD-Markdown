# Augment Cypher

**Points**: 2+ Intellect points
**Type**: Enabler

When you activate a cypher, add +1 to its level. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the level of the cypher by an additional +1 (per level of Effort applied).

You can’t increase the cypher’s level above 10.
