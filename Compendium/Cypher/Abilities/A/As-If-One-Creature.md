# As If One Creature

**Type**: Enabler

When you and your beast (from your [[Compendium/Cypher/Abilities/B/Beast-Companion|Beast Companion]] ability) are within immediate distance of each other, you can share damage inflicted on either of you. 

For instance, if one of you is struck by a weapon for 4 points of damage, divide the damage between the two of you as you see fit. Only the Armor and resistances of the target initially damaged come into play. 

So if you have 2 Armor and are struck by a [[Compendium/Cypher/Abilities/F/Force-Blast|force blast]] for 4 points of damage, your beast can take the 2 points of damage you would suffer, but their Armor does not come into play, nor does their immunity to force blasts, if any.
