# Amplify Sounds

**Points**: 2 Might Points
**Type**: Action to initiate, up to several rounds to complete, depending on the difficulty of the task.

For one minute, you can amplify distant or small sounds so that you can hear them clearly, even if itâ€™s a conversation or the sound of a small animal moving through an underground burrow up to a very long distance away. You can attempt to perceive the sound even if interceding barriers block it or the sound is very slight, though this requires a few additional rounds of concentration. To discriminate the sound you wish in a noisy environment might also require a few additional rounds of concentration as you audibly explore the surrounding soundscape. Given enough time, you could pinpoint every conversation, every breathing creature, and every device creating noise within range.
