# Apportation

**Points**: 4 Intellect points
**Type**: Action

You call a physical object to you. You can choose any piece of normal equipment on the standard equipment list, or (no more than once per day) you can allow the GM to determine the object randomly.

If you call a random object, it has a 10 percent chance of being a manifest cypher or artifact, a 50 percent chance of being a piece of standard equipment, and a 40 percent chance of being a bit of worthless junk.

You canâ€™t use this ability to take an item held by another creature.
