# Arcane Flare

**Points**: 1 Intellect point
**Type**: Enabler for enhancement; Action for long-range attack

You enhance the damage of another attack spell with an extra charge of energy so that it deals 1 additional point of damage. 

Alternatively, you attack a target within long range by projecting a flare of raw magic that inflicts 4 points of damage.
