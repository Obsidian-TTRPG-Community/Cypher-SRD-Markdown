# Asserting Your Privilege

**Points**: 3 Intellect points
**Type**: Action

Acting as only a privileged person can, you verbally harangue a foe who can hear and understand you so forcefully that they are unable to take any action, including attacks, for one round.

Whether you succeed or fail, the next action the target takes is hindered.
