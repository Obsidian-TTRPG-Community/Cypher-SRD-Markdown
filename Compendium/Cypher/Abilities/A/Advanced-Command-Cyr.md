# Advanced Command

**Points**: 7 Intellect points
**Type**: Action to initiate

A target within short range obeys any command you give as long as they can hear and understand you. Further, as long as you continue to do nothing but issue commands (taking no other action), you can give that same target a new command. This effect ends when you stop issuing commands or they are out of short range.
