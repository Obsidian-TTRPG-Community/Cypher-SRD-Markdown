### Illuminating Touch

(1 Intellect point)

You touch an object, and that object sheds light to illuminate everything in short range. The light remains until you use an action to touch the object again, or until youâ€™ve illuminated more objects than you have tiers, in which case the oldest objects you illuminated go dark first. Action.
