### In Harm’s Way

(3 Intellect points)

When you put your friends before yourself as your action, you ease all defense tasks for all characters you choose that are adjacent to you. This lasts until the end of your next turn. If one of your friends would be damaged, you can choose to take up to half the number of points of damage they would otherwise take, but only if you’re not already impaired or debilitated. Enabler.
