### Incredible Feat of Science

(12 Intellect points)

You do something amazing in the lab. This takes parts and materials equivalent to three expensive items. Possible incredible feats include:

-   Reanimate and command a dead body for one hour.
-   Create an engine that runs on perpetual motion.
-   Create a teleportation gate that remains open for one minute.
-   Transmute one substance into another substance.
-   Cure one person with an incurable disease or condition.
-   Create a weapon designed to hurt something that can’t otherwise be hurt.
-   Create a defense designed to protect against something that can’t otherwise be stopped.

Action to initiate; a full day of work to complete.
