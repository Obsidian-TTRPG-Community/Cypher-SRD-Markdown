### Illusory Evasion

(5 Intellect points)

When you would be hit by an attack, you teleport an immediate distance away, leaving behind an illusory copy of yourself to be struck by that attack instead of you. This destroys the illusion but leaves you unharmed by the attack. If the attack affects an area and the teleportation canâ€™t get you out of that area, the attack still affects you normally. Enabler.
