### Inspiring Ease

Through stories, songs, art, or other forms of entertainment, you inspire your friends. After spending 24 hours with you, once per day each of your friends can ease a task. This benefit is ongoing while you remain in the friend’s company. It ends if you leave, but it resumes if you return to the friend’s company within 24 hours. If you leave the friend’s company for more than 24 hours, you must spend another 24 hours together to reactivate the benefit. Enabler.
