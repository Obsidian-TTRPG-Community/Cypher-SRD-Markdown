### Winter Gauntlets

When you use Frost Touch, you inflict an additional 3 points of damage if you touch a creature, or an additional 2 points of damage if you infuse a weapon. In addition, damaged targets are frozen in place (if standing on a solid surface) and canâ€™t move from their location until they use an action to break free. The target can still attack and defend. Action for touch; enabler for weapon.
