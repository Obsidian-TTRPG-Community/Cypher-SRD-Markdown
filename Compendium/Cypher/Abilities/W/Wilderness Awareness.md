### Wilderness Awareness

(4 Intellect points)

Your connection to the natural world extends to a degree that some would call supernatural. While in the wilderness, you can extend your senses up to a mile in any direction and ask the GM a very simple, general question about that area, such as “Where is the orc camp?” or “Is my friend Deithan still alive?” If the answer you seek is not in the area, you receive no information. Action.
