### Weightless Shot

You have a sixth sense when it comes to lining up trajectories and moving in low-gravity and zero-gravity environments, which also translates to making ranged attacks. When you hit a target with a ranged attack in microgravity conditions, you can choose to reduce the damage by 2 points but hit the target in a precise spot. Some of the possible effects include (but are not limited to) the following:

-   You punch a hole in the target’s suit, so it begins to leak air into the vacuum slowly, or all at once (your choice).
-   You hit the reaction mass of the target’s maneuvering pack, which means the target can no longer change their trajectory, or they go spinning off in a random direction (your choice).
-   You can shoot a spacecraft, and degrade one ship system by one step (systems include engines, weapons, and atmosphere).
