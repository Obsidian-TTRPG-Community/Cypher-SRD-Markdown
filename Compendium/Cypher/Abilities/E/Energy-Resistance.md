# Energy Resistance

**Type**: Enabler

Choose a discrete type of energy that you have experience with (such as heat, sonic, electricity, and so on). You gain +5 to Armor against damage from that type of energy. You must be familiar with the type of energy; for example, if you have no experience with a certain kind of extradimensional energy, you canâ€™t protect against it. You can select this ability more than once. Each time you select it, you must choose a different kind of energy. Enabler.
