# Experienced in Armor

**Type**: Enabler

The cost reduction from your Practiced in Armor ability improves. You now reduce the Speed Effort cost for wearing armor by 2. 

This implies the [[Practiced-in-Armor]] ability is a pre-requisite. Therefore, you must have Practiced in order to take Experienced, and once you’ve taken Experienced you can’t switch out Practiced for a different ability.
