# Energized Shield

**Type**: Enabler

Your force shield from your [[Compendium/Cypher/Abilities/F/Force-Field-Shield|Force Field Shield]] ability now pulses with dangerous energy whenever you manifest it. Each time you use your shield as a melee or ranged weapon, it inflicts an additional 3 points of damage. Enabler.
