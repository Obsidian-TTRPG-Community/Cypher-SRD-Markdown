### Go Defensive

(1 Intellect point)

When you wish, while in combat, you can enter a state of heightened awareness of threat. While in this state, you can’t use points from your Intellect Pool, but you gain +1 to your Speed Edge and gain two assets to Speed defense tasks. This effect lasts as long as you wish or until you attack a foe or no combat is taking place within range of your senses. Once the effect of this ability ends, you can’t enter it again for one minute. Enabler.
