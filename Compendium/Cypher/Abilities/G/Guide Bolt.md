### Guide Bolt

(4+ Intellect points)

When you make an attack with a metallic bolt or metal-tipped arrow on a target within short range, you can improve the attackâ€™s aim and velocity, which grants an asset to the attack and inflicts an additional 2 points of damage. If you apply a level of Effort, you grant the same benefits to a ranged attack made by an ally within immediate range. In any case, you can use this ability only once per round. Enabler.
