### Perfect Stranger

(3 Intellect points)

You alter your posture and way of speaking and make a small but real alteration to an outfit (such as putting on or taking off a hat, reversing a cloak, and so on). For the next hour (or as long as you keep up the alteration), even creatures that know you well donâ€™t recognize you. All tasks related to hiding your true identity during this period gain one free level of Effort. Action to initiate.
