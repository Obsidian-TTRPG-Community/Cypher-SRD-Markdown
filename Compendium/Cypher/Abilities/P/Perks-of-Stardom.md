### Perks of Stardom

You are adept at claiming the rewards that fame can generate. When you are recognized, you can be seated at any restaurant, be let into any government building, be invited to any show or sports event (even if they’re sold out), get a seat at a private function of any sort, or get into any club, no matter how exclusive. When dealing with someone who can’t or won’t immediately give in to your desire, you gain an asset on all tasks related to persuasion if that person recognizes you or is convinced that you’re a celebrity even if they don’t recognize you. Enabler.
