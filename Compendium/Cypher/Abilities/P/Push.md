### Push

(2 Intellect points)

You telekinetically push a creature or object an immediate distance in any direction you wish. You must be able to see the target, which must be your size or smaller, must not be affixed to anything, and must be within short range. The push is quick, and the force is too crude to be manipulated. For example, you canâ€™t use this ability to pull a lever or close a door. Action.
