# Force Bash

**Cost**: 1 Might point
**Type**: Enabler

This is a pummeling melee attack you make with your [[Compendium/Cypher/Abilities/F/Force-Field-Shield|Force Field Shield]]. Your attack inflicts 1 less point of damage than normal but dazes your target for one round, during which time all tasks it performs are hindered. Enabler.
