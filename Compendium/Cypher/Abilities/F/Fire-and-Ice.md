# Fire and Ice

**Cost**: 4 Intellect points
**Type**: Action

You cause a target within short range to become either very hot or very cold (your choice). The target suffers 3 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor) each round for up to three rounds, although a new roll is required each round to continue to affect the target.
