# Frenzy

**Cost**: None
**Type**: Enabler

When you wish, while in combat, you can enter a state of frenzy. While in this state, you canâ€™t use Intellect points, but you gain +1 to your Might Edge and your Speed Edge. This effect lasts as long as you wish, but it ends if no combat is taking place within range of your senses. Enabler.
