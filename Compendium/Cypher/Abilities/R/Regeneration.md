### Regeneration

(6 Intellect points)

You restore points to a targetâ€™s Might or Speed Pool in one of two ways:

either the chosen Pool regains up to 6 points, or it is restored to a total value of 12. You make this decision when you initiate this ability. Points are regenerated at a rate of 1 point each round. You must remain within immediate range of the target the whole time, either touching them or conversing with them. In no case can this raise a Pool higher than its maximum. Action.
