### Remote Viewing

(6 Intellect points)

Distance is an illusion, as all space is one space. With great concentration, you can see another place. This ability can be used in one of two ways:

-   Distance and direction. Pick a spot a specific distance away and in a specific direction. You can see from that vantage point as if you had used the Sensor ability there, but only for one minute.
-   Think of a place you have seen before, either conventionally or using the other application of this power. You can see from that vantage point as if you had used the Sensor ability there, but only for one or two rounds.

Either application takes anywhere from one action to hours of concentration, depending on what the GM feels is appropriate due to time, distance, or other mitigating circumstances. However, you donâ€™t know in advance how long it will take. Action to initiate; action each round to concentrate.
