### Subsonic Rumble

(2 Intellect points)

For one minute or until you use some other sound manipulation ability, you emit a subsonic rumble that most living creatures canâ€™t hear but which has an effect on them all the same. The effect lasts for one minute and affects all creatures you select within short range. All tasks related to resisting persuasion, intimidation, and fear are hindered by two steps for affected targets. Action to initiate.
