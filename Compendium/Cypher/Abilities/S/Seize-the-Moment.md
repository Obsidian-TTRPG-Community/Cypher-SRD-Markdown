### Seize the Moment

(4+ Speed points)

If you succeed on a Speed defense roll to resist an attack, you gain an action. You can use the action immediately even if you have already taken a turn in the round. You donâ€™t take an action during the next round, unless you apply a level of Effort when you use Seize the Moment. Enabler.
