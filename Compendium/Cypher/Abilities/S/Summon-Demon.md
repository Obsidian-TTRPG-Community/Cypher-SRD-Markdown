### Summon Demon

(7+ Intellect points)

A demon appears within immediate range. If you applied a level of Effort as part of the summoning, the demon is amenable to your instructions; otherwise, it acts according to its nature. Regardless, the demon persists for up to one minute before it fades awayâ€”you hope. Action to initiate.
