### Strategize

(6 Intellect points)

Having an action plan in place before facing a challenge improves the odds of success, even if that plan is eventually changed or discarded once itâ€™s put into play. If you and your allies spend at least ten minutes going over a plan of action, all of you gain one free level of Effort that can be applied to one task you attempt during the execution of that plan within the next 24 hours. The plan of action must be something concrete and executable in order to gain this benefit. Action to initiate, ten minutes to complete.
