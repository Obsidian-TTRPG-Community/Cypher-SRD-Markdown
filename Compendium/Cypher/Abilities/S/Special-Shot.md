### Special Shot

When you hit a target with a gun attack, you can choose to reduce the damage by 1 point but hit the target in a precise spot. Some of the possible effects include (but are not limited to) the following:

-   You can shoot an object out of someoneâ€™s hand.
-   You can shoot the leg, wing, or other limb it uses to move, reducing its maximum movement speed to immediate for a few days or until it receives expert medical care.
-   You can shoot a strap holding a backpack, armor, or a similarly strapped-on item so that it falls off.
