### Soothe the Savage

(2 Intellect points)

You calm a nonhuman beast within 30 feet (9 m). You must speak to it (although it doesnâ€™t need to understand your words), and it must see you. It remains calm for one minute or for as long as you focus all your attention on it. The GM has final say over what counts as a nonhuman beast, but unless some kind of deception is at work, you should know whether you can affect a creature before you attempt to use this ability on it. Aliens, extradimensional entities, very intelligent creatures, and robots never count. Action.
