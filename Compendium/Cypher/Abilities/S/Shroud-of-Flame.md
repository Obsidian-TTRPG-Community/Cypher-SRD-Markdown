### Shroud of Flame

(1 Intellect point)

At your command, your entire body becomes shrouded in flames that last up to ten minutes. The fire doesnâ€™t burn you, but it automatically inflicts 2 points of damage to anyone who tries to touch you or strike you with a melee attack. Flames from another source can still hurt you. While the shroud is active, you gain +2 Armor against damage from fire from another source. Enabler.
