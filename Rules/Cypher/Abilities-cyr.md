# Abilities

This chapter presents a vast catalog of more than a thousand abilities a character can gain from their type, flavor (if any), and focus. They are sorted alphabetically by the ability’s name.

A character’s type, flavor, and focus assign an appropriate tier to each ability. However, if you’re creating a brand-new focus or type, we provide a couple of additional tools.

The first is a power grade for each ability, which tells you about how potent it is in relation to other abilities. Abilities appropriate for tiers 1 and 2 characters are called “low-tier” abilities. Abilities appropriate for tiers 3 and 4 are called “mid-tier” abilities. Abilities appropriate for tiers 5 and 6 are called “high-tier” abilities.

These abilities are further sorted into ability categories based on the kinds of things they do—abilities that improve physical attacks are in the attack skill category, abilities that assist allies are in the support category, and so on.

(Unless otherwise noted, you cannot choose the same ability twice, even if you get it from both your type and a flavor.)

> [!important] How to Use an Ability
> To use an ability whose description says “Action”, a character must take the Activate a Special Ability action, in addition to paying the initial cost (if any).

## Ability Categories and Relative Power

Abilities can be divided into several categories based on the kinds of things they do—improve your physical attacks, assist allies, provide defense, give you a special attack form, and so on. Under each of the following category descriptions is a list of abilities that fit that category, sorted into low-, medium-, and high-tier abilities.

The categories are mainly used by GMs when designing new foci for a campaign, allowing them to search a short list of abilities instead of trying to find something appropriate among the thousand or so abilities in this chapter. For example, the GM might have a custom focus in their campaign called “Is Born of the Swamp” and want a defensive ability for tier 5, so they can look at the high-tier abilities in the protection category and quickly narrow down what options are available.

(It may be possible that a character gains the same ability from more than one source (such as from their type and their descriptor). Unless the two abilities are obviously additive (such as two abilities that each add 3 points to your Might Pool, which together would give the character +6 Might points), the duplicated ability might be improved in some way, such as having a longer duration or greater effect, or automatically providing an asset. Some abilities give suggestions on how to do this; otherwise, the player and the GM should work out whether and how the ability is improved.)

The ability categories are not intended to be rigid or comprehensive. Some abilities fall into more than one category, and it could be argued that some abilities could be included in more categories than are listed here.

These categories have some overlap with the categories in the Focus chapter. For example, there is a Support category here and a Support category in the Focus chapter. They aren’t intended to be exact parallels and they don’t mean exactly the same thing. That said, if you’re creating a support-centric focus, many of the abilities in the support ability category would be appropriate choices.

The abilities in this chapter can be roughly grouped into these categories: Attack Skill, Companion, Control, Craft, Cure, Environment, Information, Meta, Movement, Protection, Senses, Social, Special Attack, Support, Task, Transform.
